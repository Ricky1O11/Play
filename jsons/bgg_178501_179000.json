The game has solo, collaborative, and competitive modes. The cards each have a Japanese word printed on them, and are color-coded by part of speech (e.g. all verbs are red).<br/><br/>Each card has a point value, and playing the cards according to a color pattern results in a grammatically correct Japanese sentence that awards the player points equal to the sum of points on cards played. In solo mode, the player tries to reach 20 points in the fewest amount of hands. In collaborative mode, players work together to build and improve sentences until the deck runs out of cards. In competitive mode, the points a player earns on his or her turn (&quot;turn points&quot;) allow the player to eliminate cards from opponents' sentences or entire sentences if enough turn points are available.<br/><br/>This deck of Japanese: The Game differs from other decks in vocabulary and art. The vocabulary is in the theme of Japanese folk tales and mythology: sentences like &quot;Momotaro defeated all the Oni on the island&quot; and &quot;The elderly woman healed her companion&quot;. This is in contrast with, for example, the Original Core Deck of Japanese: The Game that creates much more general sentences like &quot;My dog will eat the doll&quot; and &quot;Your friend is fun.&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "average": "0", "name": "Japanese: The Game \u2013 Storyteller Deck", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Storytelling"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["155793", "192254", "192248", "155788", "192558", "155790", "192249", "192250", "155791", "192255", "155787", "192251", "192252", "192253", "155789", "192560", "192559"], "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Japanese: The Game"]}, "178525": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2538902.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Conimage"], "boardgamepublisher": ["introplus GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2538902_t.png", "minplaytime": "80", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Educational", "Negotiation", "Political", "Trivia"], "description": "Objective: be the first to get the permanent majority of votes for the coming election of the mayor - learn more about the city of Hilden (city close to D&uuml;sseldorf).<br/><br/>In turn, each player rolls the die, moves according the number, follows instructions of space landed on; buys, if possible and/or (preferable) votes.<br/><br/>&quot;Chance&quot; cards are created with circumstances out of the history of Hilden.

Players will take control of one of the games 8 mighty factions as they compete over the world's spheres of influence, capitals and oil reserves. Will a mighty caliphate rise to power? Will the communist curtain once again fall? Or will western democracy sweep the world?<br/><br/>In games with fewer than 5 players, each player will control 1-4 factions simultaneously, coordinating their efforts against the other players' coalitions. Each faction will begin the game with only a single, semi-randomly determined territory under its control. From this one space, factions will aggressively expand.<br/><br/>The gameplay of Spheres of Influence is divided into a set number of rounds, with each round being split into 2 phases: the mobilization phase and the turn phase. During the mobilization phase, factions take turns placing units based on how powerful they are. During this phase, the global turn deck is also formed. This deck will be used to determine the turn order and frequency of action for each faction during the upcoming turn phase. To form it, each faction contributes a number of their turn cards (based on the number of oil fields they control) to a single, shared deck of turn cards. This deck is then shuffled and place down on the table.<br/><br/>During the turn phase, one at a time the top card of the turn deck is revealed. Whichever faction's card was just flipped, that faction takes a turn, performing a single action with its units on a single space (moving, attacking, annexing or passing). Once that action is complete, that turn ends and the next turn card is revealed, with the process repeating itself. This makes turns both fast (with many turns lasting only a couple of seconds) and suspenseful, since none of the factions know precisely when their turns will be. It also ensures more incremental game developments - factions cannot sweep across all of Asia in a single turn and players can respond to attacks or betrayals much sooner. Once the last turn card in the global turn deck has been revealed, a round ends and another round begins.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by a simple dice mechanic fused with a &quot;situational&quot; modifier that loosely simulates the increased difficulty of attacking a defended coastline, breaking a naval blockade, or striking a fortified position. Along the way, powerful special cards can be played, allowing players to strike with submarines, deploy heavy armor, paradrop troops around enemy defenses, and launch devastating nuclear attacks.<br/><br/>Games have either 5 or 6 rounds depending on the number of factions. Once the final round is complete, the faction who controls the most spheres of influence wins the game for its owner. Games typically last about an hour and a half, and experienced players can sometimes finish in just a single hour.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Spheres of Influence: Struggle for Global Supremacy", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Point to Point Movement", "Variable Phase Order"], "average": "7.98317", "usersrated": "199", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "178551": {"rpgartist": ["Tarek Ayari", "Elena Baerald", "Valentina Bianconi", "Andrea Bilancio", "Paolo Bodini", "Denis Busatto", "Daniele Ciciriello", "Mirko Failoni", "Riccardo Latina", "Gianluca Manzo", "Matej Peklar", "Mauro Peroni", "Daniele Solfrini", "Matteo Spirito", "Dario Tommasi"], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "statistics": [], "name": "WarAge: L'Alba degli Eroi", "rpgdesigner": ["Gilbert Gallo", "Simone Raspi"], "rpgproducer": ["Matteo Ceresa", "Gionata Dal Farra"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["GG Studio"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "description": "From the publisher website:<br/>Questo manuale nasce dalla collaborazione tra Savage Worlds Italia e District Games, che pubblica il gioco di carte di Warage<br/><br/>English translation:<br/>This manual is a collaboration between Savage Worlds Italy and District Games, which publishes the card game WarAge<br/><br/>"}, "178552": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Prichard", "Rob Walz"], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Tiger's Song", "rpgartist": ["Jody Steel"], "rpgproducer": ["John Prichard", "Rob Walz"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2987785.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Save vs Boredom"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2987785_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>For the 5th edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game!<br/><br/>In the steaming jungles of the east, the Feathered City rises like a jewel from the lush forests.

Find the set that&rsquo;s right for you... or mix together characters from different sets to customize your own game!<br/><br/>A Trickster set has 49 cards with seven heroes, each with their own simple effect on play. A hero appears in seven different suits, each a color of the rainbow: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. Each hero and suit combination appears once in a set.<br/><br/>The first player of each round may play any card from her hand. The second player in the round is called The Trickster, who may also pay any card from her hand. Any subsequent player that round must play a card that follows the pattern set by the Trickster. (If the first two cards are Yellow, then everyone must play a Yellow card.)<br/><br/>If you cannot follow the pattern, you must collect cards played this round into your personal scoring area. If everyone was able to play one card, then the Trickster collects the cards.<br/><br/>The goal of Trickster is to have the fewest cards by the time any player has emptied her hand. Whoever has the fewest cards is the winner... with one exception! If you have more cards of a suit than any other player, you may ignore those cards when scoring.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "average": "7.22115", "name": "Trickster: Fantasy", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building", "Take That", "Trick-taking"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "26", "boardgamefamily": ["Guild: Game Designers of North Carolina", "Trickster"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGGcon 2015", "Blast Off With GemPacked!", "Episode 13: Starter Guide to Cons", "Episode 15: Trickster, Princess Bride, Firefly, Oh My!"]}, "178596": {"rpgartist": ["Artsteady", "Elia Bonetti", "Manuel Bracchi", "Matteo Buffagni", "Manuel Strali di Astral", "Emilio Laisio", "Ryan Lovelock", "Emanuela Lupacchino", "Michel Mammi", "Chiara Montanari", "Mattia Semini Righi", "Alessandro Rivaroli", "Riccardo Rullo", "Piergiorgio Savino", "Mattia Sterzi", "Stefano Villa", "Salvatore Villirillo", "Luca Zavattini"], "rpgitemversion": ["Core Rulebook PDF version", "Manuale Base Hardcover version", "Manuale Base PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "#UrbanHeroes Manuale Base", "rpgdesigner": ["Matteo Botti", "Alessandro Rivaroli"], "rpgproducer": ["Manuel Strali di Astral", "Eleonora Turchi Sassi"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3324616.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Tin Hat Games"], "rpg": ["#UrbanHeroes"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3324616_t.jpg", "description": "From the game website:<br/>Portare una maschera, nascondere il proprio volto, celare le proprie intenzioni, diventare qualcos&rsquo;altro.<br/>In Terra Z chi tenta di nascondersi dietro un simbolo vive sotto una costante minaccia: che l&rsquo;Uomo dietro la maschera mostri al mondo il suo vero volto.<br/><br/>English translation:<br/>Wearing a mask, hiding your face, concealing your intentions, becoming something else.<br/>In the Z Earth who tries to hide behind a symbol lives under a constant threat: that the Man behind the mask would show  its true face to the world.<br/><br/>"}, "178598": {"rpgdesigner": ["Matteo Botti", "Alessandro Rivaroli"], "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Blackout", "rpgartist": ["Alessandro Rivaroli", "Andrea Rossi", "Riccardo Rullo", "Stefano Villa"], "rpgproducer": ["Manuel Strali di Astral"], "rpg": ["#UrbanHeroes"], "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "average": "0", "description": "From the game website:<br/>Con BLACKOUT avrete uno scenario completamente nuovo per ambientare le avventure dei vostri H.E.R.O.es nella pericolosa Terra Z, nuovi spunti di gioco, nuove forze in campo ed un inquietante sfondo narrativo sempre pi&ugrave; complesso e articolato.<br/><br/>English translation:<br/>BLACKOUT is a completely new setting for the adventures of your heroes in the dangerous Earth Z, new ideas for the game, new forces in the field and a disturbing background increasingly complex and articulated.<br/><br/>"}, "178599": {"rpgdesigner": ["Alessandro Rivaroli"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover version"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Fifth", "rpgartist": ["Alessandro Rivaroli"], "rpgproducer": ["Matteo Botti", "Manuel Strali di Astral"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3354538.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Tin Hat Games"], "rpg": ["#UrbanHeroes"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3354538_t.png", "description": "From the game website:<br/>Prima che il BLACKOUT sconvolgesse Terra Z, prima che gli Eoni facessero il loro ingresso nella nostra realt&agrave;, un gruppo di comuni umani si stanno godendo una rilassante crociera a bordo della lussuosa Felicitas, nave di punta della famosa compagnia Amerigo.<br/><br/>English translation:<br/>Before the BLACKOUT upset Terra Z, before the Eons came into our reality, a group of common human are enjoying a relaxing cruise aboard the luxury Felicitas, flagship of the famous Amerigo company .<br/><br/>"}, "178600": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Cory S.

Strong Soviet forces, including the 1st Tank and 5th Mechanized Armies, conducted a concerted attack against German positions in an attempt to block relief efforts directed at Stalingrad from the west.

Trolls are no different in this regard, and while many of the trolls in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game are not very well inclined towards magic, trolls in other fantasy media are rife with strange, primitive rituals and shamanistic traditions, the flavor of which we attempt to capture with the spells in this book.<br/><br/>This book contains 11 new spells for a wide variety of spell lists, all of which are thematically linked to the primitive (but no less effective) magic of trolls. Burst of vigor can grant powerful regeneration in combat, or improve the target&rsquo;s existing regeneration, but comes at the cost of weakening the target when the spell ends. Create cave allows you to create an extradimensional cave from any rock surface, an ability especially useful for victims of the curse of sunstone, which causes the target to be petrified in direct sunlight.  Perhaps the most potent troll spell, heart regrowth allows creatures with regeneration to remove their still-beating heart and hide it away somewhere, allowing them to regenerate from their heart rather than their corpse, should they die.<br/><br/>Whether you&rsquo;re looking for unique and exciting spells for your trolls or similarly savage NPCs, or just want to expand your wizard&rsquo;s ever-growing spellbook, the magic of trolls is not to be overlooked!<br/><br/>"}, "178660": {"rpgdesigner": ["Scott Corum", "Victor Gipson"], "rpg": ["Hot Chicks", "Victory System"], "statistics": [], "name": "2018: The War for Hell", "rpgartist": ["Scott Corum", "Victor Gipson"], "rpgproducer": ["Scott Corum"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2542307.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Adult / Mature", "Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Modern (Near Future)", "Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dakkar Unlimited"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2542307_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Last Book in the &quot;Hot Chicks&quot; Line!<br/><br/>Things got bad for humanity in 2015; Aliens, Demons, and Human Greed threatened to put all of mankind of the dinner plate.

Messages were sent to the various schools of magic, informing them that the great Obryn Sapravda, Master of the Animative Arts, was almost ready to open his research laboratory, and would be taking petitions from wealthy families to apprentice their children.<br/><br/>But then all correspondence ceased.  The dwarven laborers were dismissed, but would say nothing of what had happened to the great wizard, nor would they reveal the location of his laboratory in the mountains.  Rumors began in the circles of wizardry that Master Obryn had delved too deeply into the dark arts, and that he had gone insane.  Others suggested that he had summoned a creature from beyond the pale, only to become its slave, still others that his animated constructs had gone berserk and torn him to shreds.  No one seemed interested in the truth, all were content to accept one rumor or another, and soon the once powerful wizard faded from memory.<br/><br/>But now the long lost abode of Obryn Sapravda has been found!

Every Druid has a unique ability, and with the use of movement, standard actions, action cards, and well planned strategy, they set out to transform the land to their liking.<br/><br/>It's not worker placement, it's not tile placement, it's tile manipulation! No dice to decide your fate - just your cunning, wits, and planning. Are you ready to transform the land to the way you want it? After all, you are a Druid; you should be able to do that without any problem. But watch out for the other Druids disrupting your terraforming!<br/><br/>You win the game by completing your personal goal - even on someone else's turn! To complete your goal, all terrain tiles specified on your Goal Card must be face-up on the game board in the layout specified. While you are trying to complete your goal, your opponents are also trying to complete their own - which could disrupt your tactics and planning.<br/><br/>The standard game is played on a field of Terrain Tiles laid out in a 5 x 5 configuration. On your turn, you may Pass (take no moves or actions) and draw a Spell Card. Or you may take one Move Action, one Standard Action, and as many Free Actions as you desire (in ANY order). Then at the end of your turn, draw one Spell Card (yes, that means if you Pass, you get two Spell Cards). Download the Rules to learn how all the Actions work.<br/><br/>The Terrain Tiles are double sided and represent many types of terrain like mountains, water, desert, grassland, and frozen tundra, as well as special areas like a village or a tavern. But there are two very special terrain types: there is the Mystical Wild Tile that is a wild Terrain Tile, and then there is the Void Tile that no player can move through or land on.<br/><br/>Included with the game are four variants: one to make the game easier, one to make the game longer and more challenging, one that increases the size of the game area (to 6 x 6 tiles), and then there is the Black Druid variant, who adds a truly chaotic element to the game.<br/><br/>"}, "178732": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Project H.O.P.E."], "statistics": [], "name": "Sekai dai Ichi: i migliori del mondo", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Second edition", "Softcover Version"], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)", "War"], "rpgpublisher": ["Limana Umanita Edizioni"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "description": "From the publisher website:<br/>In Sekai dai Ichi troverete: un&rsquo;esaustiva descrizione dello scenario bellico del Pacifico.

It blends classic survival horror &amp; RPG themes with intense tactical combat, to provide a cinematic and truly unique gaming experience.<br/><br/>The Z War One Issue #1 box set contains the extended first issue of the comic, along with the base set of models &amp; boards you need to start playing the game. Each subsequent comic book acts as an expansion pack, continuing the game's epic story, whilst introducing new miniatures, game mechanics &amp; environments along the way.<br/><br/>Players take control of one of 4 main protaganists, completing chapters &amp; gaining vital experience points, with which they must upgrade their character if they are to have any hope of surviving the increasingly nightmarish scenarios.<br/><br/>In addition to the game's co-operative comic book campaign, the quick-play &quot;Director Mode&quot; allows one player to connect with their devious side, using director cards to stack the odds in favour of the infected hordes!<br/><br/>Although there are multiple ways in which Z War One can be played, the real heart of the game lies in it's 1-4 player co-operative comic book campaign. The Season One 6 issue campaign is made up of 26 exciting chapters, with the climax of each chapter taking place on the game board. The cinematic mood created by the comic carries through directly into the game play, as time limits &amp; set pieces drive the story forward at a breakneck pace. The missions themselves, whilst working from the same core set of game mechanics, vary widely in tone, from exploration &amp; tense survival horror to all-out pitched battles and daring escapes.<br/><br/>Whilst the co-operative campaign is by no means easy, for more experienced players, there is the &quot;Directors Cut&quot; which adds game play elements from the quick play &quot;Director Mode&quot; to the campaign, essentially allowing a 5th player to participate and make life hell for the heroes.<br/><br/>"}, "178755": {"rpgartist": ["Irene Campos", "James Hall"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Saggakar Primer", "rpgdesigner": ["Jean-Philipe Chapleau"], "rpgproducer": ["Jean-Philipe Chapleau"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2544416.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Tyrants of Saggakar"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["First Ones Entertainment"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2544416_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The following is a short primer to allow you to start creating characters for the Legacies campaign.

That's why WOM is a very comfortable way to have an interactive break wherever you are!<br/><br/>Every mythology is presented by 12 gods and goddesses<br/><br/>Greek gods: Zeus (12), Poseidon (11), Hera (10), Hades (9), Ares (8), Athena (7), Hermes (6), Hephaestus (5), Artemis (4), Dionysus (3), Apollo (2), Aphrodite (1).<br/><br/>Egyptian gods: Ra (12), Geb (11), Tefnut (10), Osiris (9), Horus (8), Nephtys (7), Set (6), Anubis (5), Isis (4), Toth (3), Ptah (2), Hathor (1).<br/><br/>Norse gods: Odin (12), Thor (11), Frigg (10), Loki (9), Tyr (8), Hel (7), Heimdall (6), Njord (5), Skadi (4), Forseti (3), Bragi (2), Freyja (1).<br/><br/>Slavic gods: Perun (12), Dazhbog (11), Dodola (10), Veles (9), Triglav (8), Morana (7), Stribog (6), Svarog (5), Vesna (4), Hors (3), Jarilo (2), Lada (1).<br/><br/>Playing cards are really simple and graphic because all detailed information moved to the big player cards. After some days of playing you will easily recognize all powers by gods and icons.<br/>So let's start the game:<br/><br/>1. Every player gets a random player card with a mythology (a trump for that game round) and gods' powers description.<br/><br/>2. All players receive a hand of 4 random cards from the shared deck.<br/><br/>3. Dealer shows a random card from the shared deck to assign a player for the first move.<br/><br/>4. WOM is a circle card game, so every player has to play 1 card per game circle: by beating previous card or dropping his card to opponent's stake.<br/><br/>5. You can beat an opponent's card with a senior card from the same mythology (Zeus with his 12 points beats any Greek card) or with a god from your mythology (your trump) if his armor is strong enough (trump Hera with her 10 points beats gods from other mythologies with their 1 to 12 points).<br/><br/>6. When you play a card from your mythology (your trump), you use its special power automatically. You should read aloud a power description from your player card to all the opponents.<br/><br/>7. The winner of the circle takes all 4 cards to his stake (his earned points deck). But sometimes the winner can lose some cards from his stake due to gods' special powers.<br/><br/>8. All players take 1 card from the shared deck. New circle begins with the previous circle winner's move.<br/><br/>9. The game round ends when the shared deck and playing cards end. It's time to count points from the stake. The winner of the game round becomes a dealer.<br/><br/>10. You can play either by rounds (counting just victories) or by reaching to the exact point level (victory by reaching 500 points, for example).<br/><br/>Every character has a special power and an armor. Powers are based on ancient myths (Zeus beats opponents with a lightning and Thor can use a thunder hammer, for example).<br/><br/>Armor level depends on god's position in adapted mythological hierarchy. <br/>There are gods and goddesses in every mythology whose power is to summon a special card.<br/><br/>There are 3 types of special cards: Wealth, Secret and War. Work on special cards art is still in process, so they will be much more beautiful!<br/><br/>Wealth is a card with bonus points: +10 (6 items), +20 (3 items), +30 (1 item). Available for Apollo (arts), Ptah (arts), Isis (fertility), Bragi (poetry) and Jarilo (fertility).<br/><br/>Secret is a card with a secret combination bonus: &quot;Get +5 points for each Greek card in your stake&quot;, for example. Available for Athena (wisdom), Toth (knowledge), Frigg (wisdom) and Vesna (nature).<br/><br/>War is a deck of two cards: Death and Life. It's available for all gods of war: Ares, Horus, Skanda, Tyr and Triglav. If you play the god of war from your mythology, your opponents have to play risky mini game similar to Russian Roulette.<br/><br/>Also in stretching goals we announce great future decks: Hindu gods, Chinese gods, Japanese gods, gods of Mesoamerica, gods of Science, The Outsiders and Good VS. Evil double deck.<br/><br/>"}, "178771": {"rpgdesigner": ["Albert Bailey", "clash bowley", "Klaxon Bowley"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Necklace (StarCluster 3)", "rpgartist": ["clash bowley", "Ray Otus"], "rpgproducer": ["clash bowley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2544407.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Better Mousetrap Games"], "rpg": ["StarCluster 3E Roleplaying Game"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2544407_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Necklace is the thickest part of a gas torus around a neutron star, itself a part of a close binary with a hot F-type star.

At first the players should find their way into the abandoned workshops and places of power around the City &ndash; where they will be able to acquire weapons and artifacts that enhance certain characteristics of the hero. Pathfinding is carried out with laying on the board of tiles depicting the road. Each of the players paves the way for their own, but can also use the road paved by other players. Some tiles contain a monster - if a player has laid out such tile, then a monster token is placed. Player may try to circumvent a monster, but may also fight him.<br/><br/>After all the tiles are exhausted, the Manticore awakens and begins moving in the direction of the City. If the Manticore reaches the City - all the players loose the game, so the task of the Players is to defeat the Manticore before her arrival in the City.<br/>    <br/>Battle with monsters and with the Manticore is made with a die roll. However, in addition, there are also random battle cards that determine what type of attack (magic, melee, shooting) is used in this round of the fight (see &lsquo;Conducting a fight&rsquo;). Card is opened blindly, and can bring a pleasant surprise (attack with the most developed hero&rsquo;s skill) or not pleasant.

Your love and support over the last several years has been essential in turning this from a humble collection of notes and ideas into one of the Brony community&rsquo;s most popular and longest-running game projects. We couldn&rsquo;t have done any of this without you.<br/><br/>And if you&rsquo;re new to Roleplaying is Magic, we&rsquo;d like to begin by saying welcome! Sit back and relax; we think you&rsquo;ll enjoy reading this book and playing this game as much as we&rsquo;ve enjoyed creating them.<br/><br/>You may be wondering, &quot;Just what is Roleplaying is Magic, anyway?&quot; In a nutshell, Roleplaying is Magic (or &quot;RiM&quot; for short) is a fan-created tabletop roleplaying game and storytelling system based on the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic cartoon series created by Lauren Faust and owned by Hasbro Inc. With it, up to six players and one Game Master (or &quot;GM&quot;) can have adventures in the magical land of Equestria, creating their own stories together and exploring the magic of friendship.<br/><br/>RiM is suitable for a wide variety of gamers, striving for mechanical simplicity to appeal to beginners and immersion-oriented roleplayers, as well as enough depth and complexity to satisfy veteran gamers. It emphasizes positive themes of cooperation, courage, integrity, and self-expression, to provide a meaningful experience in line with the themes and aesthetics of the original cartoon series.<br/><br/>RiM is not just for grown-up gamers, or hardcore tabletop players; we&rsquo;ve done our best to create a roleplaying game that parents, children, and siblings can all enjoy, with old friends or making new ones!<br/><br/>The guiding phrase of Roleplaying is Magic is, &quot;Canon focused, fanon friendly.&quot; This means that while we&rsquo;ve tried to stay as true to the original cartoon series as possible, we&rsquo;ve also left plenty of wiggle room for game groups to make their experiences unique; to make their Equestria truly their own.<br/><br/>A new edition of RiM has been produced after each season of the original cartoon series, to incorporate revised information presented by the series, as well as improve the design of the game in an effort to make it the best it can be. With this final 'official' version, the Season Four Edition (or &quot;S4E&quot; for short), RiM has never been better. Now even more streamlined and customizable than ever before, S4E blends previous attempts at simplification with robust gameplay mechanics and a focus on positive ethics and morality.<br/><br/>"}, "178808": {"poll": [], "name": "Kung Fury: Street Rage", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iOS edition", "Windows/Macintosh/Linux Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2544677.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Comedy", "Martial Arts", "Movie, Book, TV show"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Hello There AB"], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Hello There AB"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2544677_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Kung Fury: Street Rage is a beat 'em up game based on the movie Kung Fury.

These Surges allow the fighters to perform actions, which include moving about the battlefield, attacking enemy fighters, or other tasks performed in pursuit of victory. In addition, each commander has access to the resource Mischief. Mischief allows a commander to perform extra movement, modify a die roll, or execute other minor actions that enable him to bend the rules to his favor.

This edition is very portable, with two decks of small sized cards. One deck is the Tenbo cards, showing scoring points in values of 10P, 5P and 1P. The other deck is only the green bamboo suite (Ryuiso), hence the game being called all Green. The other Mahjong suites and tiles, such as Dragons, are not represented.<br/><br/>As in Mahjong, players repeatedly draw a card from the deck and discard one from their hand, trying to build a scoring combination from the five cards they hold after drawing. The combinations in All Green are simply a pair (the Head), and either a Run (Shuntsu) or a Meld.<br/><br/>Based upon the value of the winning hand, players discard their points cards accordingly. The first player to get down to zero wins, or the player with the fewest points after two rounds.<br/><br/>RULES:<br/><br/>From the Tenbo points deck, players get a 10P, two 5P, and five 1P cards, giving a total of 25 points.<br/><br/>Then, after shuffling the bamboo deck well, players are dealt four hand cards each. The remainder are placed face down as a draw deck. Play goes clockwise, with each player taking turns to draw one card from the deck, and discard one card from their hand.<br/><br/>Once a player has a Pair and a Run or a Meld, they call and score. Then they discard Tenbo cards for the score. Players reshuffle the bamboo deck and play another round, until one players gets to zero points. More usually, play continues until everyone has lead twice, at which point the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>\u30bd\u30fc\u30ba\u3068\u30cf\u30c4\u3060\u3051\u306e\u9ebb\u96c0\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>5\u679a\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u63c3\u3048\u308b\u7c21\u6613\u7248\u306e\u9ebb\u96c0\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c25\u70b9\u306e\u70b9\u6570\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3001\u70b9\u6570\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u5408\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br/>\u89aa\u304c2\u5468\u3059\u308b\u304b\u3001\u8ab0\u304b\u306e\u70b9\u6570\u304c0\u672a\u6e80\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3068\u7d42\u4e86\u3067\u3059\u3002<br/>ALL GREEN is a simplified Mahjong card game.

Animists commune directly with the primal being herself, offering themselves up as living clay to be shaped into a pure representation of her will. These representations, known as aspects, encompass everything from the pedestrian products of nature to the concepts and emotions that drive nature forward. Despite their range of expression, all animists are united in their adoration of their patron, and are, in essence, nature incarnate.<br/><br/>Commissioned by &quot;Sugar Momma&quot; Patreon backer Sasha Hall, the animist base class presents a new, flavorful system of druidic pact magic with an incarnum-style twist. Featuring the Prominence mechanic, animists take on different natural aspects each morning, but can choose to spend multiple aspect slots to dig deeper and deeper into a single aspect, unlocking further related abilities in a single niche at the cost of reduced versatility.

Paladins are holy knights that wade into battle armed with sword, shield, and faith. They obediently go wherever they are needed to protect the faith and serve the faithful. They have great martial prowess and potent faith-based powers. In many games, paladins also observe a strict chivalric code while maintaining vows of poverty and chastity.<br/><br/>However, paladins aren't simply the stuff of legends. In actuality, paladins were very real. Following the First Crusade, knights banded together to serve the needs of the faith and the faithful. They lived the life of a monk while simultaneously following the path of a warrior. These warrior-monks formed a highbred of monastic life that was termed Military Orders. The most famous of these orders was the Knights Templar.<br/><br/>Ultimate Knights Templar Guide is a sourcebook for the Entropic Gaming System that delves into the world of the Knights Templar from a historical and in-game aspect.

Your game mat rolls up after each use to be stored nicely in its own box and carrying case along with all other game components.<br/><br/>On the field, you'll be using real replica scoreboards and full teams consisting of 40-man rosters. You won't have to refer to a lot of charts, either, as we've printed most of what you need right there on the player tokens themselves.<br/><br/>How Games Are Played - A General Overview:<br/><br/>Games in Roll Saga Baseball are played just like games in true-life baseball. Game players act as Owners, General Managers, and Managers (OGMs) of baseball teams that consist of a full team roster of 40 players.<br/><br/>Each OGM (Owner/General Manager/Manager) selects his team and places all of the individual player tokens (each player token represents one team player) onto the field's dugout - the large white box on each side of the field. Each OGM then performs the necessary pre-game preparations like selecting a batting line-up (batting order) and choosing what starting, relief, and closing pitchers that they want to have in the game.<br/><br/>As each player comes up to bat, his player token is placed into the batter's box at home plate. The next batter in line after that batter would be placed in the on-deck circle.<br/><br/>With a batter in the batter's box, the opposing team's OGM would then control his pitcher on the mound by selecting certain types of pitches to throw, targeting the locations of those pitches (according to each individual pitches movement), and rolling 3 six sided dice to determine the success of failure of the pitching action. Each roll is augmented by that particular pitcher's pitching ability (PIT), like '+3' for example, that would be added to the roll to increase the overall sum of the total. Pitchers, just like all other players, can have special skill-sets (like Pitching Under Pressure, or Endurance, for example) that can further augment plays and increase the pitcher's overall game performance.<br/><br/>The batter (the OGM playing with the team at-bat) decides to swing, let it go (not swing) or bunt. If he decides to swing, 3 six sided dice are rolled to determine the hit success or failure and, if hit, what type of hit (grounder, hot grounder, line drive, hard line drive, or fly ball results). If a hit is made, another roll is enacted using 3 six sided dice to determine the direction and speed (power) of the hit. Just as pitchers have a PIT ability that is added to their pitch roll, batters use their batting ability (BAT) which is expressed as a 'plus' to augment their 'to hit' roll. Additionally, batters have power ratings (POW) that are used to determine how much extra a hit can travel in feet (like, +50', for example). And just as pitchers, and all other player positions, there are many different skill-sets that can be possessed by a batter (like Clutch Hitting or Place Hitting).<br/><br/>As each play is played out, all of the things that are performed in a true-life baseball game are enacted by the opposing OGMs (Owner/General Manager/Manager) like fielding the ball, throwing the ball, running the bases, stealing, playing off base, sliding into base, picking off, etc. Every single action, bar none, of baseball is accurately replicated in Roll Saga Baseball through a precise and fluid game mechanic true to the game of baseball as we know it to be.<br/><br/>As the game continues, the player tokens are moved around the game mat/field just as players in a real baseball game would move in the course of a game: coming to bat, running the bases, running in the outfield to catch hits, and throwing the ball to get the opposing team's runners out.<br/><br/>Scoring and Winning - A General Overview:<br/><br/>Each team scores points just as in baseball - by bringing a base runner into, and across, home plate.<br/><br/>To keep score, authentic replica scoreboards are used. The scoreboards are erasable (marker included) and have places to record runs, hits, errors, balls, strikes, and outs - among other things. The team with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Levels of Play:<br/><br/>Roll Saga has been designed to be very flexible in levels of play in order to ensure that those who don't know a lot about baseball can play at a level that does not require much knowledge. And, conversely, those that are baseball enthusiasts can replicate true baseball strategy and action without error.<br/><br/>It has been designed for 1 (solitaire) or two players.<br/><br/>Additionally, these levels of play can be mixed during any game so that any action or series of actions (like an inning) can be simulated and other actions can be played out. A full game can be played in as little as 30-40 minutes, or as long as it takes for a normal major league baseball game (2-3 hours) depending on what the OGMs decide during the course of game play.<br/><br/>"}, "178927": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Hidden Shallows (Issue 1 - 1977)", "rpgdesigner": ["David Langford"], "rpgproducer": ["David Langford"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2548064.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Hidden Shallows"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Comments on Clerics", "Doctor Duck's Peptonized Pills", "Masthead", "Miscellany"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (Original Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2548064_t.jpg", "description": "Introductory issue.<br/><br/>"}, "178928": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Hidden Shallows (Issue 2 - 1977)", "rpgdesigner": ["David Langford"], "rpgproducer": ["David Langford"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2548063.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Hidden Shallows"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Insanity", "Masthead", "Miscellaneous", "Vision the Second", "Visions of the Nameless Seer"], "rpg": ["Dungeons & Dragons (Original Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2548063_t.jpg", "description": "Second issue of the periodical<br/><br/>"}, "178929": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bob Brinkman"], "statistics": [], "name": "Ashen News (Issue 1 - Jul 1991)", "rpgartist": ["David Kelder"], "rpgproducer": ["Bob Brinkman", "Colin Crisanti", "Phil Nowick"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2548055.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Ashen News"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Book of Forbidden Magic", "Contents", "Editorial", "Gen Con Report", "Nightlife", "Nightlife Magic", "Submission Guidelines"], "rpg": ["AD&D Second Edition (2e) Compatible Products", "NightLife (1st - 3rd Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["Standard Edition"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2548055_t.jpg", "description": "Introductory issue (1 of 2).<br/><br/>"}, "178930": {"poll": [], "name": "Walls:  Race Through a Changing Maze", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Take That"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "17", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2637240_t.jpg", "average": "5.88824", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["PandaGM"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2637240.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Dice", "Maze"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "The game board is set up with 3D wall pieces that plug into the board, making a giant maze.

The walls pivot around a point allowing the player to open new paths to the Finish, or to block opponents' paths to the Finish.<br/><br/>There are some special moves that a player may do when the player rolls doubles:<br/>1.  Change places with another player's pawn<br/>2.  Move through walls the number rolled (Double 4's means 4 spaces through walls)<br/><br/>    Note:  If option 1 or 2 is played, then the player forfeits their option to move walls.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>3.  Simply play the roll.<br/><br/>If you are looking for something more strategic than a dice rolling game, there is a second set of rules that eliminates the dice and makes the game more strategic.<br/><br/>There is also an option to add a &quot;Bad Guy&quot; to game play.

You will find also an element of bluffing, when you fight your battles, so put the poker face on and be ready to outsmart your opponent.<br/>The game is defined by the unique combination of mechanics, aesthetic art style, and the presence of large scale 3D Hero figures in four colors, representing the leaders of the players army and their movement on the board.<br/><br/>The calendar mechanics is implemented in the Sun Oracle, shortly called Orac, as it is a key element of the game. The Oracle is almighty ancient monument, eternal apprentice of the nature itself and the hand of the gods among humans and beasts. The Oracle provides advantages to the players (every day a different one) and it could support them, if they catch the lucky moment on a sunny day... It counts the days and guides the leaders through the never-ending competition between the folks that inhabit these lands: The B&auml;rfolk, The Emberians, The Islanders and The Cloudborn.<br/>Four factions coexist in the world of Battalia.

The game ends when the Robber has gained 24 loot, or the Cop has 24 arrests.  The cop can also win by stopping the Robber from getting 24 loot after all the locations have been played.<br/><br/>The Cop and Robber each have a deck that includes Units, Items, and Actions.  The Units and Items are used to occupy the locations.  Each location requires a different number to occupy, and a specific number of turns.  There are 4 locations out at a time, and 24 locations in the game in total. The Action cards are used to affect things like occupy time, defense and attack buffs, and hand management. If a player wins a location uncontested, as a Robber they win the loot, and the Cop gets 1 more location off the game board. If the other player does contest while occupied, they must play that same number of Units and Items required against the occupied player.  Each Unit has a level and it becomes a war type-highest number wins after all levels  are added up, action cards are played, and a die is rolled.  Along with the win, the player also get an Event card, which can be played for big bonuses and affect the game positively or negatively.<br/>Lastly, each player has a home base.

The One Wombat gained his power by draining it from the Wombatonians. Eventually the Wombatonians launched their attack on the One Wombat to save themselves. In the end, the Wombatonians created six weapons called the Wombat Stones. When they used the weapons, the One Wombat split into many pieces, although its consciousness survived. The Wombat Stones became lost in six different pieces of the One Wombat. Eventually, these pieces became the planets we now know as Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and Earth. As time went on life began to grow inside them.<br/><br/>Every One Hundred Wombatonian Years a tournament is held, Wombat Combat. The evil Combat Croc has won the tournament for the past nine centuries--except suffered failure in the last Wombat Combat Tournament to the warrior known as West Wombat. Combat Croc ordered the Crocodan horde to attack the Island known as Australia on Earth. The horde raided and injured most of West Wombat's fellow warriors, including his Wombat Masters. This enraged West enough to re-enlist in this centuries tournament. He was not alone. Marauder Maus, Kaolin, and Major Waylin Bear, who was in search of his missing subordinate, Elizabeth Emu, were also following right behind West Wombat seeking revenge, and to compete in the next Wombat Combat tournament at the same time. But unbeknownst to West Wombat and the warriors, the tournament was a ruse, a diversionary trap set by the Combat Croc in an attempt to break the rules set forth by the Wombatonians, and in rescuing Elizabeth, Combat Croc's scheme was thwarted and the Combatants prevailed.<br/><br/>In retaliation Combat Croc has scheduled an unsanctioned tournament on Earth. He seeks revenge and to claim all Wombat Stones so that he may take the place that the One Wombat once held.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt one Wombatant and a Wombat Stone. Both of these cards will be laid face-up on the table in front of the player who holds them. Each Wombatant has a certain amount of hit points they can absorb before they are defeated. As attack cards are laid in front of Wombatants, the points will be deducted from the hit point total until they are expended. The object of the game is to use your Wombatant to take the Wombat stones from all the other Wombatants in the game.<br/><br/>Each player will be dealt five cards from the Combat deck. On their turn, a player has the option to play an Attack card against any opposing player, or to lay a Counter card against the Attacks already played against them. After playing an Attack or a Counter, the player draws another card from the Combat deck. When a player's hit points are consumed, their player is out, and the last Wombatant to Attack them takes their Wombat Stone. All of the Combat cards in a defeated player's hand or before them are placed in the bottom of the Combat deck.<br/><br/>The Wombatant who earns all of the Wombat Stones wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["NSFW Edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Wombat Combat", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Player Elimination", "Take That", "Variable Player Powers"], "average": "5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}}
