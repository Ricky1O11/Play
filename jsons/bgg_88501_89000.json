It was published in Japan by Asmik Ace Entertainment and in North America by DTMC in 1994.<br/><br/>In the beginning, a typical teenage boy named Lester, who is &quot;kind of geeky&quot; and &quot;kind of sleepy&quot; recently got a new issue of the Super Duper Hero Squad comic book. He reads it while walking on a dock, until he fell asleep next to a cargo crate laying beside a cargo ship. After he and the cargo were loaded onto the ship by a crane and cruised off, the ship got hijacked by pirates and started sinking. Lester luckily found a life jacket and swam toward the most adjacent island while the cargo ship sank. Lester must find his way home by exploring the island for someone or something that can help him survive.<br/><br/>The game has a unique engine in which the protagonist, Lester, is easily frightened early in the game and will act reluctantly when faced with animals, heights, etc. For instance, when the player guides Lester towards a crab in the first stage, he will at first scream and run in the opposite direction; when the player makes him walk towards it a second time he will slowly creep towards it. This coincides with one of the major themes of the game being Lester facing his fears, and these instances happen less and less as the game goes on.<br/>Also notable are the game's rotoscoped graphics, referred to in the game's manual as &quot;Filmed in Geek-O-Vision.&quot; The manual boasts that the Lester character has over 250 frames of animation, &quot;about twice the number of an average game.&quot;<br/><br/>The first part of the game depicts Lester as a very cowardly character. Every time he encounters a new creature, he runs away in the opposite direction with a scream (temporarily removing the controls from the player's hand). Upon approaching the creature a second time, Lester walks slowly, protecting himself with his arms. Once a certain type of creature has been defeated, the player will be able to walk to this type of creature without any further sign of fear. At the beginning of the game, Lester walks in a very lazy, laid-back stance, suggesting weakness and lack of courage. However, after saving an indigenous girl from a huge gorilla, the girl gives a kiss to the hero and he is suddenly changed. In the following levels, Lester has a very upright and courageous stance.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Lester the unlikely&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "88509": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Markus Hagenauer"], "poll": [], "name": "Hey!

Albert Sidney Johnston&rsquo;s Army of Mississippi destroyed the Union&rsquo;s Army of the Tennessee at Shiloh in April 1862, it brought despair to a Northern public already restive over the war&rsquo;s course. A few weeks later the entire world saw how a single Confederate ironclad could isolate the Union&rsquo;s Army of the Potomac on the Virginia Peninsula; the Union ship that might have saved the day, the ironclad Monitor, had been swamped in heavy seas and sank before it could arrive on the scene. With no help of reinforcement, resupply or rescue and Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s Army of Northern Virginia launching incessant attacks, George McClellan surrendered his command. The American Civil War was over after roughly a year of fighting.<br/><br/>Fifty years later, the United States and Confederate States share a divided continent. The South has expanded into the Caribbean Basin and Central America, cutting a canal across Nicaragua and establishing new states and territories. Under pressure from their British and French allies, the Confederate States gradually eliminated slavery, but severe class and racial tensions remain. Northern politicians know talk of re-unification is an easy crowd-pleaser; even the United States Navy continues to name warships for Southern states and cities.<br/><br/>War in Europe has finally brought the long-simmering American feud into open conflict. The United States, pressured by its German allies, seeks to disrupt trade through the Caribbean Basin and deny these resources to the Allied war effort. The Confederacy, outnumbered and outgunned by its rival, must protect its economic lifelines if it is to survive as an independent state.<br/><br/>Confederate States Navy is a supplement for the Great War at Sea series, based on battles that never happened, waged by a fleet that never existed.

Its addictive qualities go way beyond your standard card game. Get hooked today!<br/><br/>From the Developer's Website:<br/><br/>The game Astral Masters combines the best features of the computer game Astral Tournament and collectible card games while dispensing with the &quot;collectible&quot; part. Two players compete, each fighting against the other by casting various spells and summoning fantastic creatures. You can play either against the computer (both in single games and in tournaments) or against other people.<br/><br/>The game is easy to learn and does not require previous knowledge of other card games.<br/><br/>1. Main game parameters.<br/><br/>Each player is represented in-game by a mage having three main characteristics.<br/><br/>The first of them is Life. A mage begins a duel having a certain amount of Life which will vary higher or lower during the course of the match. If at any moment the mage's life drops to zero or less, he is considered defeated.<br/><br/>The second main parameter is Astral Power, which in a nutshell determines your mage's magical prowess. Higher Astral Power means your mage will be able to cast higher cost spells. Each player begins the game with their amount of Astral power equal to zero. As a result of the players' actions each turn, Astral Power will generally increase over the course of the duel.<br/><br/>The third main parameter is Mana, and it is directly related to Astral Power. At the beginning of each turn Mana is reset to equal the mage's current Astral Power. Basically any action the player takes requires him to expend a certain amount of Mana. If there isn't enough Mana for the action it can not be performed.<br/><br/>2. Cards and their use.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a deck of cards and at the beginning of the duel, and is delt a hand from his respective deck. In the process of playing he gets one more card at the beginning of each turn. Also the player can receive cards as an effect of different spells and some creatures' abilities. Maximum number of cards you can have in the hand is 8.<br/><br/>Cards can be of two types: creatures and spells. Each card has a Mana cost. Creatures summoned by the player to the battlefield will stay and fight to the death, while spells cause a certain immediate impact on the game situation. When a player summons a creature or spell, the respective card must be played from his hand. Otherwise, play of cards is only limited by the amount of Mana available.<br/><br/>Besides using cards for summoning creatures/spells, players can sacrifice one card per turn. The sacrificed card is discarded from the player's hand and both Astral Power and Mana are increased by 1. I.e. during the duel the player constantly makes a choice between which cards to discard so as to build up Astral Power and which cards to use to play against the enemy.<br/><br/>3. Creatures, slots and attack process.<br/><br/>Each creature has two stats: Attack Strength and Life. If the creature attacks any opposing creature, that defending creature's life is reduced by the attack strength of the attacking creature. If the creature's life is reduced to 0, the creature dies. Each player has 6 creature slots that can hold summoned creatures. If all the slots are full the player can't summon any more creatures - he can only cast spells.<br/><br/>At the end of a player's turn, all deployed creatures he controls attack the enemy. Each creature attacks separately. Enemy creatures in opposing slots absorb any damage from these attacks. However, if the creature attacks an empty slot, the attack directly injures the opponent.<br/><br/>4. Creatures' abilities.<br/><br/>Many creatures possess various abilities. There are three kinds of abilities:<br/><br/>* Permanent abilities. These abilities are always active, regardless of what else happens in the game. For example, Wall of Peace decreases the attack of all enemy's creatures by 1. This effect is active all the time while Wall of Peace remains in the game.<br/>    * Trigger Abilities. These abilities are triggered automatically when a particular event occurs, such as when a card is gained, a creature is deployed or a spell is cast. For example, Astral Chaneller increases the controlling mage's Astral Power by 1 each time a freindly creature with a Mana cost of 4 or greater is summoned into play.<br/>    * Secondary Abilities. These abilities are only activated if the creature's owner pays the necessary amount of Mana. Such abilities can be used only once per turn for each creature. For example, for 1 Mana the Elven Archer can conduct a ranged attack against any enemy creature and inflict 4 damage points.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website. with a lot of editing for grammar and clarity!!!<br/><br/>"}, "88563": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Joshua Buergel"], "average": "4.5", "poll": [], "name": "Foresight", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Aaron Williams"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "House of Slack Games"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "(from publisher's website)<br/><br/>Foresight is a unique deck of cards, unlike any other deck you&rsquo;ve ever used.  The cards are familiar, as long as you&rsquo;re looking at the fronts, lovingly illustrated by Aaron Williams. But on the back, one or more suits appear, giving you a glimpse into the future.  The better the card, the less information you have about what suit it is.  That ability to look into the future gives the game its shape, and presents some unique challenges for the veteran card player.<br/><br/>Foresight is also an engaging trick-taking card game, using that special set of cards.  The bidding system is at once familiar, a simple system of bidding how many tricks you are going to take, and different, in that you get to bid multiple times.  As befits a game with as much uncertainty as Foresight features, you get to place several bets, rather than be locked down into one bid.  And once play begins, part of your hand is obscured even from you.  Managing your information and your crucial hole cards is a skill that is unique to playing Foresight, and it&rsquo;s a fresh challenge that card players everywhere can appreciate.<br/><br/>"}, "88564": {"poll": [], "name": "Phat Fly", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition", "Xbox 360 XBLA edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic870024.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Animals"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Berzerker Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone", "Xbox 360"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Berzerker Games"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic870024_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In Phat Fly you control a fly trying to survive.

Players construct a modular board and then strategically position their dice to make a capture. When two dice connect, the die with the highest facing side wins.<br/><br/>SET UP:<br/><br/>1) The board:<br/>Each player picks two colors of Nestortiles and takes all the tiles of those colors. The rest of the tiles are shuffled face down and patched together into a 6x6 grid. The grid is flipped over, revealing the pattern of pips. This will be used as the game board.<br/><br/>2) The dice:<br/>Players now use their twelve Nestortiles to assemble two dice in any way they please.<br/><br/>3) Placing the dice on the board:<br/>Players now place their dice in the corners of their own side of the game board with any side face up, so long as it does not match the number of the tile the die is on. Who ever is start player should place his or her dice first, giving the second player a chance to evaluate the position and place his or her dice accordingly.<br/><br/>Example: In one of Eva's corners, there is a tile with four pips. She may place either of her dice in this corner, so long as it is not showing 4 pips on its top face. Once she places both of her dice, it will be Nestor's turn to place his. Then Eva will make the first move.<br/><br/>Players may decide turn order in any manner they like. Start player will alternate each round.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE:<br/>The first player to &quot;capture&quot; one of the other player's dice wins the round. First player to win 3 rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>1) Moving dice:<br/>When players take their turns, they move one of their dice three times. Moving a die means &quot;tilting&quot; it on to the next space forward, backward, left, or right, so that the top face of the die becomes the side facing that direction.<br/><br/>Example: Eva will play first. She decides to move her die that shows a green 5 on top. First, she will move it one space forward. Eva now tilts the die forward so that the green 5 faces forward and the die rests squarely on the next tile forward.<br/><br/>Now this same die shows a blue 2 on top and she wants to move this one space to the left. She tilts the die to the left so that the blue 2 is now the side facing left and the die lands squarely on the next tile to the left..<br/><br/>Now this die has a blue 5 on top, and Eva wants to move it one more space forward, so she tilts the die forward, moving the die onto the next tile forward so that his blue 5 faces forward, toward her opponent. Eva's turn is turn is now over.<br/><br/>At no point during a player's turn may they move their die back onto a tile it has already touched during the same turn. This means players cannot retrace their path or repeat moves during the same turn.<br/><br/>Dice may not be moved diagonally. Dice may not be rotated.<br/><br/>2) Making a capture:<br/>When two opposing dice are in adjacent squares, their facing sides are compared. The die with the highest value on its facing side captures the other and the round is over.<br/><br/>Example: One of Nestor's dice shows a 4 on one side. Eva is able to move her die so that it ends on the space adjacent to this side with a value of 5 facing Nestor's 4. Eva's 5 beats Nestor's 4, so Eva wins the round.<br/><br/>Dice cannot be captured &quot;in passing.&quot; In other words, the sides of dice are not compared for a capture unless a player has completed all three moves of his or her turn. If dice are in adjacent squares on the first or second move of a turn, there is no comparison of sides and no capture.<br/><br/>Sometimes, a die will end a turn on a &quot;matching&quot; tile. A die is said to be on a matching tile when its top face is of the same value as the tile. When a die is on a matching tile, all of its outward facing sides double in value for as long as the die remains on the matching tile. This means it may capture a die showing a side of greater value than it would normally be able to capture.<br/><br/>Example: One of Eva's dice is on a matching space, and its outward facing sides show values of 2, 3, 4, and 4. Because she is on a matching tile, their values are now 4, 6, 8, and 8. As soon as she moves off the tile, their values will return to normal.<br/><br/>Let's say Eva ended her turn on a matching tile that is adjacent to one of Nestor's dice. His die shows a 6 facing hers, and her die shows a 4 facing his. Ordinarily Eva would lose the round in this position, but because she is on a matching tile, the value of her 4 doubles to an 8. Her 8 beats Nestor's 6 and she wins the round.<br/><br/>If dice are compared for capture and their values are equal, no capture takes place on that turn.<br/><br/>STARTING A NEW ROUND<br/><br/>Once a capture has been made, players collect their dice and prepare for a new round. Players should decide before a game begins whether or not they want the ability to remake their dice between rounds. Unless otherwise stated, dice should retain their composition for the duration of the game, and the board should likewise remain intact for all 3-5 rounds.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has won three rounds and is declared the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "88606": {"rpgartist": ["Scott Purdy"], "rpgitemversion": ["Soft Cover"], "poll": [], "name": "Primeval Groves", "rpgdesigner": ["Andrew Troman"], "rpgproducer": ["Jason Braun", "Joseph Goodman", "Andy Hopp"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic916958.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Goodman Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic916958_t.jpg", "description": "Primeval Groves: The Wanderers Guild Guide to Dangerous &amp; Unusual Plantlife<br/><br/>From the back of the book:<br/>The bounty of life surrounds us all and yet most of you will never see the true beauty and horror that the mother earth has given us.<br/><br/>From the usefulness of the Goodberry plant and the Gub Nut to the seething hatred running through the sap of the Pine Brethren mother earth can be a most temperamental bed fellow.

The game dates back to the turn of the 18th century and is based on xiangqi and go as well as shogi. Credit for its invention has been given to Confucian scholar Ogy\u016b Sorai. Unlike standard shogi, pieces may not be dropped back into play after being captured. Promotion rules are complex, and the fates of several pieces are interdependent. The objective is to capture the opponent's commanding pieces: The general, plus the governor if present, or either the banner or middle army if not. Two players, Black and White, play on a go board ruled into a grid of 19 ranks (rows) by 19 files (columns) with a total of 361 intersections. Each player has a set of 90 pieces of 34 different types. The pieces are round and flattened like go stones. In all, the players must remember 65 different moves. The pieces are generally of the same size, though black pieces may be slightly larger than white pieces. Each piece has its name in the form of one or two Japanese characters marked on its face, in white on black stones and in black on white stones. On the reverse side of most pieces are other characters in red; this side is turned up to indicate that the piece has been promoted during play. - Wiki (<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_shogi' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_shogi</a>)<br/><br/>"}, "88650": {"rpgartist": ["Drew Baker", "Sheldon Dawson", "Marcio Fiorito", "Don Higgins", "Bradley McDevitt", "John McSweeney", "Morningstar Maps", "Nigel Sade"], "statistics": [], "name": "Buccaneers & Bokor (Volume 1, Issue 1 - Oct/Nov 2003)", "rpgdesigner": ["T.

The controls are simple, intuitive and fun!<br/><br/>The key to success is to use the wide-range of powerful level objects in a given map and link together hilarious chain reactions that wipe out your targets. A hammer will send steel balls flying. Cogs will channel objects into a given area. Conveyor belts will deposit souls into pits. There are a variety of ways of completing each map, but you'll earn more halos by using as many of these tools as possible<br/><br/>Customization is key! At the start of each round, you add objects - such as sticks of dynamite, ramps and steel balls - into the map that will dramatically alter the outcome. Place them into the map and then go for broke! You'll earn more points for placing fewer objects, so finding that right balance of placed objects and skilled throws will pave the way for a destructive victory!<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "88668": {"poll": [], "name": "Garfield: Caught in the Act", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Genesis edition", "US Windows CD-ROM edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2348132.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Furries / Talking Animals"], "videogamefranchise": ["Garfield"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Point of View", "SEGA Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Genesis", "Windows"], "usersrated": "3", "average": "4.33333", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2348132_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In Garfield: Caught in the act, Garfield is scared by Odie while he is watching television.

This is achieved by collecting arcane tomes of power &amp; the chest of ultimate secrets, or by destroying your enemies minions with devastating spells and hordes of undead monsters.<br/><br/>This game has been taken to several war gaming conventions in the uK where it achieved Best Participation game at Warfare (Reading 2010)<br/><br/>The games consists of 4 players each representing a Necromancer in charge of an undead horde. To begin with eaxh player has 3 ghouls, these are; fast, good at searching but weak in combat. During each turn the players will raise a skeleton and a zombie to supplement their force. So more figures will enter play as the game progresses. The turn order is determined randomly by pulling stones from a bag. There are six stones, one for each player and the other two represent the resurrection of skeleton &amp; zombie. When a players stone is drawn, they are allowed to move all their figures. No diagonal movement is allowed, nor are you allowed to enter a space occupied by other players pieces, and finally there's a stcking limit of 4 figures per area. After moving any figures against to an enemy must fight (this is compulsory), otherwise they may search for artifacts. Specially prepared dice are used for both searching &amp; combat. These dice have the following faces; 2 x swords, 1 x shield, 2 x eye and 1 x swirl. During searching a number of dice are rolled, if any show the 'eye' the item has been found and will need to be carried back to the Necromancer in order to be used or scored. In combat, both players roll their respective dice, lokking for swords or shields. Basically a shield will negate a sword, any any excess swords on either side will kill a minion each. Spells can be played to influence the outcome of a battle ie 'Battle rage' - All swirls count as swords, thereby increasing your chance of killing your opponents figures.<br/><br/>zombies are slow, not good in searching but the best fighters, skeletons are average across the board. The Necromancer himself, is very good at searching, but otherwise similar to a skeleton.Points are awarded for kills and for collecting items. The first player to acquire 25 points wins. Sets of gems are worth more than singles, scrolls give you another spell but are not worth any points, relics are worth 2 points, the chest is 4 (this is placed in the centre of the board) and potions are worth 1 but can be used in combat to roll an extra die. Kills are worth 2 points each, however the Necromancer is immortal so each wound he takes is worth 2.<br/><br/>"}, "88672": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tomoki Kondoh"], "poll": [], "name": "Iron bottom & Sunset sky", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic888319_t.jpg", "average": "7.94", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Game Journal"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic888319.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Game Journal version"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Nautical", "World War II"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "A cardgame for 2 players which simulates battle of Savo island in 1942-43.

A player can also win by fulfilling a bubble quota marked in the centre of the screen.<br/><br/>Drop III has three game modes that can be played.

Story Mode pits the player against a series of progressively stronger opponents in head-to-head matchups.

Terra Shrinka has a unique lunar tide system that controls the water and will erode the island if you don't work together to scout out the island, gather resources, and build dams fast enough.<br/><br/>THE STORY SO FAR<br/><br/>On a South Pacific flight your plane is struck by lighting and makes an emergency landing on a small desert island.  The good news is that everyone survived the landing, the bad news is that the tides are rising and the island is flooding.  It's up to the brave passengers to step forward and bring order to the chaos.  You survived the crash, now can you survive the flood?  The very earth is shrinking around you!  Can you dam the flood?<br/><br/>THE OBJECTIVE<br/><br/>Dam the flood by creating an unbroken chain of dams from one board edge to the other and protect the crash-site in the process!<br/><br/>HOW THE GAME PLAYS<br/><br/>The game starts with the board taking its turn. The board&rsquo;s turn is broken into five phases:<br/><br/>1. Move Moon Tracker<br/>2. Add Flood Cube(s)<br/>3. Roll Moon Die that matches current Moon Phase<br/>4. Draw card if &ldquo;N&rdquo; or &ldquo;S&rdquo; is rolled.<br/>5. Move Flood water and resolve damage<br/><br/>After the water does a good job of destroying board squares, it is the players&rsquo; turn. Each player starts with their Team Leader in the Crash Site. During the players&rsquo; turn, they do the following:<br/><br/>1. Explore and Move<br/>2. Create<br/>3. Transfer<br/>4. Set Dams<br/><br/>Each player has a starting character. Are you the ren-faire blacksmith, or are you the bag lady? No matter whom, it is each team&rsquo;s job to explore this uncharted little island. The survivors find food to bribe more recruits off the plane. They make networks of people to transfer gathered goods. And finally, they create and set dams to stop the water. This requires lots of communication and teamwork to protect your Crash Site and stop the water from spreading any more. If your Crash Site is destroyed, you lose. Otherwise, keep track of how many squares were destroyed when you finally blocked off the flood and try to do better next time.

To win, a driver must finish in first place out of 4 ranks. Drivers can drift to earn nitro boosts and do barrel rolls for shields, which prevent drivers from receiving damage and may ricochet gunfire back to snipers. The time it takes for drivers to finish a race can represent their ranks in the leaderboards.<br/><br/>There are four vehicles, each with three attributes: speed (which affects top speed and acceleration), armor (which affects the amount of damage the vehicle can take), and handling (which affects steering and drifting).<br/><br/>Buggy - Has good speed and handling, but the worst armor. <br/>Pickup - Has average speed and armor, but the best handling. It is recommended for beginners. <br/>Truck - Also has average speed as well as handling, but the best armor. <br/>Bus - Has the best speed and good armor, but the worst handling.<br/><br/>Shooter<br/>Shooters can snipe other vehicles and damage them. The shooters' goal is to damage and destroy the vehicle as badly as possible. A fatal hit to the windshield of a vehicle will instantly destroy it, giving the shooter 5000 points. Shooters can also hit wheels to stop or slow down a vehicle for 250 points. Shooters can also shoot at power-ups on the track to either prevent drivers from using them or to upgrade their own turrets with new weapons. The number of points snipers earn can represent their ranks in the leaderboards.<br/><br/>There are four weapons for each shooter, each available after certain number of upgrades:<br/><br/>Sniper rifle - A powerful single shot from a sniper rifle can cause windshield kills and flat tires. Also has good zooming capabilities and a laser pointer that's also visible to drivers, though it's slow to reload. This is the weapon that shooters start out with. <br/>Burst Shot - A machine gun which rapidly fires relatively weak rounds. Has some zooming capabilities and is prone to overheating. This is the first weapon that shooters receive from upgrading. <br/>Air Strike - Launches a group of land mines from the air and onto the track, detonating automatically if untouched for five seconds. This weapon is earned after two upgrades. <br/>Missile launcher - A rocket launcher that can lock onto moving targets and cause heavy damage, which is strong enough to knock down objects that can fall onto drivers and block the road. It fires in straight lines by default. This is the last weapon that shooters can earn, requiring three upgrades.<br/><br/>Power-ups<br/>There are five power-ups in the game that affects both drivers and snipers:<br/><br/>Nitro - Give vehicles a small amount of nitrous that allows drivers to gain speed when they want to use it. <br/>Shield - Give vehicles temporary invulnerability and may cause gunfire from snipers to ricochet back to them. <br/>Smoke - Drops a smoke bomb on the nearest turret, making it harder for that sniper to see. <br/>Turret Upgrade - Can be earned from either a sniper or a driver, this power-up upgrades all sniper turrets for the team who gets it. It is not available in single-player driving mode. <br/>Turret Downgrade - Like the Turret Upgrade, but causes all teams' turrets to be downgraded except for the team that collects it.

The days of easy drilling are long gone and oil companies are searching in ever deeper, riskier and more fragile places just to secure our daily fixx of capitalist cog-grease. The battle is on to protect these areas from the next 'Deepwater Horizon' and with a couple of dice, a few coins and a friend, you can re-enact this struggle. It's Greenpeace vs. the Oil Company, trying to establish marine reserves in the very territory the other player wants to exploit. Through a mix of strategic lobbying, exploration, occupation and reserve creation, one of you will triumph. But beware: too many blowouts and you'll have a deepwater slaughter on your hands. And if all the animals die, you both lose!<br/><br/><br/>You only need some coins and 2 dice to play. Everything else is included in the files. Game play takes place on a grided map of the ocean, containing squares of varying depths of water. One player takes on the role of environmental activists, Greenpeace, while the other, the role of a Big Nasty Oil company. Greenpeace is trying to establish marine reserves in the very places that Big Oil is trying to drill. You see, oil (in the form of coins) is available everywhere, but severely limited in shallow and medium depths. So once the easy oil runs out, the oil company is pushed into deep water. Drilling involves rolling two dice, one after the other. If the second number is larger than the first, this drill results in profit (coins equal to the difference in the two numbers) but if you roll a double, it's a blow out. Blow outs are more damaging in deeper water and any blow out might affect surrounding wildlife (animal counters are distributed randomly for each game). If any one species gets totally wiped out, both players lose.<br/><br/>Each player has 3 strategies to choose from each turn and there is enough variation to ensure that no single outcome is guaranteed (although a lot of animals consistently die).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Print and play version"], "name": "Deepsea Desperation", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Area Enclosure", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling"], "average": "4.33333", "usersrated": "3", "age": "8", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["114 - Deep Sea Desperation"]}, "88829": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kelley Callery"], "poll": [], "name": "Jingle Jangle", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Dominoes", "Holidays: Christmas"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic838268_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "Overnight Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic838268.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Print & Play"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Designed for the 2010 Christmas Print and Play Game Design Contest, Jingle Jangle is a domino-like placement game which scores points for arranging tiles into the appropriate patterns.<br/><br/>Jingle Jangle uses a special set of 30 tiles with two bells on them called jangles. The game can be played by two, three or four players and the size of the hand varies with the number of players.<br/>&bull; Two players get 14 jangles each, with two jangles left over.<br/>&bull; Three players get 9 jangles each, with three jangles left over.<br/>&bull; Four players get 7 jangles each, with two jangles left over.<br/>In the case of three left over jangles, one is put away out of the game and not exposed, to leave two jangles in the starter. The starter is the pair of left over jangles. These are turned face up and put side by side to make a square in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>Jangles are placed on the table, vertically or horizontally, played out from the starter square. The idea is to build a &ldquo;crossword puzzle&rdquo; grid of repeated color patterns in the rows and columns.<br/><br/>Any set of two or more adjacent jangles ending in a row or column is called a group. The jangles must be played so that the bells in each group form a (repeating) pattern. The possible patterns are:<br/><br/>&bull; a single color repeated, example: red, red, red or<br/>&bull; two colors alternating, example: red, blue, red, blue, red, blue or<br/>&bull; three colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow or<br/>&bull; four colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, green, red, blue, yellow, green or<br/>&bull; or all five colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, green, purple, red, blue, yellow, green, purple<br/>As soon as a group has a repeated color in it, or contains all five colors, the pattern for that group is fixed, and future jangles that extend the group must conform to the established pattern. As the layout grows, it is possible for a row or column to contain two or more groups, separated by spaces.<br/><br/>Each jangle must be placed so that it correctly extends two or more groups, but you are not allowed to create a set of four jangles side by side in the layout, touching along their long sides.<br/><br/>If a player thinks he cannot play, he exposes his hand. The other players can then (if they wish) point out any plays he might not have seen. In this case the player must play a tile. If more than one possible play is pointed out, the player has the option of picking the one he likes. If no play is pointed out, then the player scores zero and places no jangle. He is not out of the game, but has to wait for his next turn to see if he can then find a play.<br/><br/>The game ends one of two ways: 1) When one player places all his jangles. The other players who started after him get to place one more jangle, however. 2) When no player can place a jangle.<br/><br/>Scores are counted and added as the jangles are placed. Each bell on a jangle is worth 5 points, The score is the product of the new lengths of all extended groups. If the jangle used to extend the group is a double, then the score is also doubled.<br/><br/>All players lose points for the jangles remaining in their hands when the game is ended. Doubles are -5 points and all other jangles are -25 points.<br/><br/>"}, "88830": {"poll": [], "name": "Raid Over Moscow", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Atari 8-bit edition", "English/European Commodore 64 edition", "English/European ZX Spectrum edition", "UK ZX Spectrum edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1217338.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Alternate Historical", "Government / Politics"], "usersrated": "7", "videogamedeveloper": ["Access Software", "Sculptured Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC", "Apple II", "Atari 8-bit family", "BBC Micro", "Commodore 64", "ZX Spectrum"], "average": "6.42857", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Access Software", "Mastertronic", "Sculptured Software", "U.S. Gold Ltd"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1217338_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Is a Commodore 64 action game which depicts slightly changed version of history.<br/><br/>Plot starts with USSR attacking USA during the Cold War period.

Your goal is to occupy as large an area as possible on the game board using the blocks that you receive as rewards for making accurate guesses.

Questions belong to three categories: Market, Technology and Brainteaser.<br/><br/>Playing the Game <br/>Each round starts with the question category being determined by a roll of the die.<br/><br/>One of the players reads the question aloud and when all players understand the question, the timer is started and all players have 90 seconds to make educated guesses and estimate as good a guess as possible. The players&rsquo; answers must be recorded in the block before the 90 seconds is out.<br/><br/>0, 1, 2 or 3 points then are distributed<br/><br/>The players put their points out on the board according to the rules below. The player with the least number of playing squares covered with points places theirs first, followed by the player with the second smallest number of covered playing squares, and so on.

The two separate battles shown in this game are named for the main objective city on each map, Mozhaysk to the west of Moscow, and Mtsensk to the south. Perhaps the most dramatic of the many desperate battles fought in front of Moscow, these two battles combined all the elements of the great struggle. The Germans have an excellent fighting machine but are short on fuel and time. They must capture their objectives on a tight schedule or snow and mud will end their offensive. The Soviets are down to the rearward remnants of their once immense armies. If the Soviets can avoid being encircled by the fast moving German forces, high quality reinforcements from the Far East may finally allow them to stop the German advance.<br/><br/>Historically, the Soviets stood fast at Mozhaysk, fighting heavily even on the old Napoleonic battlefield of Borodino. Like Napoleon, the Germans eventually took the field, but at great cost in time and manpower. Near Mtsensk Guderian&rsquo;s Panzer spearhead advancing north from Orel was ambushed by the Soviets thereby disrupting the German timetable. This gave the Soviet 6th Guards Rifle Division time to dig-in on the heights above Mtsensk thereby barring the way to Tula and Moscow.<br/> Roads to Moscow uses the same mechanics found in the acclaimed Roads to Leningrad game, featuring a chit draw for activation of formations. Both players quickly learn how to use their motorized units effectively for overruns, combined arms, and movement of reserves.

The brave men who ventured into that place to perform the burial have spoken of how they could sense the spirit of the Baron still watching them somehow.  They had hoped to entomb his evil along with his mortal remains, but they had failed.

(For example the Mild Cheddar has the greatest number of pieces.) The goal of the game is to win by capturing all wedges comprising one of your opponent's three categories of cheddar. A player will lose if they lose one of their categories. The game is played on a rhombus shaped game board made up of triangluar cells.

It creates a 1-volume resource allowing the players and game masters alike to create and run adventures and campaigns that will last for an entire lifetime. The game is supported by a vast array of adventures, and other resources that are produced by Frog God Games.<br/><br/>This is the game you played 20 years ago. It&rsquo;s true to the original style and philosophy that made the game great. No &ldquo;Spot Checks&rdquo; here. Simple, flexible rules that allow players and game masters alike to roll play and roleplay.  This stand-alone tome provides all the rules you need to play the game. Its easily transferable as a rules set for other retro-clone games as well as those old dusty modules you still have in the attic.<br/><br/>In 1974, Gary Gygax (1938-2008) and Dave Arneson (1947-2009) wrote the world&rsquo;s first fantasy role-playing game, a simple and very flexible set of rules that launched an entirely new genre of gaming. In the year 2000, Wizards of the Coast, Inc. (holder of the &ldquo;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&rdquo; trademark) released the &ldquo;Open Game License,&rdquo; which allows third parties, like us, to use various intellectual properties historically associated with the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game &ndash; although not the actual trademarked name itself, and with specific terms and restrictions.<br/><br/>This book is an unofficial, &ldquo;re-stated&rdquo; version of the original Gygax &amp; Arneson rules (0e), created using the Open Game License. This original game consisted of a boxed set of three booklets: Men &amp; Magic, Monsters &amp; Treasure, and The Underworld &amp; Wilderness Adventures. Four supplements were also written by Gary Gygax, Rob Kuntz and others between 1975 and 1977, containing options for expanding the game with new rules. Collectively, all those booklets are often referred to as &ldquo;0e,&rdquo; standing for &ldquo;zero edition,&rdquo; and we mention the &ldquo;Original Game&rdquo; from time to time in this book, as a reference point. Swords &amp; Wizardry re-describes selected rules from all seven of the Original Game booklets, taking some and leaving some. In general, Swords &amp; Wizardry adopts class, monster, and spell rules from all the supplements, but sticks to the simpler combat mechanics from the boxed set and the first supplement only. Tim Kask, the first editor of the Dragon Magazine(TM), the first employee of TSR, Inc., and the editor of Supplements 2-4 for Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons (TM), has more to say about that in the Foreword.<br/><br/>The Swords &amp; Wizardry rules are extremely short, compared to the multi-paged rule-libraries required to play most modern role-playing games. Yet this game contains within itself all the seeds and soul of mythic fantasy, the building blocks of vast complexity, the kindling of wonder. &ldquo;Edition Zero&rdquo; is so powerful because it&rsquo;s encapsulated in a small formula, like a genie kept imprisoned in the small compass of an unremarkable lamp. Take this framework, and then imagine the hell out of it!<br/><br/>"}, "89000": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Dungeon Set 1", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1111355.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "9", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fat Dragon Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["E-Z Tiles"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1111355_t.png", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>This product gives 26 segments of dungeon tiles to let you customize your dungeon.
