But using the ability comes with a risk of revealing clues to other players. Players have to weigh the risk and the benefit when playing a card.<br/><br/>When a player is sure they have enough clues, it's time for them to declare the codes. The player wins if they are correct. If another player says they have one of the declared numbers, the declaration fails. The declared player misses one turn, but they don't get eliminated, and at least they gain a clue that another player has one.

This allows you to build a deck to cater to your own style of play! The object of the game is to reduce the opposing Advent&rsquo;s morale to zero. This can be achieved by strategically using the cards in your hand to deploy, attack and dominate your opponent.<br/><br/>One goal with Advent Saga was to add elements that rewarded meaningful choices over just drawing powerful cards. With the creation of our 4x4 battleground, players would not only need to rely on strength and power, but would also need to discover and develop new strategies involving Battleground position, Range, areas of effect, and much more.<br/><br/>"}, "174533": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Godchild"], "statistics": [], "name": "Hell Gate", "rpgdesigner": ["Gemmon"], "rpgproducer": ["Gemmon"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2439711.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Seventh Edition PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Horror (Supernatural)", "Religion", "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Gemmon (publisher)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2439711_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>All have heard of the legend of Vault 304.

Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.<br/><br/>Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!<br/><br/>In Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter, The Earl of Lemongrab and his sour disposition take on the cool as a cucumber penguin, Gunter!

Of course, if he wants to get rid of the tokens he will need a lot of cards in hand. Blue Plains is still the king of card draw. Blue Plains is also the best at moving Creatures between Landscapes. You will find that ability very useful with Frozen tokens hanging around! You will also find some very powerful Blue Plains Creatures that must move each turn, or suffer the consequences.<br/><br/>Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box.

It is a world of darkness and despair, where even the light of the One True God is often corrupted and twisted to serve sinister ends. As players, you may be heroes representing a bright point of light in the encroaching shadows of evil or you might just be survivors, living day by day however you can, survival your only goal. In Vathak, even joy is mingled with the bitter ashes of despair and hopelessness.<br/><br/>Silhouette of a Shadow is a 1st level adventure for 4-6 PCs. The module takes place in and around the city of Skalan, located in the Colonies region of Vathak. More information about Vathak can be found in the Shadows over Vathak Campaign Guide. Additionally, the Player\u2019s Guide to the Colonies and the Colonies- Game Master\u2019s Guide provide additional information about the Colonies to help bring the adventure and the region to life.

Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame dares you to preserve your stronghold sieged by orcs. You have traps &amp; weapons galore, and can team up with your friends to obliterate the nasty orcs and their grotesque allies.<br/><br/>Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame includes scores of figures of favorite heroes, plus hordes of orcs, crossbow orcs, kobolds, gnolls, trolls, ogres, and more. Build an exciting fortress using a tile-based system, then watch as swarms of baddies plunge through your defenses to abolish your Rift.<br/><br/>Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame  actually consists of TWO separate games! One is based on the heroic Order, while the other is for the Unchained. Both are complete stand-alone games. In Order, you&rsquo;ll play heroes such as Maximilian the War Mage, Gabriella the Redeemed Sorceress, and others, while fending off the villainous orc onslaught. In Unchained, you play opposing heroes, such as the Kobold King or Midnight the assassin, facing down assaults by human soldiers, lions, elves, bears, dwarfs, and the like.<br/><br/>How Is It Played?<br/>First, you and your friends choose your heroes &ndash; each individual game supports 1-4 players, who must co-operate to survive the enemy onslaught. Each hero has his own individual sheet, with his unique characteristics, special ability, and his secret superpower, that he needs to save for just the right moment. He also comes with his own special figure and his own weapon cards that no one else has access to.<br/><br/>When you think you are ready to go, choose a difficulty level, and a map &ndash; you can select one of the maps we&rsquo;ve included, or create one of your own! A typical map is made up of from 4 to as many as 13 tiles (or even more, if you are inventing your own design). The game has a lot of pieces to play with, but the map itself is reasonably tight, and will fit just fine on a typical gaming (or dining room) table.<br/><br/>Finally, the fight begins! Each turn, waves of orcs and other monsters move pitilessly through the map, relentlessly aiming for your poor Guardian, trying to destroy him and your Rift. You and your allies run around the map, placing traps in the various parts of your map, battling the invaders, and performing a host of other actions.<br/><br/>You earn trophy skulls for killing your enemies, and these act as the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;cash&rdquo; &ndash; spend them to buy new weapons, magic amulets, and a host of other items. You also can spend skulls to place traps, and to upgrade your Guardian, making him better-able to hold off the orcs, gnolls, and other enemies.<br/><br/>But over time your enemies accrue in strength, too! You have to face three Onslaughts, and with each Onslaught, your foes increase in might. If you do not lay a solid groundwork for your defenses with upgrades and trap placements in the early part of the game, you may face doom later on!<br/><br/>Combat is straightforward and fast &ndash; you roll various colored dice depending on what type of weapons and upgrades you own. Remove &ldquo;killed&rdquo; enemies from the map, only to see them replaced by new waves each turn. The fun continues. The game builds up over time to a crescendo of doom, in which the last few turns see you frantically try to finish off the final waves of the onslaught before your crippled Guardian is destroyed!<br/><br/>Head-to-head play?<br/>If you or your friends own both the Order and Unchained versions of Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame , you can go head-to-head, pitting the regimented Order against the legions of the Unchained in an epic conflict. You and your friends will split into two teams &ndash; one side fights for the Order, and the other will control the Unchained.<br/><br/>Each side has its own heroes, its own armies, its own Items, and its own traps. Your hero can defend your own citadel, or seek to lead your armies to victory inside the enemy lair. With friends to help, your faction can station heroes at both tasks, and even switch off duties.

Well, like evertything else here, this is a new experimentation on my behalf. I always hated how the format of the magazine changed for some games we published and it used to just greatly enlarge the size of the magazine. Another thing is that these games are mostly prototypes frequently being tested and updated, but Patreon still does not let us re-upload files. So I decided to keep the games in an environment that I can edit and change the files so you'll always have access to the latest version available.<br/><br/>But I had this idea just 5 seconds ago, so give me a little time to crop all the games into independent files.

Games take anywhere from 15 - 45 minutes, depending on how many people are playing. The game works on a system of sharing decks. I.e., instead of everyone bringing separate decks, there are three decks in each copy of the game from which every player draws. Specifically, Cards: The Attackening! consists of an Attackener deck (characters); Arsenal deck (Pets, Weapons, Armor, Evasions, and miscellaneous Items); and Twists of Fate (scenarios that affect gameplay - e.g., SciFi Attackeners gain a certain advantage while attacking.).<br/><br/>The game is played by every player drawing three Attackeners, three Arsenal cards, playing their first Attackener and then rolling to see who draws and plays the first Twist of Fate. The player with the highest roll chooses three Twists of Fate, and choosing the one that benefits them the most. That player then draws one Arsenal card, plays one, and attacks an opponent by rolling a die. Damage is determined by the amount rolled (1 is a miss, 2 is half damage, 3-5 is full, and 6 is double). If the opponent does not evade the attack, they take the damage and the move is passed to the next player, who follows the above steps to complete their turn.<br/><br/>When an Attackener's health is depleted, the person who beat that Attackener collects the card as a trophy. The person who was beaten chooses the next Twist of Fate, but does not play their next Attackener until it is their turn to play. This gives them a few rounds of immunity while play continues.

A frantic game, set amongst the ruins of a neglected and scorched earth. Engage in desperate battles between post-humans, hideous monstrosities and killer robots over the dregs of an age of gluttony. Take control of you own syndicate and test your metal against the weird and terrifying denizens of the wastes!<br/><br/>Wasteman is a fun, easy to learn, and refreshingly crazy game! Players or 'comrades' control syndicates, typically comprised of between 5 and 20 ruthless denizens of the wastes, in an attempt to vanquish their opponent, survive bizarre encounters and/or capture much needed supplies.<br/><br/>During a game of Wasteman, comrades take it turn to activate individual figures to perform several actions; such as attacking, moving, hiding or even bringing people back to life with the power of their mind in some cases! Figures can normally only be activated once per turn so you have real scope for strategy &ndash; goad your opponent into activating the wrong figure at the wrong time and they could be left open to all sorts of cunning shenanigans!<br/><br/>Once a syndicate drops below 5 figures they become desperate and the restriction for activating a figure only once in a turn is lifted. This leads to some really cinematic moments, where often lone survivors hopelessly attempt to fend off hordes of enemies and occasionally succeed! This really keeps the game fun right until the last man.<br/><br/>Figures take different kinds of damage &ndash; they can be spooked, crippled, seriously injured, or killed outright. To make it easier to remember what&rsquo;s happened, each figure comes with a base equipped with slots and removable tokens. These are cast in high quality resin and are included with all but the largest figures. Each figure will receive 1 base out of 10 designs selected at random.<br/><br/>M.A.D cards really bring the crazy to the game! Each comrade receives a hand of 5 M.A.D cards that can be played at any time (for the most part) to either help yourself or hinder your opponent. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like having the enemy boss abducted by aliens just before riding a conveniently timed tornado to the objective on the last turn! Though normally limited to 5 cards, you can seek the aid of traders or vending machines to top up your hand during a game leading to some very tense moment as your prize fighter sits in the middle of the battlefield kicking a coffee machine.<br/><br/>The cards themselves are lavishly illustrated by yours truly, and beautifully printed on quality playing card stock.<br/><br/>As well as a myriad of rules for hazards, mods to alter the game and a stockpile of scenarios, Wasteman has an in depth syndicate creation system, with loads of equipment, skills and Boss Rosters to choose from. Although each figure comes with a stat card, you are more than welcome to create your own and/or combine figures from different posse packs &ndash; the choices are vast!<br/><br/>Wasteman miniatures are sculpted by hand to approximately 35mm scale and will be cast in metal, unless specified to the contrary. All figures will come with stat cards and token slot bases. They will be supplied unpainted and, in some cases, unassembled.<br/><br/>"}, "174638": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["The Murder of Mr. Crow"], "poll": [], "name": "The Murder of Mr. Crow", "rpgdesigner": ["Rickard Elima\u0308a"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2446312.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "10", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Animal (Anthropomorphic)", "Crime (Mystery / Detective / Noir)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["Two-Page Tabletop Competition"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2446312_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>A game in which a group of friends will create a murder scenario together by taking turns playing the detective and the suspects they create.<br/><br/>"}, "174639": {"rpgartist": ["Florian de Gesincourt", "Tommaso Galmacci", "Richard Spake"], "rpgitemversion": ["Electronic Version"], "poll": [], "name": "BioMet Infection", "rpgdesigner": ["Davide Pignedoli"], "rpgproducer": ["Davide Pignedoli"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2505601.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["BioMet Infection"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Daimon Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2505601_t.png", "description": "from the designer<br/><br/>This is the electronic release of the BioMet Infection RPG.<br/><br/>In a few pages, the game contains the background setting, in classic cyberpunk style, the adventure seed, the characters' sheets to play with, and the instruction for the Master.

Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame dares you to preserve your stronghold sieged by orcs. You have traps &amp; weapons galore, and can team up with your friends to obliterate the nasty orcs and their grotesque allies.<br/><br/>Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame includes scores of figures of favorite heroes, plus hordes of orcs, crossbow orcs, kobolds, gnolls, trolls, ogres, and more. Build an exciting fortress using a tile-based system, then watch as swarms of baddies plunge through your defenses to abolish your Rift.<br/><br/>Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame  actually consists of TWO separate games! One is based on the heroic Order, while the other is for the Unchained. Both are complete stand-alone games. In Order, you&rsquo;ll play heroes such as Maximilian the War Mage, Gabriella the Redeemed Sorceress, and others, while fending off the villainous orc onslaught. In Unchained, you play opposing heroes, such as the Kobold King or Midnight the assassin, facing down assaults by human soldiers, lions, elves, bears, dwarfs, and the like.<br/><br/>How Is It Played?<br/>First, you and your friends choose your heroes &ndash; each individual game supports 1-4 players, who must co-operate to survive the enemy onslaught. Each hero has his own individual sheet, with his unique characteristics, special ability, and his secret superpower, that he needs to save for just the right moment. He also comes with his own special figure and his own weapon cards that no one else has access to.<br/><br/>When you think you are ready to go, choose a difficulty level, and a map &ndash; you can select one of the maps we&rsquo;ve included, or create one of your own! A typical map is made up of from 4 to as many as 13 tiles (or even more, if you are inventing your own design). The game has a lot of pieces to play with, but the map itself is reasonably tight, and will fit just fine on a typical gaming (or dining room) table.<br/><br/>Finally, the fight begins! Each turn, waves of orcs and other monsters move pitilessly through the map, relentlessly aiming for your poor Guardian, trying to destroy him and your Rift. You and your allies run around the map, placing traps in the various parts of your map, battling the invaders, and performing a host of other actions.<br/><br/>You earn trophy skulls for killing your enemies, and these act as the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;cash&rdquo; &ndash; spend them to buy new weapons, magic amulets, and a host of other items. You also can spend skulls to place traps, and to upgrade your Guardian, making him better-able to hold off the orcs, gnolls, and other enemies.<br/><br/>But over time your enemies accrue in strength, too! You have to face three Onslaughts, and with each Onslaught, your foes increase in might. If you do not lay a solid groundwork for your defenses with upgrades and trap placements in the early part of the game, you may face doom later on!<br/><br/>Combat is straightforward and fast &ndash; you roll various colored dice depending on what type of weapons and upgrades you own. Remove &ldquo;killed&rdquo; enemies from the map, only to see them replaced by new waves each turn. The fun continues.

The elite needed a new pastime.<br/><br/>Fortunately for them, a new class of mass-spectacle gladiators was found. Questionable lab projects involving human-cloning, attempting to solve the world&rsquo;s worst diseases, created a global zombie pandemic.  Luckily, the crisis was put down quickly &ndash; but the lab-created undead still existed.<br/><br/>Someone with a bit of redneck, and way too much time, picked up a few up zombie &ldquo;assets&rdquo; at a company bankruptcy liquidation. After a little tinkering, he managed to build a control collar contraption. When a zombie was outfitted with a collar, a skillful operator could, sort-of, get the zombies to walk in a straight line.  Conveniently, the undead had no legal rights, which made them the perfect attraction.<br/><br/>A viral video and a crowd-sourced funding campaign later, these not-so-intelligent shamblers were being billed as the latest thing in racing spectacles.  Wealthy backers quickly formed teams, a league and championship cup was created, and the wealthy few who could afford the labs, zombie jockeys, and all that related to it now had a new prestigious exclusive club.<br/><br/>As with all good clubs, betting became part of the social fun.

They pit their zombie against the other zombies, in a series of 3 races, out of an arena where armed Hunters and helpless Victims prowl. Zombies move in a semi-controlled fashion based on dice rolls. The arena has 6 finish lines spaced equally around the outside edge. The first zombie to cross a finish line is first, and earns points for it's owner AND anyone who bet on it. The second zombie to cross gets second, and the third zombie gets third. After the third zombie crossed a line, the crowd gets bored, and all remaining zombies are shot and killed.<br/><br/>During a race, players place bets on any of the racing zombies, including their own. If a players zombie is not performing well, that player can place a bet on another player's zombie who is performing better, and may be able to help that zombie finish better in the race.<br/><br/>At the end of 3 races, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>"}, "174662": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2446224.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Daniel Deming"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "13", "boardgamepublisher": ["No Spoon Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2446224_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Card Game", "Dice", "Mythology"], "description": "The year is 596 A.D. and the Gregorian Mission has decreed a conversion of all pagans to Christianity.

There's not any hardcore scenes present in the game, but Marc might catch Emmanuelle disrobing while looking through a certain keyhole, although more often he will see only an old gentleman washing his feet.<br/><br/>"}, "174685": {"poll": [], "name": "The Great Dreidel Race!", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2748393_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Education Incorporated"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2748393.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Religious"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The Great Dreidel Race is a roll-and-move game contained in The Great Big Box of Hanukkah Fun.

When the program was instituted in 1953, &lsquo;controlling' mutants meant extermination, and for generations of America mutants, the grimly iconic &quot;Watchmen&quot; mecha have been harbingers of death. Project Watchtower predates the creation of Psi-Watch by several years, and the two government agencies have worked at cross purposes at several points. Project Watchtower has the brainchild of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover- plans for the program date back to the late 1940s, but Hoover lacked the funding and technological know-how to initiate the black program until decades later.<br/><br/>The first Watchman mecha came on line in 1962. Prior to that, the agency used well armed, FBI-trained mutant hunters to capture or kill mutants. As to be expected, casualties were high, as the hunted mutants fought hard for their lives, slaughtering dozens of FBI-affiliated hunters. Hoover's towering mechanical warriors were a welcome substitute, and quickly became the most potent weapon in the pure-human arsenal. Upgraded dozens of times over the years, the Watchman series of mecha have included several similar units of gigantic mutant hunters, as well as smaller, more efficient experimental models.<br/><br/>Psi-Watch itself opposed Project Watchtower since its inception, arguing that Mutants make excellent operatives and that hunting the species en masse only breeds more Mutant terrorists. Despite Psi-Watch's objection, and despite several black operations against Project Watchtower itself, Hoover was able to keep his robotic army in service. By the late 1960s, the large scale Mutant purges of the intolerant 1950s had ended, and Watchman robots were only publically deployed to combat Mutant riots in the inner cities. Well connected, ultra-wealthy Mutant hunters (especially the close friends of Hoover) occasionally &lsquo;rented' a Watchman mecha as a bodyguard of sorts when they ventured into America's ghettos to slaughter the genetically unfashionable.<br/><br/>Project Watchtower was officially ended by Jimmy Carter in 1979, but by that time its technology had fallen into the hands of various interests. The Republic of Cebary fields advanced versions of Project Watchtower's creations, using them to police its enormous slave-Mutant population. The technology has made its way into the open market, becoming almost obsequious. China uses modified Watchmen mecha to maintain internal security, Al Queda uses jury-rigged versions of the robots to carry out terror strikes, while Humanity's Sweat uses the massive war machines for their original purpose: the eradication of the Mutant threat, wherever it may hide.<br/><br/>This sixteen page sourcebook for the Psi-Watch Campaign setting details Watchtower Mecah units, rules for them gaining sentience, as well as Bio-Guardians and an alternat timeline that introduces Grendel Generation Technology.<br/><br/>"}, "174782": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2723199.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Chad Brown", "Tanis O'Connor", "Paul Peterson", "Mike Selinker", "Liz Spain", "Gaby Weidling"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["Paizo Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2723199_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "description": "The Wrath of the Righteous campaign continues with the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: The Midnight Isles Adventure Deck.

Though it took more than a decade, and more than 3 billion dollars redirected from the SDI budget, Project: Genehound succeeded beyond anyone&rsquo;s wildest imagination.<br/><br/>"}, "174790": {"rpgdesigner": ["Christopher A.

I love my job.&rdquo;<br/>- Personal datastacks: Ariel Atlanta,Puzzle Ops executive cadre. January 9, 2014<br/><br/>The Cityborn are the next evolution of humanity- homo sapiens urbis- a creature uniquely adapted for life in cities. The Cityborn are a reaction to an increasingly polluted and industrialized world, an adaptive, post-human species designed to thrive on crowds, chaos and noise, who breathe diesel fumes and bleed liquid silicon. The first Cityborn were recorded during the early 1950s, their evolution likely sparked by the first atomic tests.<br/><br/>The Cityborn are a variant strain of humanity, a natural mutagenic response to an increasingly mechanized and urbanized planet. The first Cityborn mutates emerged during the late 1950s, oddities that quickly became an accepted, if disturbing part of life in mega-cities like London and Tokyo. Over the years, Cityborn births have occurred around the globe, with a massive concentration of these strange mutants emerging in overcrowded, heavily polluted India.<br/><br/>These Cityborn children are the first citizens of a coming Earth where there is nothing but city, where industrialization and urban sprawl have claimed every corner of the globe. When Cityborn sleep, they dream of a fully mechanized planet, a chrome, glass and steel construct sheathing Earth. Among themselves, the post-humans refer it to simply as The City, and none of the cities of the modern, disconnected Earth can match the efficient majesty of The City itself. Cityborn consider themselves both harbingers and engineers of The City- their actions bring The City out of the blue prints encoded in their genes and into the present.<br/><br/>Cityborn mutates have found their ways into the world&rsquo;s intelligence community and criminal underworlds, blending their natural gift for stealth and survival with an unmatched knowledge of the cities they are genetically bonded to.<br/><br/>Psi-Watch has recruited hundreds of Cityborn mutates as urban operatives, and after the Patriot Ivories, Cityborn make the up the largest percentage of Psi-Watch meta-humans. Puzzle Ops and other intelligence services have also seen the value in these urban hunters. Cityborn operatives can be found at almost every Puzzle Ops station house or field office around the globe. By fighting global superhuman terror, Cityborn agents ensure the smooth construction of The City, ensuring that when a Cityborn fights, it is with unrelenting passion.<br/><br/>"}, "174792": {"rpgdesigner": ["Christopher A.

The Neuralon are willowy, curiously seductive, non-human, bipedal pleasure-lovers. The Neuralon reputation within the Imperium is based around their medical knowledge, particularly in the area of analgesia, anaesthetics and in the treatment and management of both acute and chronic pain, and in luxury technological items of all sorts.<br/><br/>This peaceful race has evolved to be highly sensitive to those around them, using that sensitivity to create and broadcast pacifying pheromones and adjusting their own body language and vocal range to tones and flexions that quickly calm and pacify the aggressors. This automatic, uncontrollable pursuit of appeasing and pacifying aggressors through virtually undetectable means leads to a lifestyle that is monopolised by sensory seduction.<br/><br/>Their home planet, Neuralos, is a holiday destination for the extremely rich and powerful or for the decadent pleasure-seekers. The pleasures they can provide, from food, clothing, drinks, beds, entertainment or mere pampering cannot be matched. Oddly, (to an offworlder, that is) the seedier forms of entertainment do not exist outside startown. The Neuralon find it emotionally upsetting to see the degradation of enforced slavery or prostitution. What is more useful to offworlders  is that the Neuralon medical capabilities, growing from their natural urge to appease and aid those they meet, exceed all expectations, and are on the cutting edge of technological advancement.<br/><br/>As a species and society, their strength is also a drawback. They do not build armed warships and are completely reliant on the Imperium and hired mercenaries for their defence: the very thought of inflicting pain on another sapient creature causes them severe distress, triggering their own, reactive-defence measures. As a result, when making their way in the galaxy, they either take jobs as medics or as entertainers, or sometimes as advocates, as many other jobs involve too much pain. There can never be a Neuralon empire or conquered world; but for the same reasons they cannot force their will on another, others find it difficult to force their will on the Neuralon.<br/><br/>Learn more about this race, their homeworld and some of their advanced technology in this eleven page PDF.<br/><br/>"}, "174794": {"rpgdesigner": ["Tim Bancroft"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Minor Races: The Arient", "rpgartist": ["Jason Rhodes"], "rpgproducer": ["Christopher A.

The key to this frustration is one of Arient arrogance: the superior psions regard the Zhodani as too impure as a whole strata of Zhodani society lacks any psionic capability at all and their culture promotes the use of Psionics in their daily life, thus damaging its purity and the achievement of celestial openness.

In a last-ditch effort to save it, Hara's stewards send a call throughout the universe, drawing on Champions &mdash; individuals capable of containing this energy &mdash; and offering the promise of untold glory. However, only one Champion can bring the world of Hara back into balance and earn its power for themself.<br/><br/>In Champions of Hara, you take control of one such individual. Journey across the shifting planes of Hara, forging fragile alliances, battling epic monsters, and facing off against friends and foes alike. As you do, you unlock new powers and abilities to help you on your journey. But beware because as the Conflux grows more intense, the monsters you face get tougher, the world gets harsher, and the planes that make up Hara itself shift. Do you have what it takes to stand up to the challenge?<br/><br/>In more detail, your mission is to contain Hara's three wayward energies. To do so, you must defeat monsters, close rifts, and explore the six shifting planes of Hara. As you do, you're rewarded with energy cubes which you can use to unlock the three Elemental Attunements and gain new powers and abilities. Along the way, you have to manage your hand, actions, and a unique Energy Alignment system to get the most out of every turn and take on the toughest challenges. If you can, you'll be well on your way to containing all three elemental energies and winning the game!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "0", "name": "Champions of Hara", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Hand Management"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["176072"], "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["TRCP Launch Episode 7", "Vox Republica 094: The CR At Gen Con 2015 - Part 1"]}, "174806": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jean Balczesak", "Denis Beck", "Didier Guiserix", "Pierre Lejoyeux", "Tristan Lhomme", "Pierre Rosenthal", "Frank Stora", "Piotr Tcherepkine"], "statistics": [], "name": "Casus Belli (Special Issue 1 - 1988)", "rpgartist": ["Rolland Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Blanchard", "Philippe \"Caza\" Cazaumayou", "Yves Corriger", "Marcel Coucho", "Didier Guiserix", "Andr\u00e9 Juillard", "Eric Larnoy", "Thierry S\u00e9gur", "Olivier Vatine"], "rpgproducer": ["Christophe Bouillet", "Didier Guiserix", "Agn\u00e8s Pernelle", "Pierre Rosenthal", "Val\u00e9rie Tourre"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic532563.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Casus Belli"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Casus Belli pr\u00e9sent SimulacreS", "Comment adapter les sc\u00e9narios de CB", "Cr\u00e9er ses propres sc\u00e9narios en huit le\u00e7ons", "Cr\u00e9ez vos propres r\u00e8gles", "Dossier \"vampire\"", "En cours de partie", "Et les autres jeux de r\u00f4le?", "L'Arme Secr\u00e8te", "L'esprit d'Octobre", "L'horreur du fond des mers", "L'or de Balak", "La magie dans les syst\u00e8me de SimulacreS", "A la poursuite...", "La relique", "Le Nid des espions", "Les abominables", "Les grands espaces", "Qu'est-ce que le jeu de r\u00f4le?", "R\u00e8gles compl\u00e9mentaires pour aller plus loin", "R\u00e8gles du jeu", "A travers l'histoire", "Un Monde magique", "Un univers impitoyable", "Une plan\u00e8te r\u00eav\u00e9e"], "rpg": ["SimulacreS"], "rpgpublisher": ["Excelsior Publications"], "rpgissueversion": ["Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic532563_t.jpg", "description": "User summary<br/><br/>Casus Belli special issue 1 presents SimulacreS, a complete generic roleplaying game with a lite rule system and 7 settings ready to play.<br/><br/><br/>     Fantasy<br/>     Adventure<br/>     Horror<br/>     Space Opera<br/>     History<br/>     TV series<br/>     Spy<br/><br/><br/>Each setting come with background, an adventure and pre-made PCs.<br/><br/>This is the 5th Edition of the rules.<br/><br/>This issue also includes extra resource to write your own adventure, design new rules, etc.<br/><br/>"}, "174808": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Andrew S.

This requires a great deal of energy, and in a final ironic twist, the only source of such great energy is the dying star itself. In the process of extracting and transmitting the energy required to save themselves, they will be compounding the instability of the Sun and hastening the end of their worlds.<br/><br/>Sol:  Last Days of a Star is a board game for two to five players where each player represents a different planetary effort to transmit as much energy from the Sun back to their Ark as they can to escape the solar system before the Sun explodes!<br/><br/>The board represents the solar environment: two layers of orbit around the Sun (Upper and Lower Orbit), and three layers within the Sun itself (the Convective, Radiative, and Core).  The deeper you go, the higher your rewards, but the faster the instability of the Sun is increased.  Your Mothership rotates slowly in orbit around the Sun, and this is the only place your ships can launch from to perform useful tasks in the solar environment. You can either convert ships into stations or use the ships to activate yours and other players' stations. If you activate your own stations you get the full reward, while activating other player's stations you split the reward with the owner. You gain energy by activating Harvest stations, and you use this energy to either activate Build stations to build new ships (which you need since you are constantly losing ships by converting them into new stations) or activate Transmit stations to transmit the energy back to your Ark to turn into Momentum (which is ultimately how your Ark will escape). But you cannot enter the Sun without converting ships into solar Bridges which span the high energy membranes separating one layer from the next.<br/><br/>You must carefully manage your time and resources in order to transmit the most energy back to your Ark before the Sun is lost forever.   With any luck, some small collection of your last planetary residents will escape the solar system before it is engulfed by the oncoming supernova!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "Sol:  Last Days of a Star", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Pattern Building", "Route/Network Building"], "average": "8.02273", "usersrated": "44", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 019 \u2013 10 Reasons to Buy a Game", "Ep 016 \u2013 BGG Con 2015 Recap Extravaganza!!"]}, "174838": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Micha\u0142 Oracz", "Ignacy Trzewiczek"], "poll": [], "name": "Neuroshima Tactics: The Outpost \u2013 Assault Troopers II", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2012", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Neuroshima"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2448013_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Portal Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2448013.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Neuroshima Tactics: The Outpost - Assault Troopers II"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "30 years ago...civilization as we know it was blasted to smithereens.

In TROLL, each player takes the role of a thief, trying to steal precious jewels from the hideous troll.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player receives a set of six tokens, with numbers from 0 to 5. Depending the number of the players, some troll cards are not used (Troll cards have values 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15). On a round, players attempt to steal from the target troll by playing his or her tokens in sequence. The first player secretly looks at the target troll (the top troll card) and plays one of his number tokens face up. If he or she plays a &quot;3&quot; token, it means that the player intends to steal 3 jewels from the target troll. Next players have two options: 1) look at the troll card just as the first player did and play a number token face up; or 2) play a number token face down, take a multiplier (x2) token from the pool, and put the multiplier token on his or her face down number token.<br/><br/>After all the players played their number tokens, the troll card is revealed. Beginning from the player who played the lowest card, add up the value of the number tokens. Suppose that the troll is &quot;9&quot; and Amy played &quot;3&quot;, Becky &quot;5&quot;, Carlos &quot;2&quot;, and Dave &quot;3&quot; with &quot;x2&quot; multiplier on it, Carlos (2), Amy (3), and Dave (3) are entitled to receive 2, 3, and 6 (3x2) jewels respectively. However, Becky will receive a penalty point (-2), since she woke up the troll. 9 is bigger than 2+3+3 but it is smaller than 2+3+3+5. Becky triggered the troll's rampage.<br/><br/>Play continues in this manner for a specified number of rounds/days (set of rounds), depending the number of the players.

The game can be played by 2-10 players. Each player is dealt 5 cards, the winner of the game is either: The first player to hold 10 cards, or if one player loses all their cards the player who, at that point, holds the most cards. Cards are gained or lost among players or from a central pile. A Game indicator card with the titles of 11 games is passed around the players the holder of this card being the &quot;lead player&quot; in each of the 11 rounds thus making each round of play random, and different. The prime purpose of the game is to become familiar with the elements, players with more familiarity will stand a higher chance of winning.<br/><br/>The rounds listed on the Periodyx Game Indicator Card are:<br/><br/>1) Atomic Power!<br/>The lead player asks ONE OTHER player to choose a card in their hand and to read out loud that element&rsquo;s name (do not show the card). The lead player then chooses a card from their own hand, and reads out loud the element&rsquo;s name. Both cards are now compared. The player whose card has the HIGHER Atomic Number wins, takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>2) A-2-Z!<br/>The new lead player picks any letter of the alphabet and then asks ONE player of their choice if they have an element beginning with the letter they have named. If the asked player DOES have an element that begins with the letter the lead player asked for, they must give the lead player the card (or cards if they have more than one that begins with the asked for letter). This ends the lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player. <br/>If the asked player DOES NOT have an element that begins with the letter, the lead player asked for, the ASKED player takes the top card from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; and adds it to the cards in their hand. <br/>This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>3) Hot Stuff!<br/>The new lead player asks ONE OTHER player to choose a card in their hand and to read out loud that element&rsquo;s name (do not show the card). The lead player then chooses a card from their own hand, and reads out loud the element&rsquo;s name. Both cards are now compared. The player whose card has the HIGHER boiling point wins, takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. <br/>This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>4) Hi-Lo!<br/>The new lead player takes any one card from their hand, and places it face up in front of them. From this card the lead player chooses ANY ONE of the stats from in the Stat Section (except the date stat) and predicts whether the next card turned over from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; will have a higher or a lower number in the same stat. Once the prediction is made, the top card from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; is turned over and the two cards are compared. <br/>If the lead player has predicted correctly, they take both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. If the lead player has predicted incorrectly, both cards are given to the player on their left. <br/>This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>5) Neutron Countdown!<br/>The lead player asks ONE OTHER player to choose a card in their hand, and to read out loud the name of the element (do not show the card). The lead player then chooses a card from their own hand, and reads out loud that element&rsquo;s name. Both cards are now compared. The player whose card has the HIGHER number of neutrons wins, takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. <br/>This ends this player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>6) Add-it!<br/>The lead player takes the top card from the &ldquo;draw pile,&rdquo; and adds it to the cards in their hand. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>7) Big Freeze!<br/>The new lead player asks ONE OTHER player to choose a card in their hand, and to read out loud that element&rsquo;s name (do not show the card). The lead player then chooses a card from their own hand, and reads out loud the element&rsquo;s name. Both cards are now compared. The player whose card has the LOWER melting point wins, takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>8) Element of Surprise!<br/>The lead player asks ONE OTHER player to hold out their cards fanned-out, facedown. The lead player then takes ANY ONE card from the asked player, and adds it to the cards in their hand. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player. <br/><br/>    SPECIAL NOTE: The lead player cannot take the LAST card from any player.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>9) Early Bird!<br/>The lead player takes ANY card from their hand, and places it face up in front of them. They then predict whether the next card turned over from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; will have an earlier or later date of discovery than their card. Once the prediction is made, the top card from the &ldquo;draw pile&rdquo; is turned over, and compared. If the lead player has predicted correctly, they take both cards and add them to the cards in their hand. If the lead player has predicted incorrectly, both cards are given to the player on their left. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>10) Match!<br/>The lead player takes ANY card from their hand, and places it face up in front of them. They then ask ONE OTHER player to do the same. <br/>Now ALL of the players play at the same time and try to be the first player to spot how the two cards match, or are the same in any way. Are they both metals? Both solids? Do both element names begin with the letter &lsquo;P&rsquo;, any similarity can be a correct match. The first player to spot the match keeps both the matched cards. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>11) Natural/Synthetic/Atomic<br/>The lead player takes ANY card from their hand, and places it facedown in front of them. They then ask ONE OTHER player to do the same. Both cards are turned over, face up at the same time. Check the Natural/Synthetic/Atomic symbols at the bottom of the cards: <br/>&bull;    Natural beats synthetic/atomic, <br/>&bull;    Natural/atomic beats natural <br/>&bull;    Synthetic/atomic beats natural/atomic. <br/>The winner takes both cards, and adds them to the cards in their hand. If it is a tie, both players keep their own cards. This ends this lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>The Mendeleev Card<br/>If on a player&rsquo;s turn (before taking their turn), they can place a card next to the Mendeleev Card so that the colored bars match (see example) they may play that card on the table and draw 2 cards from the &ldquo;draw pile.&rdquo; If there are 2 or more cards in play on the table (this begins to form the periodic table). Any cards that match any of the cards can be played in this manner, drawing two fresh cards for each card played.<br/>Winning!<br/><br/>Two ways to end the game:<br/><br/>1) The first player to collect TEN cards in their hand immediately stops and wins the game!<br/><br/>2) The first player to lose ALL the cards in their hand stops the game. The player who, when the game is stopped, has the highest number of cards in their hand is declared the winner. In the case of a tie, the player who has the card with the highest Atomic Number wins.<br/>Ties or N/A!<br/>If during any round of play the stats are tied, the round is void, this ends the lead player&rsquo;s turn, and play moves on to the next player, and the next game on the Periodyx Game Indicator Card.<br/><br/>If there is a N/A (not applicable) on a card, this round is void. Players have the option to keep a card with a N/A or to exchange it by returning it to the bottom of the draw pile and taking the top card from the draw pile.<br/><br/>There is an expansion book available with rules for 10 further games.<br/><br/>"}, "174969": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Nicholas Hjelmberg"], "average": "5.25", "poll": [], "name": "Explorers & Exploiters", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Memory", "Modular Board"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2454049_t.png", "boardgameartist": ["Nicholas Hjelmberg"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2454049.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["City Building", "Civilization", "Exploration"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "In Explorers &amp; Exploiters, you are one of several leaders over a people, exploring and exploiting the resources of a New World.

The first player to place all of them on the board is the winner.<br/><br/>The world is made up of tiles of different kinds - foundations for settlements, resources necessary for settlements, and useless wastelands. At the start, the world is terra incognita and all tiles are turned face down, waiting to be explored by the units.<br/><br/>The units in the world are of two kinds - explorers and barbarians. They do not belong to particular players but any player may act with them. Explorers may explore a tile (move to it and look at it privately) or exploit a tile (turn it face up and make it available for all players). Barbarians on the other hand plunder tiles and turn them face down again.<br/><br/>By turning tiles face up or face down, players may make more or less resources connected to settlements. This allows the settlement to be expanded or expelled and the player to replace the existing settlement with one from the hand.<br/><br/>The challenge of the game is to play the common units so that the right settlement can be played in the right place at the right time.<br/><br/>There are no such things as &rdquo;mine&rdquo; and &rdquo;yours&rdquo;, nor such things as &rdquo;good&rdquo; and &rdquo;evil&rdquo;.

In addition, every skill in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook also gets brand-new skill exploits, as well as greater exploits that only the most skilled masters would even attempt. This book contains rules for using these enhanced skills with mythic characters but also provides an alternative system for use in non-mythic Pathfinder campaigns!<br/><br/>This system allows your characters to focus on their skills as a key part of their character construction and to invest more of their character's abilities in their character itself, rather than the character&rsaquo;s gear or magical tools. You can use these rules generally with mythic characters, allowing them to attempt all manner of skill-based exploits, or you can limit the ability to pull off these amazing skill stunts to those mythic characters that have really invested in making their skills a key part of their character's identity. The mythic rules offer an opportunity to magnify what makes a character special, and the skills they choose to hone as part of their background narrative and throughout the course of the campaign should be just as important in defining them as their marvelous magic and fabulous feats.

It is a real-time game where players manipulate a personal area (with rules from the famous single-player game,  Solitaire) while competing with the others to play cards in a central area that give them points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>Each player starts with a standard, 52-card deck of playing cards.  The decks must all be of different designs (so that they can be sorted out at the end of the game for scoring purposes).  Then each player places 12 cards face-down in a pile on his left, with a 13th card face-up.  This is the player's stack.  Then deal one card (each) face-up into four different slots to the right of the stack.  These four slots, along with the stack, are the player's &quot;personal area.&quot;  In the middle of the table, it is important for there to be plenty of space between the personal areas for the shared area.  It starts with no cards in it.  The 35 cards remaining are the player's deck.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>When all players announce they are ready, all players start play simultaneously.  Each player constantly decides to do one of two things: manipulate their personal area, or sift through their deck.  In the personal area, players may move cards in the four piles according to Solitaire rules (i.e. a black 8 may be played on a red 9).  Cards from the stack may be moved onto any of the 4 piles, but cards may not be moved from the piles onto the stack.  Also, at any time that an Ace is in a player's personal area, he may move it to the shared area.  Also, any top cards (the top card in a series or the stack) may be played from the personal area to the shared area on top of a card that is one rank less than it of the same suit (i.e. a 2 of hearts may be played on an Ace of hearts).  Whenever playing in the shared area, players must only use one hand.<br/><br/>If a player has no moves he wishes to make in his personal area, he goes through his deck.  He holds his deck in one hand, with all cards face-down.  Then he plays two cards face-down in front of him and plays the third one face-up.  He then decides if he wants to play the third card anywhere in his four piles or in the shared area.  If he does not, he flips it face down (on top of the other face-down card) and then repeats (plays two more cards face-down and the third face-up).  When he gets to the end of his deck, he always flips the final card face-up, no matter if it was a first, second, or third.  He now picks up his deck again and repeats the process.  (Alternate rules for easy-mode: the player goes through his deck one at a time instead of only seeing every third card.)<br/><br/>Game End and Scoring:<br/><br/>The game ends when one player plays the final card from their stack and yells, &quot;out&quot;!  All other players count the number of cards remaining in their stack; they count as negative points against them.  Then players help to sort out all cards in the shared area by whose deck it was played from; these count as points for players.  If one player has reached 100 or more, the game is over and the player with the highest score declared the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "174994": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2554264.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Yann and Clem"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Alexandre Bonvalot"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Devil Pig Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2554264_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "An Achtung!
