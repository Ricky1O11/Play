The game system is based on the adventures during movement in a diversified terrain of old England. In the role of Knights the players have to search for the imprisoned Queen of England and return her to her beloved husband, the grieving King. An original game after an original novel.<br/><br/>In this game the game board is constructed from tiles (initially put face-down) and is revealed throughout the game as Knights move on the tiles. Each tile is divided into 9 segments which are used for the movement and there are 3 Terrain types to be found - Roads, Forests, and Mountains. Each Terrain allows for a different Movement speed.<br/><br/>The Goal of the Knights is to uncover and get to six Castles and find out on which of them the Queen is held (by secretly checking upon a castle card when they enter a Castle, eventually coming to the last card under a small stone, that shows the correct Castle). During their journeys they can use various helpers, for instance Horses, Boats, Eagles or their special versions (awarded from the King for capturing Traitors, that can be found in Taverns).<br/><br/>All-in-all the concept and production quality of the game is fresh and outstanding and is well worth the moderate-to-low price.<br/><br/>The game is language independent, only the manual would have to be translated (currently in Czech only, as of February 2009).<br/><br/>"}, "41002": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic495883.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"7640": {"name": "Paolo Mori"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"12592": "Mariano Iannelli"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"267": {"name": "999 Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic495883_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1008": {"name": "Nautical"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"20981": "2009 Jogo do Ano Nominee"}, "description": "Recruit workers, buy projects, build ships. And use the ships to open new commercial routes to eastern Africa and India, to earn money and glory.<br/><br/>This is a resource management game, with an element of risk management, that works like this:<br/><br/>Beginning with the start player, each player takes one numbered disc and places it on top of his own coloured disc in one of the four action areas of the board. A Vasco da Gama tile states a number; everything above this number is free of charge, anything below will have to be paid for, so players will take this into account when taking numbered discs. When all players have placed four discs, a modifier to this 'activation number' is shown, and discs are worked by number. In the crew area players may hire crew and a captain, but this costs money. Each round there is a window of ships. The number on the left is the navigation strength, the number on the right is the required amount of different crew. Players choose a ship, pay for the crew and turn the tile to its other side - with a captain on top. In the navigation area, a player takes his ship and places it in a row of his choice, but he has to take care not to exceed the navigation strength of the ship.<br/><br/>The game lasts five rounds, after which the player with the most points has won.<br/><br/>A brief description from the rule book:<br/><br/>Vasco da Gama was charged with finding a maritime route to India.<br/><br/>Players play the part of rich shipowners who, under his patronage, aim to achieve prestige and riches. <br/>To succeed in the enterprise, they must manage the money and actions at their disposal in order to hire captains, recruit crew, build ships, launch them, and send them to the landings of Natal, Terra de Boa Gente, Mozambique, Malindi, Mombasa, and Calicut.<br/><br/>For each ship sent, players will receive an immediate reward and will gain prestige (Victory Points). <br/>The farther the ship is sent, the lower the compensation, but the higher the victory score that the player will earn.<br/><br/>Ships at landings that are &quot;complete&quot; at the end of the round (i.e. reached by a certain number of Ships) will earn further Victory Points for their owners and will then advance, under certain conditions, to the next Landing. This creates the opportunity to earn again Victory Points in the following Rounds.<br/><br/>During each Round, Players take actions in various Areas (Navigation, Recruiting, or Purchase Projects or Characters).<br/>Planning is fundamental: The right to take an Action could be free of charge or paid for.<br/><br/>The earlier a Player plans to take an Action, the more likely that he will have to pay for it.<br/><br/>Players will have to ask themselves if and how much they are ready to pay for the right to act first in a certain area.<br/><br/>Vasco da Gama himself will decide which is the first free of charge Action for each Round. He will also help some of the Players by making some money available to them.<br/><br/>This great maritime enterprise raises the interest of 4 influential Characters.<br/>Aiming to have a substantial role in the development of the new commercial route, they will also provide their favors free of charge to the Players.<br/><br/>Francisco Alvares (The Priest) will make available a number of Missionaries to be used as crew members, Girolamo Sernigi (The Merchant) will organize Ships built and manned, Bartolomeu Dias (The Leader) will grant an increased initiative and additional Victory Points, and Manuel 1st (The King) will allow Players to take an additional Action in the name of the Portuguese Kingdom.<br/><br/>The winner is the Player with the highest Victory Points score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"21722": "999 Games Dutch first edition"}, "average": "7.30579", "name": "Vasco da Gama", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "3754", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"21622": "Colonial Theme"}}, "41003": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic446261.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2": {"name": "Reiner Knizia"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"11968": "Martin Hoffmann"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2366": {"name": "Devir"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic446261_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "description": "In this stand-alone small box &quot;travel version&quot; of Keltis the familiar rules and forms are mixed with some push-your-luck element.

Except for minor attacks, France and Great Britain, the victors of World War One, do nothing. The Allies view the short Polish campaign of 1939 as a case of a newer, larger army winning out over an older, smaller army. Certainly the massed panzers are impressive, and need to be emulated, but the winter months see little positive activity on the Allied side. Missing the more vital lessons of the Polish campaign, the Allies are content to wait. Not only do their armies outnumber the Germans in terms of manpower, tanks and artillery, they have the advantage of operating on the defensive. Meanwhile the Germans feverishly apply the lessons they learned in Poland, and hone their operational techniques. The surprise German conquest of Norway jolts the Allies out of their lethargy. They do not have long to wait for the next blow.<br/><br/>May 10th, 1940: Germany unleashes its Blitzkrieg upon the western Allies. Six weeks later, the war ends in a smashing German victory. Four Allied national armies have vanished. The tiny Dutch and Belgian armies, pulverized in battle, have surrendered. Great Britain rescues most of the soldiers in the BEF, but their heavy weapons and vehicles remain on the beaches of Dunkirk. The island nation begins to re-arm, but for now is out of the fight. The proud French Army, with many regiments tracing an unbroken lineage back to the 1600s, suffers the most catastrophic defeat of modern times before France surrenders.<br/><br/>How did this happen? The Germans, realizing they could not win a repeat of World War One, set about reinventing the offense. Their formula included massed tank formations, an air force dedicated to close tactical support, and most importantly, a command and control system based on the use of radios. Allied tanks and soldiers were often equal or superior to their German counterparts &ndash; when given the opportunity to properly deploy and prepare. Unfortunately, such opportunities were few and far between. The Germans had securely positioned themselves inside an Allied decision making process that often took days to execute, rapidly concentrating, overwhelming defenders and then exploiting success. Certainly there were answers to every German innovation, but in six short weeks the Allies did not have the time to find them.<br/><br/>Case Yellow is a simple, but accurate, simulation recreating this monumental campaign. Each game turn is divided into eight action segments. Each player has four action chits. The initiative player selects the first action chit to play. The remaining seven chits are placed in an opaque cup and drawn randomly. In most cases the Germans have the initiative and go first by playing one of their four action chits. Each German chit is marked for movement or combat, and the German player chooses what his army will do (though the German player during the course of a turn must use two chits for movement and two chits for combat). At the end of movement, any panzer or motorized formation adjacent to Allied units has the option to attack. If combat is chosen, all German units adjacent to Allied units may attack if allowed by terrain.<br/><br/>Two Allied chits are marked two for movement and two for combat &ndash; not both.  The creaky Allied command structure will bedevil the Allied player throughout the game. Need to move? Sorry &ndash; you just drew a combat chit. Set up to attack? You drew a move chit, and only the number of motorized formations equaling the roll of a six-sided die can attack.<br/><br/>Zones of control reflect that the infantry of both sides still fight by the rules of World War One. Infantry units must stop when entering an enemy zone of control. Mount a one hex infantry attack against a defender hex, and you attack only the units in the defender hex. Mount a two hex (or greater) infantry attack against a defender hex, and all adjacent enemy hexes must also be attacked (large-scale infantry attacks take time to set up, and the defender has the time to integrate adjacent units into the defense plan).<br/><br/>Motorized units play by different rules, though the Germans with their better-trained, veteran formations do it much better than the Allies. Simply stated, any motorized unit with a Troop Quality (TQ) higher than any adjacent unit may disregard those adjacent units&rsquo; zones of control for purposes of movement, combat and retreat. Only a solid line is proof against motorized unit exploitation and envelopment, and only so long as combat does not create gaps. Additionally, motorized units only may attack a defender hex from two hexes without engaging any other adjacent defender units &ndash; the speed of motorized concentration allows the attack to go in before a traditional defensive response can be established.<br/><br/>The Luftwaffe is present in overwhelming strength, allowing the German player to negate the toughest defensive positions if necessary. Each Luftwaffe asset marker provides a one column shift on the combat table. Each Allied air asset marker provides the same shift, but there are far fewer Allied markers &ndash; not that the Allies had far fewer planes (they had almost as many), but the Allied air-ground coordination was so cumbersome that planes usually did not arrive in time to influence the battles being fought.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"103357": "First Edition"}, "name": "Case Yellow, 1940: The German Blitzkrieg in the West", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "7.05199", "usersrated": "136", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "0"}, "41034": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2648293.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"22": {"name": "Steve Jackson (I)"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"147475": "Munchkin Gets Promoted"}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"25247": "Laura Balzer"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2648293_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "<br/>User Summary<br/><br/>This is a catch-all entry for various promo cards that have been handed out at various cons, release events and by MiB and Pegasus Supporters.

Players start in the North Sea with an empty Longship each, surrounded by four countries: Denmark, Norway, Scotland and England. Players have to start with plundering at least one country each in order to get some initial resources to trade with. Trading is driven by differences in the countries' resources; each country produces 2 out of the 4 resources Cloth, Furs, Thralls and Mushrooms. Nearby countries differ on one resource only, while countries on opposite sides of the North Sea have a totally different set of resources. Long-distance trading is thus more profitable, but also more dangerous as changing weather conditions can make open sea-traveling fatal.<br/><br/>The countries themselves are weak in defense and easy to plunder. However, plundering a country weakens its trading potential, so that Vikings need to defend countries they build their trade on from Vikings plundering. Plundering a country also makes its population hostile to you, so that you can't build or repair Longships there, making you more vulnerable on expeditions to those countries. The key to success is thus to keep your hostilities at an optimal level.<br/><br/>Resources gained from trading or plundering can be sacrificed to the gods in order to gain additional actions. Sacrificing Thralls to Odin gets you new fresh men to throw into the fights, sacrificing to Thor lets you change the weather conditions, get yourself a beneficial trade wind or sink your foes with mighty storms. Mushrooms make you go berserk and fight and plunder more efficiently, while Freya helps cities grow and prosper and give more trading opportunities.<br/><br/>Resources can also be used to build new Longships, increasing the Viking's trading and military power. Just like in real life, the winner at the end of the game is the player with the most Longships.<br/><br/>"}, "41066": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1276971.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"674": {"name": "Ed Beach"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"2652": "Charles Kibler"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"52": {"name": "GMT Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "420", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1276971_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "420", "boardgamecategory": {"1026": {"name": "Negotiation"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"23063": "2012 Charles S. Roberts Best Ancient to Napoleonic Era Board Wargame Nominee"}, "description": "from GMT website:<br/><br/>Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is a game of grand strategy for two to six players based on the military, political and religious conflicts within Europe during the reigns of Elizabeth I of England and Philip II of Spain. Each player controls one or more of the major powers that presided over European politics in that day. Spain is the juggernaut, able to draw upon the vast riches of their global empire. But such a dominant power is sure to have many enemies. The Ottoman expansion towards Spain's Mediterranean outposts remains unchecked. Elizabeth's English sea dogs are poised to raid Spain's overseas empire. And the forces of Protestant reform will soon drag Spain into eighty years of rebellion in the Netherlands. Will Spain find aid from its Catholic allies? Perhaps not from France, where the Catholic Valois dynasty is soon to engage another group of Protestant believers in the bloody French Wars of Religion. And even Philip's relatives in Vienna who rule the Holy Roman Empire may dabble in the Protestant faith instead of remaining loyal to their Catholic heritage and Spanish brethren.<br/><br/>The six powers in Virgin Queen are:<br/><br/>     Ottoman<br/>     Spain<br/>     England<br/>     France<br/>     Holy Roman Empire<br/>     Protestants (Dutch &amp; Huguenots)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is the sequel to Here I Stand, another card-driven game of grand strategy that covered the previous forty years (from Martin Luther's posting of his 95 Theses in 1517 through the abdication of Charles V in 1556). Players familiar with Here I Stand will find much that is familiar in Virgin Queen as over half of the rule book remains unchanged. New game systems have been put in place to emphasize the changing nature of the conflicts here in the late 16th Century:<br/><br/><br/>     Religion: Streamlined from Here I Stand, the new rules for religious conversion and rebellion allow actions to be resolved quickly, reflecting the already entrenched presence of both Catholic and Protestant factions across the key areas of religious struggle.<br/>     World Map: Oceanic expeditions are now under direct player control as they sail to the Caribbean and beyond to seize plunder, found colonies, and attempt to circumnavigate the globe.<br/>     Diplomatic Influence: Alliances with minor powers (and major powers that can be activated in games with fewer than six players) are now made through a unified system where players buy influence at each of these foreign courts.<br/>     Weddings: Here I Stand&rsquo;s secret negotiation phase is still present here in Virgin Queen, but with a new twist. Now you will want to arrange marriages for each of the princes and princesses of your family dynasty with a suitable foreign royal. Will even the Virgin Queen succumb to love and take a husband, or will she jilt that suitor at the last minute once again?<br/>     Patronage: Your royal court will be visited by artists, writers, scientists, and architects, who all want you to invest in their endeavors for the glory and advancement of the realm. Will you sponsor Galileo, Cervantes, or Shakespeare or instead spend your treasury on a fruitless quest for the Philosopher's Stone?<br/>     Espionage: Beware, there is also a dark side to this period &ndash; a time of espionage and spymasters. In Virgin Queen you can ask your ambassadors to spy on foreign courts, send out handgun-armed assassins, invest in cryptology, and even recruit Jesuit priests for undercover missions of conversion. <br/><br/><br/>There are several different scenarios included allowing your play sessions to be tailored to the number of players and time available:<br/><br/>     Two-Player Tutorial: Great for new players just learning the series, this 90-minute game pits the Ottomans against Spain during the time of the Siege of Malta and Battle of Lepanto. Uses a subset of the full rules so you can dive in quickly.<br/>     Campaign Scenario: The full Virgin Queen experience, this eight-hour game can last up to seven turns and is normally played with from 4 to six players. Variant rules allow you to play with just two or three players if desired.<br/>     Armada Scenario: A quicker game focused on Turns 3 to 6 of the full campaign, this 4 to 5-hour game is ideal for tournament play.

In the end, over 6000 Indians were slain or captured and sold into slavery. Over 2600 Colonials were captured or killed. In the end King Philip (The Wampanoag sachem, Metacomet) himself was ambushed, beheaded, and quartered. King Philip's hands were sent to the authorities in Plymouth as proof of his demise. Countless Indian villages had been burned; twelve Colonial settlements were completely destroyed and six more heavily damaged. Boston itself very nearly came under attack. In all, 1200 homes were burned, 8000 head of cattle lost, and vast stores of food destroyed. Some sources claim one soldier in ten on both sides was either injured or killed.<br/><br/>My (the designer's) treatment of this broad conflict is simplified. Only a handful of key settlements are named for historical interest while rivers and settlements are placed not so much for geographic and historic accuracy but for ease of play. The forces involved are also necessarily reduced to create a simpler, quicker game.

WARLANDS pits the last human survivors against each other and the unnatural horrors that breed in the wastelands and dead cities. Strap yourself in for high octane action from small scale skirmishes to epic battles, The WARLANDS sing with the screams of the dying and the roar of machines&hellip;<br/><br/>WARLANDS is a turbo-charged miniature game of cinematic combat set in the ruins of a post-apocalyptic earth. Where the last remnants of Man battle for supremacy and resources against mutants, the dead and each other! Where the warriors of the <br/>wastelands want but one thing, the black gold, the guzzoline.&quot;<br/><br/>Warlands is a miniatures wargame involving vehicular combat in a post-apocalyptic (Road Warrior, Deathrace, Doomsday, etc. inspired) setting.  Players can build forces of weaponized cars, trucks, dune-buggies, bikes, walkers, as well as foot infantry.<br/><br/>Gameplay is quick and is alternating activation.  Players roll for initiative, and each activates a model, based on speed, where they move, shoot, accelerate, decelerate and perform special actions (emergency braking, bootlegger reverse, un-jam weapon, etc).  Once all activations have been performed the turn ends.<br/><br/>Each vehicle type (Car, Truck, Buggie, Semi, Walker, etc) has their own special abilities and base attributes.  These include their speed and maneuverability, ability to absorb damage, and off-road capabilities.<br/><br/>Shooting involves die rolling, where shooter must roll higher than a fixed target value, based on the target's current speed (the faster it's going, the harder it is to hit).  Models in very close range get extra bonuses to hit.  Shooting has critical success / failure mechanisms, where a success would be an auto hit and a failure results in a weapons jam.<br/><br/>Damage is modified by the target's armor and the weapons armor penetration value.  This will determine the target value for the dice rolled to damage the target.  Each target has a number of hit points.  Critical damage rolls result in special damage to a vehicle that can range from degrading its performance to outright destroying it in a ball of fire.<br/><br/>Movement has compulsory movement to simulate momentum, and varies by the model type and current speed.  Each model has a number of 45 degree turns it's allowed within a turn and how far it must move in a straight line before it can turn again.  Special Maneuvers require a die roll to beat a target value, the roll is modified by the driver's skill, current vehicle speed and available turns the vehicle has.  Success generally means the vehicle can turn or maneuver any way it wants, failure results in random movement or total wipe-out of vehicle.<br/><br/>The scale is 20mm and is compatible with most die-cast toy cars (Matchbox, Hotwheels, etc.).  The line will include not only vehicles but blister packs of weapons and customization bitz to upgrade existing toy cars.  At first this seems odd for a miniatures wargaming scale, but the movement works well within a 4x4 table and being able to customize toy cars will be a hobby in itself.<br/><br/>"}, "41164": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Nosh", "playingtime": "25", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1010986_t.png", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"233": {"name": "Invicta Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1010986.png", "boardgameversion": {"155786": "Invicta Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "25", "description": "This card game introduces and encourages healthy eating.

The fact that now you can build right away when you bought a property, gives so much dynamic to the game. No more waiting until you have the whole set, or not having the set because one player refuses to trade. Even with a couple of single properties you can win the game.<br/><br/>But not so fast. Everybody wants to win of course. And with the 80 extra buildings they added to the game, nothing was ever so uncertain. On every property you can build residential or industrial buildings. The first is not protected against negative buildings (hazards) and requires positive buildings otherwise the property becomes worthless. The industrial buildings on the other hand are protected but they cost twice as much! So you will have to make choice.

Instead of controlling one crew member in adventure style missions you&rsquo;ll be able to play Battlestations: Fleet Actions taking charge of multiple ships and crews. No referee is needed as players battle each other for mission objectives, all the while gaining prestige, leveling up their crews with new ship wide special abilities.<br/><br/>Featured is a new sleek rule set that has all the familiar Battlestations feel, but built for quicker and faster resolution on a massive scale. The familiar power levels in the ships are there with a few minor tweaks. For starters, all ships have unlimited helm power allowing them to perform a number of actions a phase only limited by the number of pilots. As a drawback however, any ship that fails in a piloting maneuver loses the rest of it&rsquo;s actions! Make sure those pilots go last! If you have to turn the ship to fire weapons make sure you make your skill check! Guns and shields work a little differently. The size of your ship determines the power that both guns and shields can have combined. It&rsquo;s up to the player to decide how that power is split. So a size 9 ship has 9 points of power to split between guns and shields. Unlike Battlestations energy levels never drop and there&rsquo;s no more power generation before a round begins. This means there&rsquo;s only ever two times during the course of the game that you have to adjust power levels; if your engines go down or if you transfer power. No more power booking keeping between rounds.<br/><br/>Another new game mechanic is automatic actions. By activating crew some actions happen automatically.<br/><br/>"}, "41189": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1268580.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"748": {"name": "Markus Nikisch"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"15754": "Michael Bayer"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"384": {"name": "HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1268580_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "description": "Card Game version of Haba's Award-winning Animal Upon Animal Game.

The events each have an icon next to them to show a specific type: e.g. car, tennis player, Olympic rings, airplane, dollar sign, national flag, anchor, skull, etc.<br/><br/>There are rules to three games included.

Acceptable melds are: chains, 3 or more consecutive years; and matches: 3 or more that have the same event icon.  Players can also add to their previous melds, but not to others'.  When a player goes out, the others receive penalty points for what's left in their hand.  1999 cards are wild, and each player may use their birth year as a personal wild.  If you have a 2000 card may play it to the table and draw a replacement, taking up your whole turn; 2000's in your hand at the end add to your penalties.<br/><br/>Century Chain is Uno-like.  Players may play a card to the discard pile if it matches one of its icons, or is adjacent in year.  You may continue playing until you have nothing left.  If you have nothing to start, you may draw one card instead.  (1999s and 2000s are not included in this game.)

As the captain of the Horan watched, flanking forces detached themselves first from the European fleet, quickly followed by matching elements from the Union fleet. These elements would attempt to get around the heavy screens to the key units the escorts were protecting, the flagship and carriers.

You won&rsquo;t have to spend an hour or two playing a single game.

To do this, check for the player&rsquo;s shots grade (&quot;Sh&quot; on the roster sheet), roll all 3 dice and consult the &quot;Player Shots&quot; chart.<br/><br/>3) Resolve the shots for each player (i.e., determine the outcome of each player&rsquo;s shots on goal.) and assign assists (the number of assists for each goal is indicated on the goal scoring chart).<br/><br/>Fast Action Hockey will produce lifelike statistical performances over the course of an entire replay season when playing schedules similar to the actual.<br/><br/>(Game was marketed on a limited scale in 2001 only, and sold primarily through Ebay).<br/><br/>"}, "41247": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mia", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "600", "usersrated": "79", "boardgamefamily": {"22160": "Dice cup bluffing games"}, "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic451926_t.jpg", "average": "6.31139", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic451926.jpg", "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Mia is an ancient bluffing dice game using two dice and a cup to conceal the dice.  It is believed to have been played by the Vikings.  There are affinities with Liar's Dice (and the card game Bullshit), but also some interesting differences.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling the dice beneath a cup and announcing a higher roll than the previous roll.  This announcement can be challenged, with the roller losing a life if caught lying, and the challenger losing a life if the roller was truthful (players typically start with three lives).  There is also the option (instead of rolling the dice oneself or challenging the previous roller) of  passing your turn (without viewing the roll under the cup) to the next player.  In this case the passer assumes responsibility for the roll as if he or she had rolled it him- or herself.  (Thus, if the next player challenges the announced value, it is the passer who stands to lose a life if the value under the cup is not that which was announced.)<br/><br/>One interesting feature of Mia is the non-standard ordering of rolls. &quot;21&quot; is &quot;Mia&quot;, the highest roll.  Next come the doubles in ascending order: 11 is the second best roll, then 22, 33, 44, 55, 66.  From there the numbers descend, with the higher die always naming the tens value and the lower die naming the ones value:  65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 54, 53, 52, 51, 43, 42, 41, 32, and 31 as the lowest value.<br/><br/>Similar to Cheat.<br/><br/>"}, "41248": {"boardgamedesigner": {"11691": {"name": "Steven Beard"}}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Frostbitten!", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"7488": "Animals: Penguins"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic450872_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic450872.jpg", "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A new &quot;Ice Age&quot; has struck the planet! <br/>Ice floes are circling the oceans, allowing Antarctic penguins to drift into the territory of Arctic polar bears. <br/>Get your penguins safely from the South Pole to the North Pole across drifting ice floes whilst watching out for a hungry Polar Bear. <br/>This is a piecepack port of Milton-Bradley&rsquo;s &quot;Polar Dare!&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "41250": {"boardgamedesigner": {"779": {"name": "Anders Jeppsson"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "T\u00e5rtkalaset", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic601082_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"404": {"name": "Alga"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic601082.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"182406": "Finnish edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "In this game waits the most delicious cream cake on you and your opponents.

If a word is played, each other player in turn gets a chance to add cards from their hand to the played word to make a different word, without changing the order.  The last to add to the word wins it.  Words score 1 per letter, doubled if monochrome, doubled if a palindrome.<br/><br/>Beta: A solitaire game.  Deal 6 cards out in a line, starting 6 columns.  You may move individual cards to the top of bottom of another column, removing words as completed.  When done moving, deal another card to the bottom of each column (or empty slot if a column is empty).  Continue until the deck is gone, trying to eliminate the whole deck.<br/><br/>Capa: A bridge-like partnership trick-taking game.  Players first bid the number of words to make, along with a color (not black).  Highest bid gets his color as trump, and his partner is dummy.  Player to his left leads first.  All plays must follow suit if possible, unless black is led.  If a word is made in the color led, the leader wins the trick; if a word is made in a different color or multiple colors, the one who added the last card to it wins; if no word is made the leader wins.  If the contractors get as many words as bid, they score for all words won, else the opponents score for all the words they won; words are scored as in Alpha.<br/><br/>"}, "41271": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic458450.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11413": {"name": "Daniel Clark (I)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"17": {"name": "Fantasy Flight Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic458450_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "In the  World of Warcraft , there are many heroes and many perils.

Alternate rules add chips and betting typical to poker, with up to 3 rounds of betting.<br/><br/>Soli-WhizORD: A solitaire game.  Player deals himself 10 hands as if in Poker-WhizORD -- including one draw -- and scores their best word.  The goal is 300 points.<br/><br/>Rummy-WhizORD: Players have 7-card hands, and in each turn they play and score a word or pass and discard any number of cards; then they draw back up to 7.  Winner is the first to an agreed total.<br/><br/>Thirty-WhizORD: Players start with 7-card hands, and in their turn draw 1 and discard 1.  The first player with a 30-point word in hand calls &quot;Thirty!&quot;, lays it down and wins the hand.  Play to an agreed number of hands or wins.<br/><br/>Hangman-WhizORD: Players each think of a word with the same number of letters, and pick their letters out of the deck, laying them out face down in the opponent's reading order.  Take turns guessing letters, correct guesses being revealed, incorrect guesses being noted to avoid repeats.  You may guess the word but if guessed wrong you lose; otherwise the first one to expose all the opponent's letters wins.<br/><br/>Match'Em-WhizORD: 12 or more matching pairs of letters are pulled from the deck, suffled and laid out on the table.  Players reveal 2 cards in their turn, keeping matches, as in Concentration/Pelmanism.<br/><br/>Precitd-WhizORD: One card is revealed.  Each player reveals another card in turn, but first predicts whether their card will precede or follow the first card.  The player who predicted correctly, and has the letter closest to the first letter, captures all the cards; no one wins if a tie or a card matches the first one.

The first player to get three of his pieces to his opponent's start line (or prevents his opponent from winning) wins the game.<br/><br/>Each turn, two six-sided dice are rolled and the results, like in backgammon, can move one or two of your pieces.

It is played with 40 cards (remove the 8s, 9s, 10s from a standard 52 card deck). The rank of the cards in each suit, from highest rank to lowest one, is: Ace, 7, King, Jack, Queen, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. As well as the high position of the seven, notice that the jack beats the queen..<br/><br/>The game is played clockwise. The first dealer is chosen at random and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.The player to the dealer's right shuffles the cards and the player at the dealer's left cuts. The dealer then gives 10 cards to each player, in a single batch, beginning with the player to dealer's left, going around clockwise and ending with the dealer. The bottom card of the deck, which belongs to the dealer, is turned face up, and its suit becomes trumps.Alternatively, the dealer can choose to deal the first ten cards to himself, the next ten to the player to his right, and so on counter-clockwise. In this case the dealer's first card (the original top card of the deck) is turned up and determines the trump suit.<br/><br/>The player to the left of the dealer (the one who cut the cards) leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if they can. A player who has no card of the suit led may play any card. If any cards of the trump suit are played to a trick, the highest trump wins. Otherwise, the trick is won by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.<br/><br/>Being considered a &quot;deaf-dumb persons game&quot; in Portugal, there can be no talking between the players and no exchange of signals between partners (considered cheating in tournament play). In casual play, though, this rule is frequently overridden, with signs actually being negotiated between partners prior to playing, which adds a different level of fun to the game - as each team tries to discover the others cheating signs so they can get the upper hand in play.<br/><br/>In Sueca, the aim is to win tricks containing valuable cards. The card values are:<br/>Ace ..... 11 points<br/>7 ..... 10 points<br/>King ..... 4 points<br/>Jack ..... 3 points<br/>Queen ..... 2 points<br/>The rest of the cards = no points.<br/><br/>There are 120 points in the deck altogether.<br/><br/>The object of the play is to win tricks containing more than half of the card points. The team which takes more than 60 card points scores one game. The first team to score four games win the rubber.<br/><br/>If a team takes 91 or more card points in tricks on one deal, they score two games instead of one.<br/><br/>If they take all the tricks they score four games and thus win the rubber immediately. Taking 120 points but losing a trick (with no counting cards in it) is not sufficient to win the rubber. In this case the winning team would just score 2 games for having more than 90.<br/><br/>In case of tie it's considered a null game... no team gets any point.&quot;<br/><br/>There is a variant called Sueca Italiana which is for 5 players.<br/><br/>"}, "41355": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Inter Biss", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1970", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic450622_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1772": {"name": "Clipper"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic450622.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"140844": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The game contains a playing board with four squares (countries!) depicted on it.

Packs go across the landscapes and they try to hunt down as many mammoths as possible (by going across cards with pictures of mammoths on them), so that they have proteins to grow their brains more quickly and to rise on the evolutionary meter. By doing this the skills of the pack will grow and evolutionary advantages can be acquired. The winner of the game is the person who will be the first to complete his evolution by reaching the level of a human homo-sapiens.

Its deck has 36 cards, all with letters except for two Blockade Cards, which just take up space in the hand without being usable.  It also includes cardboard chits labeled &quot;5 Points&quot; or &quot;10 Points&quot;; some editions include a pocket dictionary.  The rules describe five games:<br/><br/>Original Bild-A-Word: 5 cards each are dealt.  In the first round, each player in turn lays 1-2 words of 2+ letters on the table, or adds letters to an existing word (rearranging if needed) to make a new word, or passes.  From then on, a turn starts by drawing 1 card and ends with discarding 1 card; if the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discards to restock it.  The hand ends when a player empties his hand, and he scores 5 points per cards held in others' hands -- the point chits are used to keep score.  250 points wins the game.<br/><br/>Bild-A-Word Triplets: Like the Original game, except that after the deal, 3 cards are placed in separate rows on the table.  Players may not start new words, but only try to add to the existing rows to make new words.  Letters may be rearranged within a row but not moved between rows.<br/><br/>Bild-A-Word Marathon:  8 cards are dealt to the table.  In each turn, a player makes a word out of any 2 or more letters on the table.  They may not repeat previous words, and have only 1 minute per turn.  When a player is stumped they are out; the winner is the last player to come up with a word.<br/><br/>Bild-A-Word Wits: Like 5 card draw poker with words.  Players start with 100 points worth of Point chits, and win on getting 300 points worth.  Hands are ranked by the length of the words in them: 5 letters; 4; 3&amp;2; 3; 2&amp;2; 2.  Ties are broken by the letters earliest in the alphabet.<br/><br/>Bild-A-Word Quinto: Like gin rummy.  Players start with 5 cards, and in a turn draw 1 and discard 1.  The first to make a 5-letter word from his hand calls &quot;Quinto&quot; and lays his hand down.  All other players lay down their hands and make the longest word they can; the winner gets 5 point for each unused card.

(For two or more players, ages 10 and up).&quot;<br/><br/>Four were published:<br/><br/>The Wizard's Bane<br/><br/>The Cleric's Quest - &quot;the adventures of a young cleric (holy man or woman) as he (or she) dons armor and weapons to fulfill a holy quest - a journey which brings him (or her) into combat with animated Skeletons, a pair of Hell hounds, a female Demon, and a fearsome Devil.&quot;<br/><br/>The Fighter's Fury - &quot;the adventures of a young knight and his friend as they do battle with Goblins, foul Orcs, a huge Troll, and an evil Baron in a quest to avenge the death of the young knight's father.&quot;<br/><br/>The Woman Warrior - &quot;the adventures of a young woman warrior and her friend as they do battle with Bandits, Kobolds (small fierce dog like creatures), giant Bugbears, and a huge fearsome Ogre, in a quest for treasure and glory.&quot;<br/><br/>Each contains two leaflets, one containing the rules and adventure; the other, a painting guide for the miniatures.  Though each game has a unique background story and series of encounters, the rules of play are identical.  On the last page of the rules leaflet is a promotion for Heritage's soon-to-be-released (at that time) RPG, Swordbearer.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of running two characters through a series of four encounters (combats).  Each side in a combat takes turns.  During a turn, all characters on the active side fight, then all characters on the active side may use magic, pick up or throw things, or run away.<br/><br/>Fighting is resolved by cross-indexing the roll of a six-sided die with the letter code of the attacker's weapon (A, B, C or D) on a table corresponding to the defender's armor (which may be light, medium, or heavy) in order to find how much damage, if any, was done to the defender.<br/><br/>The miniatures aren't necessary to play, and aren't even mentioned in the game rules.<br/><br/>"}, "41399": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic458786.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1994", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"9296": {"name": "Novar Cottage"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic458786_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "A Bible-oriented word card game.

Newcomers will appreciate how straight-forward and easy to learn the basic system is, while naval wargaming veterans can take advantage of the optional rule system to add additional detail to the game.<br/><br/>NT: CoD has been designed from the keel up to be fun, fast paced, and full of flavor so that you can focus on the thrill of commanding a ship or fleet at sea instead of tedious charts or calculations.  A battle involving a dozen battleships and battlecruisers on each side can be fought to a conclusion in a couple hours while offering a play experience with significant tactical depth.<br/><br/>The robust optional rules system allows the game to grow with you as you gain experience - ensuring that Naval Thunder will be your naval miniatures system of choice for years to come.  There are more than 20 completely modular optional rules that allow you to model historically accurate factors influencing naval combat of the era.

It covers the exploits of the 101st in their battles from D-Day through the Bulge. The rules are very simple (no combat charts are needed) with very few exceptions to remember and yet the game is meant to be all encompassing and will include infantry, tanks, and artillery.<br/><br/>Based on years of research, the game system uses a unique suppression mechanic.  There are no longer two unique states for a unit, but varying degrees of suppression.  This allows suppression to accumulate from multiple fire sources and means that the unit will not take a morale check until it is asked to do something.  You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.<br/><br/>Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops.  Their goal is to fire and maneuver.  Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close.  The system itself forces this realistic play.  In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.<br/><br/>Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.<br/><br/>The game is the first in a series.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers:  Ghost Panzer is a stand alone game that is set on the Eastern Front and follows the German 11th Panzer (Ghost) Division<br/><br/>Other games under research are &quot;The Old Breed&quot; (the US 1st Marine Division) and a module that follows Commonwealth forces.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"111081": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "average": "7.8641", "name": "Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "425", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22797": "Band of Brothers"}}, "41431": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic545745.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1970", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"9280": {"name": "Church Enterprises"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic545745_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "description": "Pedigree - A Genealogy Game is a deduction game similar to Clue with an LDS religious theme and simplified rules for children.

Hardly a farm house which has no cego deck. The game is played mainly throughout the winter, when there is little work to do in the fields and few daylight hours.<br/><br/>A Cego deck consists of 54 cards: 22 &quot;Truck&quot;, that means trump cards, 16 &quot;Bilder&quot; or picture cards, king, queen, knight and jack in the 4 suits. and 16 &quot;Leere&quot; or empty cards, also in the 4 suits.<br/>The 22 trumps are numbered from 1 to 21, and a single picture card without suit, which would be #22, the highest trump, commonly called &quot;Gsties&quot;, sometimes &quot;Sk&uuml;s&quot; from ital. &quot;scusa&quot; = sorry (for taking the trick).<br/><br/>The game is basically a trick tacking game, you've got to follow suit, if not available you have to trump.<br/><br/>Usually one player will play against the other three, the player following the dealer will have to play if no one bids for the play.<br/><br/>Cards are dealt 11 to each player and 10 face down in the middle (the Cego or blind cards). These 10 cards will go to the highest bidder, depending on his bid either remaining face down or he discards 9 or 10 cards from his hand and takes up the Cego cards. A simple play would be a bid for Cego, discarding 9 cards from your hand, taking up 10 cards, then choosing one additional card for your pile and starting play.<br/><br/>This is the interesting and unusual part of this game. Your decision to bid depends on the cards which you will not have available for the coming game, but you will get to play with mainly unknown cards. Therefore the title &quot;Blind&quot;.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other options, available for every player or only the bidder, for example:<br/>-Solo play: when you have lots of trump in your initial play, no cards are discarded.<br/>-R&auml;uber, rubber: when no one bids, every player on his own, you try to have fewest points.<br/>-Bettel: the bidder tries to get no cards.<br/>-Piccolo: the bidder tries to make exactly one trick.<br/><br/>Scoring is done by counting out your points, only three trumps (Gstiess, 21 and 1) and all the pictures count.<br/>Points and counting method differ, but the bidder always need the majority of points, every 5 points over or under mean an additional factor.<br/><br/>"}, "41450": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1692672.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1992", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"792": {"name": "Crown & Andrews Ltd."}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1692672_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "description": "Each player is a Cat Burglar (literally, a cat wearing a burglar mask), attempting to sneak into a mansion to steal some valuable jewels from the safe.

The first player to remove the jewels from the safe wins.<br/><br/>The game uses a roll-and-move mechanic. On his turn, a player rolls the dice, and may then decide either to move his Cat Burglar, or to move one of the two Police Dogs.<br/><br/>The board is assembled from four large puzzle-piece shaped segments, which depict various rooms inside the mansion. A plastic dial is inserted into each corner of the board, which players use to track lives. A fifth board section, made from plastic, depicts the vault room, and sits in the middle of the board. This section has a safe which the players must crack, and several of the spaces on the middle section are alarmed.<br/><br/>The key feature of the game is the plastic &quot;vault room&quot; which sits in the middle of the board. All the spaces in the vault room are potentially alarmed - There are small metal contacts embedded in each space. Some of them are decoys, and some will trigger an alarm when the metal base of the cat burglar pieces comes into contact, completing an electronic circuit. The safe itself is a dexterity mini-game; although players are given the combination for the lock at the start of the game, if their hand shakes, or they get the combination slightly wrong, it triggers an alarm.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/><br/>4 Mansion Room puzzle-piece board sections<br/>4 Coloured plastic Cat Burglar pieces with a metal base<br/>2 Plastic Police Dog pieces<br/>4 Plastic Gems (one of each player colour)<br/>4 Plastic dials for tracking lives (one of each player colour)<br/>1 Plastic vault room plus battery cover<br/>1 Plastic safe core plus lid<br/>Dice<br/>Rulebook<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"112326": "First Edition"}, "average": "5", "name": "Cat Burglar", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "age": "5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7334": "Animals: Cats"}}, "41451": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic454465.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11655": {"name": "Nate French"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"12438": "Ryan Barger"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2973": {"name": "Edge Entertainment"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic454465_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "The Summons of the Deep  expansion to the Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game commences with its first monthly Asylum Pack of 40 fixed cards, The Spawn of the Sleeper.

Designed for fun and playability, Chevauchee is perfect for novice and veteran gamers alike and offers a basic set of man-to-man combat rules, expanded optional rules, and a special system for simple siege warfare. It can be played with almost any appropriate miniature figures, each of which can use whatever weapons it is armed with and is equipped with whatever armor the model wears, eliminating paperwork and speeding play.  Each turn represents 20 seconds of action.  Essentially, combat is resolved with 3d6 rolls (with modifiers) versus a target number.  There is no set size for a playing area.  Distance is measured in inches.

You must not only destroy the targets but you must also balance the delicate political repercussions of your attacks. If you strike too hard, your air offensive might be put on hold, strike too light, and you&rsquo;ll be blamed for losing the war.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Vietnam Air War!<br/><br/>Each of the campaigns can be played with either an Air Force or Navy squadron. The targets assigned to each service are different and change the complexion of the campaigns. Each campaign can be played with three different durations of: Skirmish, Conflict, or War.<br/><br/>Each mission takes roughly 30 minutes to set-up, plan, and resolve.<br/><br/>Each of your pilots has their own skills. Selecting the right pilots and weapons for a mission is vital to its success. As you fly missions, your pilots will gain experience and fatigue. With experience, their skills improve, but as their fatigue increases, their skills decrease and they might not be able to fly for several missions.<br/><br/>For those of you familiar with our modern era Hornet Leader series of games, you might be wondering what&rsquo;s different about Phantom Leader&hellip;<br/><br/>The freedom of being able to select the best mission based on military objectives is something that is commonplace for today&rsquo;s military. Back in Vietnam, the military was responsible for carrying out their orders, while at the same time being extremely limited in the weapons and tactics they were allowed to use to complete those orders. In many cases, the specific weapons, approach paths, and bombing altitudes were generated target-by-target at the White House. The mission specifics were then sent down the chain of command to the individual pilots flying the mission. As you can imagine, this was not the best way to run an air campaign.<br/><br/>Every target has a Political value. If you destroy it, you move the Political counter to the right a number of spaces equal to its value. As the counter gets moved to the right, your future target choices are reduced to those that are less politically sensitive. Which target you choose not to attack is also important. You get to move the Political counter to the left a number of spaces equal its Political value. [this last sentence is not in fact true for the game, though it appears in the game blurb; confirmed by the author]<br/><br/>This means that while you might like to flatten a big enemy target and rack up the victory points, it might be better for you to choose a pointless target and move the Political counter in your favor instead.<br/><br/>Another difference is in combat power. For the last couple decades, the US Air Force and Navy have enjoyed air superiority due to training and technology. Such was not the case in the skies over Vietnam. The enemy had different, but just as capable, equipment. They also had the training and will to use it to its utmost.<br/><br/>They soon became aware of the limitations placed on the US forces by the politicians, and used those limitations to their advantage.<br/><br/>For example, at times, US pilots were not permitted to fire on enemy aircraft until they were visually identified. This negated any range advantage conveyed by the radar-homing AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. It was also a common limitation that enemy aircraft could only be attacked in the air. US pilots were not allowed to attack enemy airbases. US aircraft were also limited to flying predictable flight paths, at set times. This made setting up ambushes much easier for the enemy.<br/><br/>So, while you might be a Hornet Leader ace, Vietnam is a whole different ballgame!<br/><br/>Components: <br/><br/>     110 Full color Cards <br/>         12 F-4 Phantom IIs (USAF) <br/>         8 F-105 Thunderchiefs (USAF)<br/>         2 F-105G Wild Weasels (USAF)<br/>         4 F-100 Super Sabers (USAF) <br/>         2 F-104A Starfighters (USAF)<br/>         1 EB-66 Destroyer (USAF)<br/>         8 F-4 Phantom IIs (USN) <br/>         6 A-4 Skyhawks (USN)<br/>         5 A-7 Corsair II (USN) <br/>         5 A-6 Intruders (USN) <br/>         4 F-8 Crusaders (USN)<br/>         1 EA-6A Electric Intruder (USN) <br/>         34 Targets <br/>         18 Special Events <br/>    <br/>     Full Color, 20-page Rulebook <br/>     Full Color Double-sided Counter Sheet (176 x 5/8&quot; counters) <br/>     6 Full Color Campaign Sheets <br/>         War in the South (1965) USAF &amp; USN<br/>         Rolling Thunder (1967) USAF &amp; USN<br/>         Linebacker (1972) USAF &amp; USN<br/>    <br/>     3 Full Color Player Aid Cards <br/>         Tactical Display<br/>         Card Diplay Sheet<br/>         Help Sheet<br/>    <br/>     1 Ten-sided die <br/>     1 Player Log master (to be photocopied prior to play)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Phantom Leader Deluxe<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"29215": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.52106", "name": "Phantom Leader", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "433", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"3268": "Leader Series"}}, "41491": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8933": {"name": "Richard Hutnik"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Simultaneous Captain's Mistress", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2020": "Simultaneous Action Selection"}, "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic613326_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8206": {"name": "IAGO World Tour Enterprises"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic613326.jpg", "boardgamefamily": {"4220": "n in a row"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "In this game, the objective is to get four in a row, by players dropping checkers into a line.
