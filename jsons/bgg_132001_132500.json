Players may choose to play a quick game by each using one, 28-card deck, or they may opt for a longer, more complex game, where each player uses five, 28 card decks!  Using multiple decks makes it possible to &ldquo;level up&rdquo; your monsters, making them stronger over the coarse of the game... yeah, you heard me: your cards can level up like characters in a video game.  Level 9 is currently the highest, although the system is designed in a way that makes it possible to release more expansions in the future; meaning your cards could level up infinitely!<br/><br/>The game was designed for 2 players, although variations for 1, 3 and 4 players have been added. Most games that claim you can play solo, end up being designed for 1 person, leaving players feeling as if they are playing a solo game alongside other players. This system uses a card driven AI, so when you are playing solo, you still feel that you are playing against another person. Of coarse the artificial intelligence is not as smart as a human brain, so the AI is given some special advantages to make it a worthy opponent. The four player variant is simply a 2 on 2 battle, that feels almost the same as a 2 player game, but you are partnered up with a teammate, with whom you can trade cards and devise strategies.<br/><br/>Further, Scared to Death can be played using only the cards, or with an add-on betting system that uses tokens, money, or even Halloween candy!   Overall, the Card System opens up a wide range of possibilities, including new, and entirely separate games that can be played using your existing Scared to Death cards.<br/><br/>"}, "132009": {"boardgamedesigner": {"48029": {"name": "Craig Guarisco"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "The Chronicles of Abakan: The Titan Campaigns", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"64383": "Luca Zampriolo"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"23693": {"name": "Game Smiths LLC"}}, "boardgameversion": {"183946": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1016": {"name": "Science Fiction"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Welcome to the dystopian future of The Chronicles of Abakan: The Titan Campaigns, a new board game based on the visually stunning and evocative world imagined by the brilliant international sculptor and painter, Luca Zampriolo.

These miniatures are based on Luca Zampriolo&rsquo;s original designs, and the models themselves are sculpted by Luca Zampriolo himself, as well as Filippo Zanicotti of Dust Tactics fame.

The player whose forces collectively have greater control over the surrendered Axis powers will win the peace and the game.<br/><br/>Churchill is NOT a wargame, but a political conflict of cooperation and competition. While the game focuses on 10 of the historical conferences from 1943 till the end of the war these and much of this design should not be taken literally. Before and after each conference small groups of advisors and senior officials moved between the Allied capitals making the deals that drove the post war peace. Each conference sees one of a group of issues nominated for inclusion in the conference. The issues categories are: Theater leadership changes, directed offensives, production priorities, clandestine operations, political activity, and strategic warfare (A-bomb). Each of the historical conference cards independently puts some number of issues such as directed offensives or production priorities metaphorically put on the table, while the players nominate an additional 7 issues.<br/><br/>The game display for this is a circular conference table that the three players sit around behind their 'seat'. Each player has a staff deck of named personages, such as Secretary Stimson and Anthony Eden that are randomly drawn to make your conference hand. A pre-conference round of cards gives leverage to the winner who then moves an issue toward their side of the table equal to the value of the card played. Play then proceeds with the conference where each player in turn plays a card on one of the issues in the center of the conference table moving it the value of the card toward his side of the table. Each card is an historical personage and they often have bonuses if played on a particular category of issue. Contesting an issue has you move an issue away from an Ally toward your own. At all times each player has his Head of State card (Roosevelt, Churchill, or Stalin) that can weigh in on any issue once per conference by discarding another card. Each use of your personage has a bonus and a potential penalty. Each time Roosevelt is used he may die and be replaced by Harry Truman. Churchill can have a heart attack and miss the next conference, while Stalin's paranoia may cause a mini-purge and reduce his side's effectiveness for the remainder of the conference. The net result of the conference play is players will 'win' various issues with the player who won the most issues gaining leverage in one of the bilateral global issues (UK versus USSR global issue is Free Europe versus Spheres of Influence).<br/><br/>The game then moves into a post-conference phase where players implement the issues that they now control. These actions impact three basic game functions: clandestine operations, political activity, and military offensives. Clandestine operations has players try to establish political networks in conquered countries and colonies. Using a very simple mechanic of placing a network or removing an opponent's network, the historical ferment that occurred in Yugoslavia, France and across the world is simply simulated. A country or colony can only have one dominant side's network at any given time, and during political activity players can emplace friendly governments in exile that can be subsequently undermined and replaced if the supporting networks are later neutralized by one of your allies.<br/><br/>Once this has all been sorted out, the military portion of the game keeps the score. There is a separate display that abstractly represents the major theaters of war, Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Arctic (Murmansk convoys and Scandinavia), CBI, SW Pacific, Central Pacific, and Far East. Each of these tracks has a Allied front for which I am looking for some kind of 3D tank piece that advances toward Germany, Italy, and Japan. Using a very simple combat mechanic, each front tries to advance with Axis reserves deploying to oppose the various fronts. A successful offensive advances the front one space, although with overwhelming superiority a two-space breakthrough is possible. Naval operations are simply handled by requiring a defined level of support to advance into an amphibious entry space such as France (D-Day). When a front enters Germany, Italy or Japan they surrender, shutting down military operations, although clandestine and political activity continues until the end of the game. In the background is the development of the A-bomb and Soviet efforts to steal its secrets. If the A-bomb is available Japan can be forced to surrender sans a direct invasion.<br/><br/>As I stated this is not a wargame, but a three-player excursion into power politics. The game takes around 3 hours to finish, but I will be including a short and medium scenario. All scenarios end with Potsdam, but you will be able to start later in the war if you only have 1 or 2 hours to play. In addition the game can be played with 3 or 2 players plus solitaire. I am very excited about the new Churchill and large scale playtesting will commence by the end of the month.

This was warfare in which most men were truly &quot;of iron&quot;, heavily and totally armored to such a point that their mobility was suspect. It was also the introduction of gunpowder &ndash; mostly field artillery &ndash; in noticeable numbers. And while many English men-at-arms were mounted, they did so almost entirely for transport. Most fighting was on foot &hellip; and it was quite vicious.<br/><br/>Historical Note: The game&rsquo;s title refers to the heavy casualty rates and the names given to many of the fields after the battles: Bloody Meadow, Bloody Field, et al. <br/><br/>Blood &amp; Roses is designed for quick learning and easy play. Game rules are short, there are no &quot;turns&quot; - play is Continual, with ample opportunities to steal play from your opponent - and combat resolution is a single dieroll. Playing time is about 1-2 hours, per battle.<br/><br/>Battles:<br/><br/>    1st St. Albans (22 May 1455) marks the first major engagement in the Wars of the Roses. Richard, Duke of York and his ally, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, defeated the Lancastrians under Edmund, Duke of Somerset, who was killed during the battle. York also captured Henry VI and forced Henry to appoint him Constable of England.<br/>    Blore Heath (23 September, 1459) where greatly outnumbered Yorkist infantry used the longbow and a defensive position to drive off the Lancastrian Men-at-Arms.<br/>    2nd St. Albans (17 February, 1461) where the Lancastrians drove the Yorkists out of the town and then destroyed Warwick&rsquo;s strangely deployed army, even when sturdily defended by hedges, caltrops and spiked netting.<br/>    Towton (29 March, 1461) is easily biggest battle in the box and the biggest in the entire series. It uses over 200 combat units and, much like the actual battle, will probably take a long time to play. It is mostly crash and bash, with little room for maneuver, all fought in a blinding snowstorm!!<br/>    Barnet (14 April, 1471) a classic battle of planned deployments, but overlapping wings, cries of treason in the lines, fog of war (actual fog), and the excellent use of reserves. <br/>    Tewksbury (4 May, 1471) a battle that shows one of the key terrain features of the battles in this era, extensive hedges and thick underbrush in otherwise clear fields.<br/>    Bosworth(22 August, 1485) the best-known battle of the wars and the tragic (I think) death of King Richard III in a battle he should have won.

The Russians had moved a column behind Gazan into Durenstein. His men, though victorious up to this point, were exhausted and nearly out of ammunition, with no relief in sight. Brigadier Jean Graindorge begged Marshal Mortier to escape the encirclement by boat to avoid capture or death. Mortier's answer was clear: &quot;No! We must not separate from these brave fellows; we must be saved or perish together!&quot; For most people, even veteran Napoleonic Grognards, the &ldquo;War of the Third Coalition&rdquo; has three distinct parts:<br/><br/>    Turning away from the aborted invasion of England, Napoleon takes his army on an astonishing force march, surprises Mack and much of the Austrian army at Ulm, and forces their surrender. <br/>    French capture Vienna, using sneaky tactics. <br/>    Big, decisive battle at Austerlitz. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Game over.<br/><br/>Austerlitz may have been Napoleon&rsquo;s classic battle, in his own estimation. It was certainly one &lsquo;title&rsquo; he refused to award to anyone else, though several of his marshals coveted being named &ldquo;Duke of Austerlitz&rdquo; or something. No, it was his masterpiece. But it was not the only battle of the war. And another one might have changed everything. While most of the French army is heading for strudel in Vienna, a newly slapped together corps - the VIII - is chasing the Austrians out of Bavaria, looking to snap up stragglers, loot, and also block anticipated Russian reinforcements from making it to the decisive battle for Vienna that Napoleon expected to fight. Newly created corps often have ragged organization, and such was the case here. While Marshal Edouard Mortier had an entire division of cavalry under his command, he allowed most of it to separate on its own mission and then allowed the tiny remnant to go adventuring also. In tactical terms, he was &ldquo;blind&rdquo; when he reached the town of Durenstein, perhaps most famous as having the castle where King Richard I had been held for ransom.<br/><br/>Commanding a Russian army much closer than Mortier realized was the wily Marshal Kutuzov, who was neither blind nor overconfident. He saw the overextended enemy advance as a chance to strike a blow and suckered the lead division into a valley between two heavy Russian columns. Not only had Mortier lost touch with his cavalry, but he allowed his three infantry divisions to become widely separated as well. He was marching with his lead Division, under T.M. Gazan, into a situation that might have been known as the &ldquo;Valley of Death&rdquo; fifty years before a spot in the Crimea earned that title. Kutuzov did not have everything his own way, however, as the columns he wished to attack with were exhausted, starving, and freezing&hellip;hardly in condition to be launching an assault. But they did, in a battle that lasted for hours and on into the night. &quot;We must not separate from these brave fellows; we must be saved or perish together!&quot; Gazan (and Mortier) would certainly have &ldquo;perished together&rdquo; had not the nearest support, Dupont&rsquo;s division, covered a day&rsquo;s march in half the time. The battle sputtered on into a freezing cold night before the Russians finally withdrew, even more miserable than they had been at the start.<br/><br/>Both sides claimed victory, but, with 60% casualties, Gazan wasn&rsquo;t very thrilled at the outcome, though he may have felt better about it when awarded the highest Legion of Honor. Mortier&rsquo;s reward was simply to be reassigned&hellip; although he would later have a distinguished career, both under Napoleon and the rulers who followed him, dying under bizarre circumstances that merit a story all their own.<br/><br/>Now this hardly-known battle - fought three weeks after Ulm and three weeks before Austerlitz - can be yours to explore. Step into Mortier&rsquo;s shoes, in a truly &ldquo;Against the Odds&rdquo; situation. When the battle starts, you are outnumbered 4-1 in infantry, 20-1 in guns, and &ldquo;lots&rsquo; to &ldquo;almost none&rdquo; in cavalry. But Kutuzov has challenges too. His men are exhausted and hard to get into motion. These Brave Fellows' game mechanics cover the difficulties of coordinating attacks (and fighting in the snow), and variable arrival times of the Russian columns and supporting French. Optional rules allow players to explore the &ldquo;what might have been&rdquo; situations that were so close to happening - both sides had additional troops who could have been involved (or could have gotten there a lot sooner than they did). Can you, as Marshal Kutuzov, thoroughly smash the arrogant French and increase the shaky confidence of the Third Coalition? Can you, as Marshal Mortier, do better than &ldquo;hold on&rdquo; with the last few survivors and lower the battered Russian army &lsquo;s morale even further?<br/><br/><br/>    Map - One full-color 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet<br/>    Counters - 216 full-color 9/16&quot; die-cut pieces<br/>    Rules length - 10 pages<br/>    Charts and tables - 2 pages<br/>    Complexity - Low<br/>    Solitaire suitability - Average<br/>    Playing time - Up to 3 hours<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"184144": "First Edition"}, "age": "14", "name": "These Brave Fellows", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "6.72692", "usersrated": "26", "boardgamefamily": {"134": "Magazine: Against The Odds"}}, "132086": {"rpgitemversion": {"275220": "3rd printing"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Playing at the World", "rpghonor": {"22681": "2013 Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming Nominee"}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1491228.jpg", "usersrated": "12", "rpgproducer": {"64399": "Jon Peterson"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1235": "Books about Roleplaying Games"}, "average": "9.25", "rpgcategory": {"2139": "Non-Game Book (but RPG Related)"}, "rpgpodcastepisode": {"114251": "Discussion 53: Further Discussion of the Gaming Commandments"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1491228_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Playing at the World attempts to shed light on the history of simulation in games, from the early beginnings of wargames in the 18th century to the invention and propagation of role-playing games that took place in the last quarter of the 20th century.<br/>Drawing from a very wide range of sources - some of them previously undocumented - the study discusses in detail the roots and transformative impact of fantasy gaming in modern culture.<br/><br/>"}, "132087": {"statistics": {}, "name": "T.R.M.G.S.

Then a gift of the same colour is loaded onto Max. If the next player rolls the same colour, he/she must push Max one full circle. If there is no gift left in that colour, the die is re-rolled.

Players collect armed forces cards and use them to conquer territories. Battles can be changed dramatically by special action cards that have a variety of effects, from helping your troops to bombing your enemies to smithereens. Ultimately, whoever gathers enough points by conquering territories and collecting victory point cards is declared the winner!<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing cards from the deck. When a territory is drawn, all the players join in to battle for it. The player who drew it declares a Theater of War -- Air, Land, or Sea -- and players deploy troops from their hands face down to hide their strength. (Individual troop cards range in strength from 1 to 5, so while other players can see how many cards you've laid down, they don't know how strong your forces are.)<br/><br/>Players can also play special cards, which increase the strength of one's forces, allow one to see other players' cards, let a player play a card from the discard pile, drop an A-Bomb on a territory to remove it from play altogether, or various other effects. When all players have committed as many forces they wish, all of the cards are revealed, special cards are resolved, and the player with the strongest remaining forces wins the territory.<br/><br/>The number of Victory Points required to win the game varies with the number of players participating. One gains a Victory Point for each territory held, as well as for each Victory Point card held in one's hand. The first player to accumulate the required number of Victory Points wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "132114": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Rifter (Issue 60 - Oct 2012)", "rpgproducer": {"16482": "Julius Rosenstein"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2431311.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"1954": "The Rifter"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"89298": "Coming Attractions"}, "rpg": {"341": "Heroes Unlimited"}, "rpgissueversion": {"267892": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2431311_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Rifter&reg; Number 60 is an extravaganza of source material that deals with the bizarre, gruesome and dangerous.

Constant Axis expansion, followed by steady Axis contraction, as the Allies recapture lost territory. In Europe, it is hard to pinpoint the transition point (a good barroom discussion any time!). In the Pacific, it is a little easier to focus precisely at the campaign where the Japanese tide of conquest began to ebb-- their unsuccessful campaign to take Port Moresby, the &quot;step too far.&quot;<br/><br/>What then represents the &quot;high tide&quot; of the Japanese Empire? That would be their successful conquest of the Dutch East Indies, one of their most strategically vital targets for the oil and rubber it could provide. A broad look at the record suggest the Japanese mostly had things their own way against the hasty &quot;ABDA&quot; alliance (American, British, Dutch, Australian), with its varied mix of modern and obsolete weapons and widely differing priorities. But a closer look shows that this was a much closer campaign, stretching the Japanese to complete. With a few breaks, the Allies might have held on.<br/><br/>Can you do better? Find out for yourself.<br/><br/>Forlorn Hopes covers the entire two-month campaign for the region, using a system that fully integrates air/sea/land operations. Derived from the popular titles &quot;Chennault's First Fight&quot; and &quot;Operation Cartwheel&quot; (both published by ATO), this game give both sides difficult choices in facing their different challenges.<br/><br/>The Allies are spread thin and facing multiple routes by which the enemy can attack. They know the maxim that &quot;those who defend everything defend nothing&quot; but deciding what NOT to hold is difficult. You must make the Japanese pay for every gain...<br/><br/>The Japanese face an enemy already in control of much of the battlefield and fighting with their backs to the wall. They have a schedule crunch and must weigh to benefits of using high cost assets to gain objectives. The cost of success at too high a price is long term failure (and who will tell the Emperor?).<br/><br/>BOTH players can choose to increase their available forces, representing greater emphasis in overall planning.

That would spread Axis troops out over the coast instead of concentrating them on the beaches of Normandy where the planned attack would happen. They started a disinformation plan called Operation Fortitude, designed to make Germany believe that an attack would occur to the south, in Calais; they went to the extent of staging massive radio traffic, constructing fake tanks out of wood, and leaking fake documents to known spies. The success of Operation Fortitude was so thorough that Hitler didn&rsquo;t believe it was a diversion until it was too late to send the troops stationed near Calais to help the defense of Normandy.<br/><br/>To aid in Operation Overlord, the actual Allied invasion bound for Normandy, French resistance groups managed to map and identify many emplacements and bunkers to help figure out the best locations to strike with their second distraction, Operation Rascal. The mission was designed to send Allied Talent Operation Groups through a portal (created by the famed Talent Pevnost) into France to cause as much damage and draw as much attention as possible, in an attempt to lure Axis forces from the fortifications on the beaches of Normandy.<br/><br/>From grocer trucks and foot traffic, the resistance managed to locate and map everything from factories, training grounds, munitions plants, communication centers, and even down to mortar and machine gun placements. Assigning targets to the squads best suited to take them out, General Eisenhower recruited TOG squads that totaled 350 men into Operation Rascal. The squads were chosen carefully; to put a squad into Operation Rascal was to pull them from the front line of Overlord.  The Talents that were picked were the ones with the most destructive, cunning, and elusive powers that would serve them well behind enemy lines but perhaps not so well on the beaches&mdash;super-spies, mesmerists, men who summoned viruses, speedsters who needed more of a runway than the scant few feet of a lander would give them&mdash;and those who served in their squads. Others were picked not because of their Talents but because whoever nominated them didn&rsquo;t want them to be killed on the sand of Omaha or Utah beach. Blatant and loud powers were picked alongside subtle ones, since the more attention the Rascals gathered as Talents, the more Ubermenschen would be pulled off of the front line to intervene.<br/><br/>"}, "132177": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Seeds Compilation: Fantasy I-V", "rpgproducer": {"18021": "Joseph Browning"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1446567.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"184432": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"1577": "Seeds"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1446567_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Welcome to the second Seeds Compilation!

In short, the perfect setting for a day out.&quot;<br/><br/>You and up to four friends must travel the length and breadth of the city looking for interesting things to do and see. And adventure can be found in the most unlikely places.<br/><br/>From the South Downs to Black Rock,the day is yours to spend as you please. You could explore the obvious sights or uncover hidden corners. You could stalk local celebrities or stumble upon resident legends. You could go busking or shopping, gambling or picnicking. You could be mugged in broad daylight or handed a flyer for the best party ever.<br/><br/>But you won&rsquo;t know till you dive in, so what are you waiting for?<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>Starting at Brighton train station, each player takes a coloured pawn and their first Destination card. This is where they're supposed to visit first to score the associated points, but there's nothing to say they can't just explore off the beaten track and find adventure that way as well. Either approach will score Anecdote Points, which are the currency and aim of the game - score 50 Anecdote Points and get back to Brighton station, and you've won.<br/><br/>Moving around the board either on foot or using public transport such as trains, buses and taxis, players can discover local characters, eccentrics, celebrities and city events - some of these are activated immediately, others act as subquests for the players to compete for. As well as these encounters, players can also go shopping for a variety of items that will help them or protect them from the dastardly tricks that'll be played on them through the course of the game via the Sneak cards deck players can accrue.<br/><br/>For instance, if you meet a local celebrity there's every chance another player will play a Lookalike card on you, so that celebrity was just a close likeness and therefore worth no points. If you trawl across the city to a destination miles away, a player may decide it's been closed for repairs. You might get a taxi only to be at the mercy of someone who doesn't know north from south, and end up streets away from where you intended.<br/><br/>Combining the skills of maze orientation, inventory and money management, player interaction and risk assessment, BN1 also relies on a healthy dose of luck. And with over 100 different encounters, 40 odd unique destinations, a brace of shop items and a couple of dozen different Sneak cards, it's an expansive adventure with a high replay value.<br/><br/><br/>The first edition of BN1, released at the start of November 2012, is a limited run of 500 hand-numbered copies.

Play your cards wisely to get rid of all the ghosts, undead, vampires, zombies and other spooky creatures haunting your mansion. Block your opponents while they're trying to drive spirits out of their home and into your backyard &ndash; but beware as the scariest ghosts will not be driven away so easily...<br/><br/>In game terms, your goal in Ghooost! is to get rid of all of your cards in hand and in your mansion by playing a card (or several matching cards) equal to or higher than the one(s) played previously. To set up, each player has four ghost cards in hand and 4-12 cards in his mansion. Ghost cards come in four suits and have values ranging from 1 to 14, with a few cards having special powers; scary (red) ghosts, for example, can be topped only by fearless ghosts, other scary ghosts, or a ghost quartet, while fearless ghosts can be played no matter what's on top of the Cemetery (discard pile).<br/><br/>A game consists of two stages. In the first stage, players draw or play cards to prepare their hand of cards for the second stage. On a turn, a player takes one of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Play one or more matching cards on the Cemetery equal to or higher than the cards played previously, then refill your hand to four cards by drawing from the Crypt (deck).<br/>    Take all the cards from the Cemetery into your hand; any card can be played on an empty Cemetery.<br/>    Draw one card from the Crypt and try to play it, taking all the cards from the Cemetery into your hand if the play isn't valid.<br/><br/><br/>Once the Crypt is empty, the second stage begins and players take turns either playing valid cards into the Cemetery or taking all cards from the Cemetery into their hand. If a player plays two or three matching ghosts, he takes another turn immediately; if he plays four cards that match (or plays cards that complete a quartet), those cards and the Cemetery are removed from play, then he takes another turn. If a player's hand is empty, he draws the top card from his mansion, playing it if valid and taking all the Cemetery cards into his hand if not. If a player empties his hand and mansion, he's out and the others keep playing. Play continues until only one player has cards in hand; this player loses the game and everyone else wins.<br/><br/>Ghooost! includes a scoring system that allows for multiple rounds.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"227023": "Czech first edition"}, "average": "5.72933", "name": "Ghooost!", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "780", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"19023": "Holidays: Halloween"}}, "132252": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Spot: The Cool Adventure", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"184619": "North American Game Boy edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2319": "Cartoon"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4422": "Game Boy"}, "poll": {}, "description": "A 2-D platformer featuring the mascot of 7-Up soft drinks, Spot.

Both sides exclusively use (aside from Odin) soldier pieces ('Einherjar' or 'Giants' in the game) that move like a Rook in chess, and take opposing pieces by moving such that the opposing piece is trapped directly between two of the moving player's pieces.<br/><br/>In addition to a recreation of Hnefatfl, the game includes a campaign of sorts, called 'Ragnarok', played against increasingly difficult opponents.  Ragnarok differs from basic King's Table by allowing each player to replace four of their basic soldiers with unique pieces chosen from a list of six.  While the pieces available to each side are functionally identical, they are named relative to the side that they are on, (Tyr, Thor and so on for Valhalla; Loki, Garm and so on for Darkness).

The idea is simple: it's a basic N-in-a-row game where the row is allowed to have a single bend in it.  Put another way, the row can change direction once, anywhere along it's length.  The angle of the bend formed can be right, or obtuse, but not acute.<br/><br/>The introduction of a Kink has two effects which I believe will make the game richer and more strategic (consistent with my experience of the first few plays):<br/><br/>1. The number of degrees of freedom in the winning pattern is much higher for Kink than for the equivalent standard N-in-a-row game.<br/>   2. The number of stones in a row required for winning must be larger.<br/><br/>To write the rule set, I modified the rules to Connect 6, which is to my mind the most canonical (and one of the best) N-in-a-row games.<br/><br/>Kink is a game for 2 players, played with a Go set.<br/><br/>1. The board begins empty.  One player owns the black stones and the other owns the white.<br/>   2. To begin, Black places a single stone on any empty space.<br/>   3. From then on, starting with White, each player places 2 stones per turn.<br/>   4. The first player to form a row of 9-in-a-row wins.  The row may have up to one Kink in it, which may form a right or obtuse angle (but not an acute angle).  Rows may run both orthogonally and diagonally.<br/><br/>Note: I don't yet know if 9 is the right number.  If it's not 9, it's probably 8.

Shuffle the cards and deal five to each player face down. The remaining cards are placed face down.<br/>This is the draw pile. Turn over the top card and place it adjacent to the draw pile. This is the start of the discard pile.<br/>2.    Choose a starting player, play follows in a clockwise direction.<br/>3.    The starting player chooses one of their cards and places it face up onto the discard pile. Each card shows a Dandy or Beano character inside a coloured border. The chosen card must show either the same character or the same coloured border as the one below it in the pile. Play then passes to the next player.<br/>4.    Any player who is unable to play a card on their turn must take the top card from the draw pile and add it to their hand. Play then passes to the next player.<br/>5.    When a Roger the Dodger cord is played, the following player must pick up two cards from the draw pile and add them to their hand. Play then passes to the next player. However, a player does not have to pick up two cards if they can also play a Roger the Dodger card on top. In this case, the next player must pick up two cards instead. Play then passes to the next player.<br/>6.    When a Desperate Dan card is played, the following player must miss a turn.<br/>7.    If the draw pile runs out, the discard pile is shuffled and turned face down. The top card is then turned over to restart as in '3'.<br/>8.    The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "132425": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1443631.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"138072": {"name": "Snowdonia: Lost Train Promo Card"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1086": {"name": "Tony Boydell"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"1086": "Tony Boydell"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1443631_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "There are 4 Promo cards released for Snowdonia.<br/><br/>These are:<br/><br/>1) Ivor the Engine<br/>2) Jimmy and the Little Old Engine<br/>3) llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch   <br/>   station<br/>4) A new action space - Snowdonia<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"185101": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.03391", "name": "Snowdonia: Essen 2012 Promo Cards", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2082": "Worker Placement"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "87", "boardgamefamily": {"13106": "Country: Wales"}}, "132426": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1475002.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1727": {"name": "Bruno Cathala"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": {"11886": "Julien Delval"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1027": {"name": "Days of Wonder"}}, "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1475002_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "Two Promo cards are available for the Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game.

It is the Blade Runner's job to shoot to kill, upon detection, any trespassing Replicant. However, it is possible that any one of the Blade Runners may become a fugitive Sympathizer and attempt to escape the city with one or more Replicants.<br/><br/>In the game, players move about the city by rolling a die and moving any amount of spaces up to the number rolled, in any direction. Players investigate locations from the film by drawing cards, and test Suspects using the Voight-Kampff empathy test from the film. If a Suspect is revealed to be a Replicant the Blade Runner must engage it in combat, and later on, the players' characters will likely end up fighting against each other.<br/><br/>There are three ways to win the game:<br/><br/><br/>     Retire more Replicants than any other Blade Runner.<br/>     Escape from the city as a Sympathizer.<br/>     Be the last player whose character is still alive.<br/><br/><br/>The rules, cards, counters, board, and assembly instructions can all be found in the 'Web Links' section, below.

She has to deliver the mail to the bear, the two lions and the three elephants, bring them food or paint the animal houses. And Dapdap, the penguin, has escaped from his enclosure and visits all his animal friends. Can you help Milly with her tasks and return Dapdap to his enclosure?<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- 1 board<br/>- 18 tiles (9x food, 3x flags, 3x paint bucket, 3x letters)<br/>- 16 task tiles<br/>- 1 wooden &quot;Milly, the animal keeper&quot; token<br/>- 1 wooden &quot;Dapdap, the penguin&quot; token<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>For the basic variant, 6 food tiles are removed from the game. 3 food tiles (showing 1 honeypot, 2 pieces of meet, 3 lettuce heads) and flag, paint bucket and letter tiles are put close to the corresponding corners of the board. The task tiles are randomised and stacked face-down. Dapdap is placed on the penguin enclosure.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The start player takes the Milly token and puts it in front of him/herself to show it is his/her turn. He/she draws a task card. If it is a Milly card, he/she gets to help Milly. He/she looks which house (red, yellow or blue roof) Milly is running to and if she is delivering the mail, carrying the paint bucket, a flag, or if she is distributing food. He/she then looks for the correct tile at the board corners and puts it in the corresponding area on the board and gets to keep the task tile as a reward. <br/>&quot;Correct&quot; means: matching colour for the paint buckets, matching shape for the flags (shape on the flag has to match the shape of the animal enclosure), matching number for the letters, and matching food (honey for the bear, meat for the lions, lettuce heads for the elephants).<br/>If the tile drawn is a Dapdap card, the active player puts the Dapdap token to the next animal enclosure. Dapdap greets the animals in their language, so the player makes the corresponding sounds. For the correct greeting, they also get to keep the tile.<br/>After completing the task, Milly is given to the next player, whose turn then starts. Incorrectly completed tasks are put at the bottom of the task tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends either when Dapdap has returned to his enclosure or when all items have been distributed (players decide which of the two they prefer). The game is intended to be played cooperatively, without deciding on a winner (but it can be played competitively by counting how many tiles each player has earned).<br/><br/>The advanced variant is played with all the food tiles and the players have to choose the tile showing the same number as food items as there are animals of that type, e.g. if Milly is going to feed the elephants, the player has to pick the food tile that shows three lettuce heads because there are three elephants.<br/><br/>"}, "132490": {"rpg": {"586": "Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Wake: The Second Creed of Pandemonium", "rpgproducer": {"22764": "Rafael Chandler"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3175671.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"185233": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3175671_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>It was a monstrous thing, composed of dark iron and fire, covered in spikes, sharp angles on its body gleaming with razor's edges.

He is certainly a fun and versatile Master to play, and if you decide to start a Marcus Crew, his wide choice of minions inevitably ends up encouraging you to expand to additional Masters, since you'll have the models to form the foundation of those crews.<br/><br/>"}, "132499": {"poll": {}, "name": "Malifaux: Body Thieves", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "yearpublished": "0", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1457080_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10053": {"name": "Wyrd Miniatures"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1457080.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"185247": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "expands": {"52328": {"name": "Malifaux"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This set expands the Malifaux universe by adding the Body Thieves crew.

L.J. bring a Cache of 4-Stones. The max number of Soulstones you can bring at a standard game is only 8, meaning you will have to lose 2 of the 10 Soulstones you have). To avoid doing this, pick up the Scales of Justice, or a different 2-stone Totem.<br/><br/>"}}
