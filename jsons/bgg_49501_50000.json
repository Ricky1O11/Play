What is out there in the dark? What hidden dangers lie within the forest, over those mountains, across that ocean? As the empire expanded, it encountered and absorbed new lands. These areas were filled with new people, speaking their own languages, with their own customs, gods, and mysteries. Just beyond the borders lurked evil entities.<br/><br/>Forces older than our world had dwelled in these places millennia before the arrival of mankind. For their own safety, the local peoples eventually formed legends, myths, and taboos around them. These whispered tales of dread and horror kept people from stumbling into the lairs or paths of these dark and ancient forces.<br/><br/>Unfortunately these safeguards were seen as ignorant barbaric superstitions by the new Roman settlers and masters. As the native people slowly became more and more like their Roman conquerors, the old ways were slowly forgotten &hellip; but that didn&rsquo;t make the danger go away.<br/><br/>Occasionally these loathsome, powerful, and malignant beings would be disturbed by the unwitting, unknowing, or unbelieving.

These murders are big news in the media because rumors tell about how the heads of the victims have been severed.

Advertisements for &ldquo;The First Annual Willowton Halloween Festival&rdquo; have been placed in many area newspapers.

Cash prizes are being offered for the best costume, as well as for anyone who can &ldquo;beat&rdquo; the cornrow maze.

Upon every ocean a ship hoisting the Union Jack and armed with sixteen-inch guns, able to blow any other navy out of the water, slips through cold grey surf. An empire&rsquo;s laws and language, economics, sports and culture have diffused across a malleable globe. Pax Britannica holds sway.<br/><br/>But the veneer is beginning to crack. A lost generation lies under the killing fields of Ypres and Passchendale, the survivors scarred, lost, and forgotten. Ireland burns with fury and fire as the war for independence rages. Up north, trade unions threaten to bring down the government, while communist sympathisers foment paranoia in Fleet Street&rsquo;s newspapers. From across the channel European fascism whispers sweet nothings to middle and working-class disillusioned. And beneath it all something dark twists; something immeasurably old and unfathomable. Its eldritch pulse beats through a society of Bright Young Things and dole-queue miners. This is the time of spiritualism, esoterica and occultism; of wild abandon and lost morals; of dark sects and darker arts. After the mechanical horrors of the War to End All Wars, man no longer fears the primordial nature of the universe&ndash;and there are those who will use this to their gain.<br/><br/>Kingdom of the Blind is a guidebook for the United Kingdom between 1920 and 1930.

It is &ldquo;In his house at R&rsquo;lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming&rdquo;. For a time the Roman Empire stretched across most of the &ldquo;known world&rdquo; uniting various peoples under its rule. Cultures met, clashed, were conquered and changed one another in the processes. Information traveled along Roman roads along with goods and troops, spreading knowledge and enlightenment throughout the empire. Rome, for some, meant civilization, order and justice. For others it meant enslavement, oppression and occupation. It was the crest of history&rsquo;s tide, and when it was gone darkness and chaos reigned for nearly a thousand years. But for now the Roman Empire was a light that kept the dark ages at bay, but with every light there are always shadows.<br/><br/>Amid sprawling cities and frontier garrisons, from peaceful country villas to newly constructed catacombs the forces of the Cthulhu Mythos lurked, and thrived. As the Empire spread across the land the Mythos infected it, like an illness, using Rome&rsquo;s uniting light to spread its own darkness. Isolated covens and cabals of dozens soon became well-organized cults of hundreds, spread across vast stretches of the empire. The accumulated knowledge of the ages was examined, connections made and puzzles solved, sometimes to humanity&rsquo;s misfortune. The forces of the mythos quickly learned that civilization was as easy to hide in as wastelands but with much more abundant prey.<br/><br/>However, in every age there are always a few who learn the truth. A small handful of people always seem to discover that all is not as it seems and slowly pull back the veil of what mankind tells itself is reality. They see, they learn, and usually they die; but not always. Some take up arms, be it blades or arcane magic, and choose to stand against these shadows. They become mankind&rsquo;s defenders, fighting to protect others from the truth while moving to rid the world of these shadows of evil. In every age there are always a few such people, it was no different in the time of the Roman Empire. Here are a few of their stories.

A year when the rains are light famine reigns. The average lifespan in Sudan during the Gaslight period was 33, which is similar to modern times. Widespread famine led to desperation, theft, murder, cruelty and, in some cases, madness.<br/><br/>It was a time when the simple son of a boat builder, who grew up to become a charismatic Sunni Muslim scholar named Muhammed Ahmed, became a self-proclaimed Mahdi. He led Sudan into a rebellion against its Egyptian and British occupiers and plunged the country into years of fanaticism and bloodshed. In short, this is a perfect setting for a Call of Cthulhu scenario or campaign.<br/><br/>Contact with the outside world throughout its history has been sporadic and mainly from invaders pushing through from Egypt up the Nile valley to gather slaves and ivory. Sudan also has a long tradition of trade with many countries including merchants from China dating back to the 8th century. Records indicate that the early Chinese traders called the country of Sudan Molin-guo. In the early 1800&rsquo;s the area was unmapped and as unknown to Europeans as the uncharted areas of central Asia. Much of the early exploration was dedicated to finding the source of the Nile. If it could be dammed, and the flow regulated, an area greater than the size of Europe could be controlled.<br/><br/>During the late 19th century noted Egyptologist E.A. Wallis Budge found evidence that the Egyptians had contact with Sudan and the people of the upper reaches of the Nile as early as 4300 B.C. Tomb paintings indicate trade for elephant ivory, slaves and what may have been central African pygmies brought before the Pharaoh to dance for him. The pygmies would have been captured by slave raiding parties from Sudan into the area known today as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<br/><br/>The closing years of the 19th century witnessed a great deal of turmoil throughout the British Empire. One of the major events of that period that is not widely remembered today was centered in Sudan. An Englishman named Charles &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; Gordon became a darling of the British public who followed every news report. He had been sent to Sudan to arrange for the evacuation of Egyptian and British citizens before a fanatical Muslim group took total control of the country. Gordon was a very devout Christian and did not want to see an extreme form of Islam take over and dominate Sudan. He also felt a strong sense of duty towards the people that he had been sent to evacuate and could not bring himself to leave just to save his own life.<br/><br/>After his death at the siege of Khartoum at the hands of the forces of the Mahdi, Sudan was plunged into thirteen years of chaos. Gordon&rsquo;s death was finally avenged after a long military campaign led by Major-General Horatio Kitchener that advanced through the Nile valley all the way to Omdurman.<br/><br/>Within this monograph I will present historical information and will denote Cthulhu mythos information in distinctive text boxes.<br/><br/>The focus of this monograph will be on the gaslight era of the late 19th century.

The Sagas take place across Scandinavia and what will later be known as Nova Scotia.<br/><br/>Players will be taking the roles of the crew of a small knorr (a Viking longship). While pre-generated characters are provided keepers may allow players to create their own. These characters will have many adventures during the Sagas, honing their skills as they face countless challenges. Investigator&rsquo;s skills may well increase from scenario to scenario; status and the characters' ages definitely will. Investigators will be sailing dangerous waters and battling deadly adversaries, some may not survive. Provisions are written in to allow &ldquo;replacement&rdquo; crew to be recruited between voyages.<br/><br/>The Havamal &mdash; First recorded from the oral tradition around 1200 AD by Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson, The Havamal is a collection of Old Norse poems. These short poetic verses, said to be handed down from Odin himself, gives us a window into the life, values and warrior traditions of Scandinavian culture during &ldquo;The Viking Age&rdquo; (790 &ndash;1070 AD). It is part of a larger collection of pre-Christian lore called The Poetic Edda, which includes many stories from Norse Mythology. Pieces of The Havamal are sprinkled throughout this book, as well as other, more modern works where appropriate.<br/><br/>The Viking People &mdash; During the Viking Age no one, not even the Scandinavian peoples themselves or rest of world, used the term Viking. Scandinavia was without a central ruler, a patchwork of small semi-independent kingdoms long before the formation of countries like Norway, Sweden or Denmark. Outsiders referred to these northern seafaring peoples by many different names. The Irish called them Gaill (Foreigners), the Slavs and Greeks called them Rus, the Arabs called them Majus, the Anglo-Saxons called them Danes and the Franks called them Normanni (Northmen). Of all these varied names Northmen is the term used through this book when referring to native Scandinavian peoples during the Viking Era.<br/><br/>The Saga of the Ravenar &mdash; The sagas of the Ravenar are three adventures that take place in Norway, Iceland, Greenland and Vinland, between the years 989 AD and 1002 AD. The scenarios began with &ldquo;The Unsung Saga&rdquo;, a short high action demo posted on the Chaosium Missionary website just after the release of Cthulhu Dark Ages. The following scenarios kept to the theme of high action horror. Players expecting to read ancient tomes in monastery libraries while carefully unraveling a mystery are in for a shock.

If their mind fails them, their characters become mentally unstable.<br/><br/>Ravenstone Sanitarium offers an alternative style of play to Call of Cthulhu.

Each character represents a different part of the main character&rsquo;s mind due to multiple personality disorder.<br/><br/>After players make a Sanity check, a Personality Check is made as well. This decides which personality has suddenly taken control of the body. At that point, the players set aside their current character sheet and pick up the new character sheet.<br/><br/>The first of two scenarios will place the players in the heart of a mental hospital having lost all memory of who they are or where they came from.

There is no plausible way (we can see) of linking the scenarios into a campaign, but this is the idea: the situation of war is ideal for one-shot scenarios.<br/><br/>International conflict is a background particularly conducive to Mythos horror as the urgencies of survival in war create opportunities to both mask and heighten the sanity-blasting effects of contact with the Mythos. These scenarios avoid battle-fronts, but place the investigators in risky situations where their own decisions determine success or failure, life and death.<br/><br/>Each scenario contains pre-generated characters for easy playability, or, for those who prefer not to use them, an indication of the scope for role-playing the scenarios provide. The scenarios are variously designed to play out in one, two, or three sessions of play though the keeper will be a better judge of how long they might take for their group.

An abode of great age with its rotting fa&ccedil;ade and long-lost, eldritch secrets hidden inside, beneath decades of cobwebs and dust? Does it require spine-chilling drafts and creaking wood that causes stalwart investigators to calm their breathing in nervous anxiety? Or perhaps it is a house hand-built by skilled and discreet craftsmen who don&rsquo;t mind an eccentric owner's request for a secret passageway or hidden room?<br/><br/>The ideal haunted house seems to issue from the 18th and 19th centuries. Nothing adds to a supernatural mystery than an old abandoned house, whether standing on some lonely country back road or in the middle of the big city. Where once a stately manor stood on a rural estate may now be rotting amidst a sprawling suburb.<br/><br/>Every small town has such an old abandoned house, inspiring local folklore with its spooky, mysterious past and its supposed horrors still lurking inside. Elderly neighbors whisper hushed rumors about previous owners, and what horrors occurred. Youngsters dare each other to enter; teenagers use them for reckless (or romantic) adventures; unknowing and long-lost relatives inherit them; and sinister persons (or things) use them as headquarters for nefarious plans.<br/><br/>Keepers of Unknown Lore are welcome to tweak the designs presented here, adding more secret doors and passages, and strange landscaping to whatever neighborhood they wish to place their own haunted house. Does your scenario need an organ loft where mysterious music flows forth at midnight? A Victorian-era tower turret is perfect. A hidden basement room where once Revolutionaries, Criminals, or Cults secretly met?

Once the capital of Cardolan, Tharbad has become the object of contention for all who would seek hegemony in southern Eriador.<br/> * BREE - Partake of the rustic hospitality and parochial charm of the Bree-landers, whether at the common room of the King's Rest Inn, or amid the pastoral serenity of the surrounding farmlands that soften the sometimes grim landscape of war-torn Eriador.<br/> * BARROW-DOWNS - Dare to tread among the grassy mounds that house the remains of Arnor's past kings and their Eriadorian forefathers, now infested by the evil spirits know as the &quot;barrow-wights&quot;.<br/> * BANNERS OF THE HIGH KING - Join the Elven-king Gil-galad's banner-bearers on their perilous trek across the breadth of Eriador, carrying pledge of their lord's support for the Last Alliance of Men and Elves against Sauron.

It was too late to stop the chaos her erstwhile ally had wrought when he chose to strike off on his own, including this Mamoud-forsaken war, but she could limit future damage. He was a fool if he thought his newfound friends in Valeria could protect him. It was a delicious irony that the emergency powers that that ensured his contiued tenure would soon strengthen her position.<br/><br/> &quot;You're right, Chief.
