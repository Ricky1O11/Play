Each card in the deck has a numerical attack strength and an attack pattern which will be familiar to Chess players. However, unlike Chess, the eight Pawn cards have different attack strengths. The number one pawn is called the Ace and can be used in special attacks.<br/><br/>The game combines mainly strategic thinking with an element of luck, and some bluffing. In most turns, one card is taken from each player. Formulating an attack which takes more than one card, or a defence where no cards are lost, is a key strategic element of the game.<br/><br/>There are four game modes for 2, 3 and 4 players, plus a collaborative Alliance mode where two pairs team up against each other.<br/><br/>Unlike some other Chess variants which use cards to modify the traditional game of Chess, Check is a stand-alone card game.

It was not an idle boast.<br/><br/>Napoleon's Grande Armee mustered 75,000 men, well-led, superbly trained, and completely confident of victory. And the next day, they would win the most decisive victory of Napoleon's career.<br/><br/>The Battle of Austerlitz was Napoleon's tactical masterpiece. Facing an Allied army 72,000 men strong, he blocked a massive Allied flanking movement aimed at his right wing, launched an attack that smashed the Allied center, and then scattered the remnants so thoroughly that by the night of December 2nd the Allied Third Coalition was in ruins.<br/><br/>The battle contained many moments of high drama: the French right wing holding on despite 3-to-1 odds, desperately waiting for help from Davout's corps rushing to the battlefield after an epic forced march; a massive cavalry melee fought on the northern half of the field between the opposing cavalry reserves; the clash of the French and Russian Imperial Guards on the Pratzen Heights that decided the course of the battle.<br/><br/>Austerlitz 1805 is a detailed wargame, on a tactical level, with infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries, featuring...<br/><br/>1) A chit-based Command system where players randomly draw command chits to determine which division or corps may activate at that moment -- activation is not automatic. Commanders must roll to activate when their chit is drawn, and missing the die-roll leads to the Command Breakdown Table -- disasters can happen.<br/><br/>2) A Combat system that includes all of the detail that fans of Napoleonic tactics know and love. All of the formations are there -- line, column, skirmish -- each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Players will soon learn that proper unit interaction is crucial for victory, with artillery wearing down the enemy line, infantry creating a breakthrough, and cavalry exploiting the breakthrough with a thundering charge.<br/><br/>3) Special units and rules to add a distinctive historical flavor: the Tirailleurs Po and Tirailleurs Corse, elite battalions of French skirmishers; the exotic Mamelukes of the French Imperial Guard, matched against the Russian Cossacks; the fearsome French Grand Battery; the early morning Fog that blanketed the battlefield and so bedeviled the battle's opening moves.<br/><br/>4) Six scenarios -- two full-battle scenarios; three smaller one or two map scenarios covering the significant actions, plus a learning scenario providing an introduction to the game's mechanics.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE 20 minutes per turn <br/>MAP SCALE 150 yards per hex <br/>UNIT SCALE infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"122093": "First Edition"}, "name": "Austerlitz 1805: Napoleon's Greatest Victory", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "88", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "average": "5.76989"}, "8572": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Jumble", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic276193_t.jpg", "average": "4.93333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"553": {"name": "Cadaco"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic276193.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"21744": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1025": {"name": "Word Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This release of JUMBLE differs almost completely from its predecessors.

Chapter F also provides rules for the special climatic conditions that were so much a part of desert combat, such as dust, heat haze and sun blindness.<br/><br/>Of the five mounted mapboards in WEST OF ALAMEIN, four (#s 26-29) depict flat open desert, with the dominant terrain features on separate, moveable overlays so as to maximize flexibility. The fifth board (#25) represents a rugged hill mass as is found in Tunisia, and can be converted to a large escarpment by means of an overlay specially designed for this purpose.<br/><br/>A Design-Your-Own system for the random selection and placement of overlays is also provided, which in combination with the vehicle and weapon point values, historical notes and DYO charts, will provide an endless variety of situations for those who enjoy creating their own scenarios. And as if all this weren&rsquo;t enough, simple rules have been included to enable the desert boards and overlays to represent the steppes of the Ukraine, providing added flexibility for these components.

But HOLLOW LEGIONS is certainly not limited to the desert; indeed, of the eight scenarios in this module, five are set in Europe.  <br/>Also included are the ASL Chapter H (Design Your Own) Italian vehicle and weapon listings, point values, historical notes and DYO charts - plus the ASL Chapter N (Armory) pages for the countersheets in HOLLOW LEGIONS, those for the Allied and Axis Minor infantry and support weapons, and those for British ordnance and transport.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Board 30, 31<br/>Chapter H Italian<br/>Scenarios 51 - 58<br/>3 Counter Sheets<br/><br/>Scenario List<br/><br/>ASL Scenario 51     The Taking of Takrouna<br/>ASL Scenario 52     Too Little, Too Late<br/>ASL Scenario 53     A High Price to Pay<br/>ASL Scenario 54     Bridge to Nowhere<br/>ASL Scenario 55     Retribution<br/>ASL Scenario 56     Half a Chance<br/>ASL Scenario 57     The Battle for Rome<br/>ASL Scenario 58     Ci Arrendiamo<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"78825": "First Edition"}, "average": "7.85126", "name": "Hollow Legions: ASL Module 7", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "358", "boardgameaccessory": {"183950": "Advanced Squad Leader: ASL Map Bundle"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"62": "Advanced Squad Leader"}}, "8609": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic35692.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"135895": "Rising Sun: ASL Module 13"}, "is_expanded_by": {"163320": {"name": "ASL Action Pack #10"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"76": {"name": "Don Greenwood"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1992", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"2652": "Charles Kibler"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5": {"name": "The Avalon Hill Game Co"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic35692_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"22410": "1991 Charles S.

You've experienced paradrops, glider-borne landings, Stuka attacks and opposed river crossings. Only one major type of WW2 land combat remains unexplored:   the classic amphibious assault. Now, in GUNG HO!, this too is added to the combat repertoire of ASL. And what better way to present assault landings than with the introduction of the U.S.Marines. GUNG HO! offers four types of U.S.M.C. squads, reflecting their evolution through the war years, along with the most comprehensive tactical-level amphibious assault rules ever offered in a wargame.<br/><br/>It is all here in the balance of Chapter G: deep and shallow ocean, beaches of variable width and slope, sea walls, piers, beach obstacles, reefs, heavy surf, naval gunfire, and all the important types of landing craft used by the Allies and Japan throughout the war.  As if this weren't enough, GUNG HO! also introduces rules and counters for the infamous cave defenses employed by the Japanese, plus new infantry counters for the early U.S. Army in the Phillipines and the entire order of battle of the Chinese Army.

The card is removed and all players see the letter underneath. This letter is written down and the number card replaced. The player then chooses another number revealing another letter in the same way. The letters revealed are written in the order they are revealed and must have the possibility of making a word. If a word is possible the player may continue to choose numbers and revealing letters. If a complete word is formed the player gets ten points per letter added to their score and may start over trying to make another word.

There are elements here from backgammon, pachisi, Careers, you name it.<br/><br/>The vague back story has players controlling &quot;agents&quot; that move about the board &quot;...in your struggle against the odds to obtain money, prisoners, and position&quot;.<br/><br/>The square gameboard is printed with four concentric rings of spaces.  Each turn players roll two dice to move one of their three tokens - pardon me, &quot;agents&quot; - out of their headquarters on the outer ring and around the board.  Agents can be sent back to HQ by enemy agents, can form blockades, can fall into traps and be captured, and in general are used to make money and harass the other agents.<br/><br/>Most squares are marked with actions that kick off when agents land on them.  Many of these earn money for the players, either as a flat payment or by allowing a simple form of gambling involving the bank and the other players.  Other actions include: allowing movement up to the next inner track, drawing &quot;Fate&quot; cards that dole out random goodness and badness, starting an auction that sells fallen agents to the highest bidders, and traps that may be inconveniently activated by other players.<br/><br/>The rings get progressively more generous and dangerous as agents move to the inside.  Agents captured by an opponent's action (rather than a game mechanic) don't re-enter the game, so the number of agents in play gradually diminishes.  The game ends when only one player's agents are left on the board.  Players sell (ransom, I suppose) their captured prisoners, and the most money wins the game.<br/><br/>This appears to be a limited run home brew, but it comes in a sturdy box and the production values are good.  Both the &quot;Regular Play&quot; and &quot;Advanced Play&quot; rules booklets are well-organized and pretty clear.  Advanced rules include solitaire, partnership and a host of other variants.<br/><br/>"}, "8702": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic43769.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"720": {"name": "Kevin Zucker"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1994", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"3439": "Rick Barber"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"94": {"name": "Clash of Arms Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic43769_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": {"1051": {"name": "Napoleonic"}}, "description": "(from Clash of Arms website:)<br/><br/>1807 - The Russians have abandoned Warsaw with the French in hot pursuit.

Unlike many other games set in the period, Flying Colors provides a simple, fast-playing system allowing players to re-enact battles containing dozens of ships on each side.  Rather than focusing on the abilities of individual ships, Flying Colors uses broad classes of vessel within each &quot;rate&quot; and concentrates the players minds on maintaining command of their fleets using a simple command system.<br/><br/>From the Publisher:<br/>Flying Colors recreates naval actions during the height of the Age of Sail, from small engagements to full battles involving dozens of ships in each fleet. Play is fast, furious, and does not require the pre-plotted movement found in many other naval games. Instead, a simple initiative and command system allows players to activate and maneuver their fleets in a realistic manner, indicating how older commanders adhered to rules of engagement where more forward thinking commanders, like Nelson, could retain control of their fleets after the first broadsides began to be exchanged.<br/><br/>This is not a strategic level game where one piece represents several ships. Flying Colors includes 300 individually named ships rated for size, gunnery, boarding ability, and damage capacity. Also included are nearly four dozen individually named commanders, rated for their ability to control their formations as well as the impact of their presence within the fleet. The game system provides what naval enthusiasts will expect in a tactical Age of Sail game: broadsides, rakes, anchoring, wind effects, weather, shore batteries, and much more. All this is packed into a short, accessible rulebook.<br/><br/>Included within the game are 17 historical scenarios ranging from the Battle of Minorca (1756) during the Seven Years War to the Battle of the Capes during the American Revolution and on through the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) during the Napoleonic Wars. The battles range in size from small engagements playable on a single map through huge engagements like the Glorious First of June playable on three maps. Players are also free to create their own variants and &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios using point values for each ship. Most scenarios can be played within a few hours and two players can complete even the largest within a day. Several are also well suited to solitarie play.<br/><br/>You can now recreate Nelson's glory with Flying Colors!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"86278": "GMT Games English first edition 2005"}, "maxplaytime": "240", "average": "7.42738", "name": "Flying Colors", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "612", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"9793": "Age of Kings"}}, "8731": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic36384.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"96208": {"name": "Gallipolli, 18 march 1915"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1856": {"name": "Michael Scott Smith"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1992", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"36537": "Claus Bergen"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"489": {"name": "3W (World Wide Wargames)"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic36384_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1008": {"name": "Nautical"}}, "description": "This is a simulation of battleship combat, which abstracts each ship to four numeric attributes: attack, defense, speed and range.<br/>What you get is one 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheet, big enough to fight large encounters like the fleet action at Jutland. 400 &frac12;&quot; die cut counters, a 12-page rule-book and two dice.

The scale is 6 miles per hex and three days per turn.  Units (blue Germans and brown Soviets) are predominantly divisions. The Soviets have a few corps, and some German mechanized divisions are replaced by kampfgruppen if eliminated in combat. Though they have &quot;historical&quot; designations, the formations are pretty generic. They display combat factors, movement allowances and NATO symbols. Most formidable are the German 6-8 panzer divisions; most common are the lowly Soviet 1-4 infantry.<br/><br/>Games can begin as early as September 30, 1941, and end as late as December 31st. A variety of starting points, ending points and German orders of battle produce 24 scenarios, four lasting all 31 turns, the rest - centered on the German offensives in early October and late November and the Soviet riposte at the end of the year - 8 turns each.<br/><br/>The four-color map is functional though not an aesthetic gem. It shows cities, rivers, railroads, forests, swamps, lakes, Soviet fortifications and scenario start lines.<br/><br/>Players alternate turns, each having a movement phase, combat phase and second movement phase for mechanized units. Zones of control are &quot;semi-active&quot; (requiring extra movement points to enter or leave but not mandating combat between adjacent enemies). The stacking limit is three units of any size per hex.<br/><br/>The Combat Results Table has the classic Eliminate, Exchange, Retreat outcomes. Overruns during movement are also possible, though they require 11 to 1 odds. Germans must trace supply lines to railroads that have been converted by Eisenbahn Bautruppen, Soviets to unconverted rail lines that run to the north, south or east of the map. Lack of supply halves movement and combat factors but doesn't, by itself, result in elimination.<br/><br/>Weather changes historically. Rain, mud and full winter successively erode movement allowances and combat strengths.<br/><br/>There are no air or command rules.<br/><br/>Victory points are awarded for destroying enemy units and for geographical objectives (possession of Moscow for either side, proximity to Moscow for the Germans, pushing units west of the start line for the Soviets).<br/><br/>When published, this was one of SPI's largest and most sophisticated games.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 days<br/>Hex: 6 miles / 9.6 kilometers<br/>Units: Brigade to Corps<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; four-color mapsheet<br/>One single-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 10-page foldout Moscow Campaign folder<br/>One 6-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-4 hours<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"107258": "SPI First Edition"}, "name": "The Moscow Campaign", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "6.50612", "usersrated": "49", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"18618": "Cities: Moscow"}}, "8755": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic62578.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"38830": "Destruction of Army Group Center (second edition)"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1081": {"name": "Jim Dunnigan"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1973", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"1030": "Redmond A.

Stacking limit is 3 units/hex. Players alternate moves. Order of phases in each movement turn is: movement phase, combat phase, second mechanized movement phase. Semi-active zones of control extend into adjacent hexes, with some exceptions. Units pay two extra movement points to enter or leave an enemy zone of control, and may move directly from one controlled hex to another if they have enough movement points. Attacking is voluntary. Combat results involve unit eliminations, exchanges, and retreats, but the Axis mechanized units have a modified step-reduction mechanism (an eliminated Axis mechanized unit is replaced by a weak battlegroup which has no zone of control, and is worth extra victory points to the Russian player if it's eliminated in a later combat).<br/><br/>Victory is determined by victory points, gained by eliminating enemy units and, for the German player, for failure by the Russian player to have a continuous line from the north to the south board edge at the end of his turn.<br/><br/>Four scenarios are provided, ranging from the historical one where Hitler's propensity for issuing &quot;Stand Fast&quot; orders finally caught up with the Axis, to the maximum withdrawal scenario, in which the Axis essentially eliminates the portion of the front historically covered by Army Group North and uses the forces of that Army Group to strengthen the resulting greatly-shortened line in the Army Group Center area.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 days<br/>Hex: 10 miles / 16 km<br/>Units: Kampfgruppe to Corps<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 28&quot; map<br/>One single-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One foldout rules folder (folds out to 10 pages)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"82913": "SPI Flat Pack edition"}, "average": "5.67451", "name": "Destruction of Army Group Center", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "102", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"11966": "Country: Russia"}}, "8756": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic51396.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1646": {"name": "Don Alexander"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "1", "age": "14", "boardgamepublisher": {"962": {"name": "Omega Games (I)"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic51396_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "Eastern Front Solitaire : Germany Campaign in Russia is a fast-paced single player wargame that reproduces the circumstances, the events, and the forces that fought the fiercest war in history.

Do not mix it up with another game by the same name from TSR/ SPI or the latter Decision Games.<br/><br/>NEPPAGames: ETO's historical simulation of the European Theater during World War II provides the framework where players are free to pursue their own strategic course of action. Each action has both short term and long term economic and military consequences. How players react to these consequences in relation to their own strategy will ultimately decide their fate.<br/><br/>Six different games (three Campaigns and three Scenarios) are available right out of the box, allowing players to select a game based upon their interests and available time. Game turns are seasonal, each representing a three month period. The map board, hard-mounted, depicts the WWII battlegrounds of Europe from France to Russia, and from Norway to North Africa to the Middle East.<br/><br/>While the interaction of all the different aspects of NEPPAGames: ETO is complex, the game is designed with simplicity and maximum playability in mind. On an Avalon Hill complexity rating, ETO's complexity would be about 7.<br/><br/>NEPPAGames: ETO&trade; uses a zone-based area movement system for ground and air units. The use of a zone or area-based mapboard significantly increases playability. Since each hex covers less ground than a zone or area, hexed base games require more playing pieces.  More playing pieces require more time to move them around, which is what the game wanted to avoid in the first place.  The mapboard measures approximately 2ft x 3ft (or 24&quot;x36&quot;).<br/><br/>Stacking limits are imposed. Terrain effects on combat are considered. Terrain and map features include mountains, swamps, beaches, fortresses,overwater crossings, ports (both beach and coastal), capital cities, special Russian defense and factory zones, oil, and more. Warfare Production Points or WPP's (Pronounced whips) are the currency of NEPPAGames: ETO. WPPs pay for everything from Declarations of War to Unit Construction.  Something that is similar in concept of Building Resources Points (BRPs) in Third Reich, The Rise and Fall of from Avalon Hill.<br/><br/>Represented in NEPPAGames: ETO are the forces of Germany, Italy, Britain, France, Russia, the United States, the Axis Minor Allies, and the armies of almost all neutral countries are depicted in the game. Each country's army is unique, with a fixed force pool of various unit types which are either available at start or available but unbuilt. Additional units may become available at historically appropriate times. Units include infantry, artillery, armor, air, naval, airborne, and U-boats. Each unit has different capabilities and differing attack and defense values. The units that will come with the game will be cardboard counters.<br/><br/>Ground combat features both normal combat and armored breakthrough and exploitation. Air units within range of a battle can lend their weight both on the attack and in defense. Air superiority is most often a requirement for success on the battlefield. Attacks can be made in the face of a heavy defense, but success is not guaranteed, and often, a heavy price must be paid.<br/><br/>Naval units are required for amphibious invasion, transport, shipping of troops and currency, shore bombardment, and strategic warfare. German U-boats can launch attacks against the steady stream of incoming convoys bound for Britain or attempt to sever the Murmansk convoy routes. As time passes, Allied ASW forces gain in both numbers and effectiveness.<br/><br/>NEPPAGames: ETO will have you engaged in a titanic clash between Allied and Axis forces on old and perhaps new battlefields of WWII. The outcome is up to you.<br/><br/>The design goal was to combine the best elements of several existing board games (including but not limited to Axis and Allies, Third Reich, Advanced Third Reich, General Patton, etc) into a very playable, very historical package. The game will have appeal to several categories of gamers:<br/><br/>1) Current Axis and Allies players looking for more historical and less ahistorical play (i.e. &quot;the stack&quot;),<br/>2) Former Avalon Hill gamers who enjoyed the historical accuracy and gameplay but wished for less complexity and more playability, and<br/>3) New gamers wanting to play a great new WWII strategy game.<br/><br/>Game components include:<br/>2ft x 3ft Beautifully Rendered Mounted Map Board<br/>20 page Game Manual<br/>8 page Campaign and Scenario Booklet that includes six different games you can play right out of the box<br/>442 Superbly Detailed Die-Cut Counters<br/>9 Counter Bags<br/>18 Force Pool Cards for use with the appropriate Campaign or Scenario<br/>1 Turn Sequence Sheet<br/>2 Dice<br/>Game Box<br/><br/>"}, "8784": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2091612.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1930", "maxplayers": "13", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": {"553": {"name": "Cadaco"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2091612_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Includes 12 boards and a large number of poker-style chips (no cards, however).

The preferred figure scale is 1:60 and the ground scale is 1&quot; = 50 meters. Play is divided into 2-hour Grand Battle Turns, with each Grand Battle Turn subdivided into six tactical turns. Players normally take the role of army and corps commanders, and receive a variable number of command points each Grand Battle Turn, the actual number being determined by the talent rating of the historical general they're representing and the roll of two 10-sided dice. Commanders issue orders to the units under them, with each order requiring a different number of command points. Once an order is issued, there's some delay before it can be executed. The minimum delay depends on distance between the commander issuing the order and the most distant unit affected by it, and there's a variable number of tactical turns of additional delay, dependent on the quality of the generals involved and the roll of two ten-sided dice, before the order actually gets carried out. The smallest units on the board are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries, but orders are issued only down to division (or elite brigade level).<br/><br/>Actions within a tactical turn are divided up into multiple phases, most of which are skipped in any particular turn because they don't apply (e.g., the infantry combat resolution phase is skipped if no infantry units are in melee this tactical turn). The designers state in the foreword that one of their objectives is that experienced players should be able to run wall-clock time and game time just about in synch--that is, a Grand Battle Turn should not take more than 2 hours to play, even at the hottest point in the battle.<br/><br/>The original rules came in a bookcase-sized box, and included a rulebook (with rating charts for units and generals, by nationality), three pages of combat charts, three sheets of thin board status markers, and a pair of different-colored 10-sided dice. An updated set of rules was supposed to be issued in 2000-2001, but appears to have fallen by the wayside. Some play test versions of the updated rules do exist.<br/><br/>These are NOT simple rules. They require a fair amount of knowledge of the Napoleonic period to play, since they reward historical formations and tactics and penalize certain forms of rule-lawyering.

Each Game-Turn is comprised of a Fire Phase, followed by a Movement Phase, during which the players alternate moving units (those that have not fired), and terminating with an Indirect Fire Phase, during which the players employ and assess fire from off-map artillery and mortar units.<br/><br/>Firefight makes extensive use of tables to express the strength of a firing unit against a particular target at a given distance.

This procedure allows us to rate different weapon systems versus different target types with much greater accuracy than heretofore. Another innovation is the integration of the terrain effects directly onto the CRT's.

He/she gets the 3 red markers and tries to find the three treasures.<br/>The other player shuffles the discs, draws three of them and looks at them, without letting the treasure hunter see them. These discs specify the locations where the treasures are. The other discs form a face-down stack.<br/>The treasure hunter then takes the first disc from the stack and places it on the corresponding location on the board. His/her opponent checks how many treasures are adjacent to that location and marks this by rotating the tile in such a way that the hole shows the same number as dots as there are treasures on adjacent spaces. This is repeated until the treasure hunters thinks he/she knows where the three treasures are. He/she marks the suspected locations with the red markers. Then the actual locations of the treasures are revealed.

Players secretly select one of their card corners and the cards are held back to back with numbers showing through the holes.  The value of each card is determined by the lowest number showing through one of its holes; the highest-valued wins.  Ties use the next lowest number, etc.  This is the 'quick play' game.<br/><br/>The more complex game involves each player selecting five different cards (the two players could each use the same card, but no player may play with duplicates).  Players select cards secretly and compare them as in the quick play game.  The losing card is withdrawn (to be replaced by a new card in the next round) and the winner scores the value difference.  Quick plays continue until one player runs out of card or concedes and the winner is determined according to accumulated score.<br/><br/>Additional rules exist for using the cards as a convention-wide game in which players attempt to accumulate cards originally belonging to as many players as possible through trading and quick play victories.

As she did so, the shadow became independent and ruled over the land, drainig life and colors from it. An old bard's song tells her that she needs to cross the country, aided by some companions (the players). So, it is a heroic prophesy fairy tale of saving a cursed land.<br/><br/>Goal: The game is semi - co - operative as the players share the goal of moving the queen from one corner of the board to the opposite corner. And all players lose if the shadow lands on the same tile as any other piece or if a player can't pay sun pearls when required by the game. However, players can give each other pearls at any time If the queen reaches the corner, all players are considered winners, but the player with the most pearls is considered the most successful.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The game is played on a modular board made up of 5 x 5 tiles which are turned upside down and upside up during play. Players take turns. During a turn, two special dice are thrown to determine the movement of pieces on the board: depending on the result, either the player moves their figure and the shadow in opposing directions or the players get a chance to move the queen one tile towards the goal. In order to move the queen, players draw a task card asking them for some kind of word (e.g. &quot;name a tool&quot;) the letters of which are restricted by the current state of the tiles on the board using an hour glass as a time limit. The task cards come in three levels of difficulty.<br/><br/>The game has a strong element of luck as an unfortunate die roll can easily cause the players to lose with no means of direct protection against it. Player decision/influence is limited to the word game and deciding the path the queen figure takes (although that is also restricted so as to forbid detours).<br/><br/>Important: While the game comes with a 4 - language rules booklet, the task cards are monolingual in German, so at least one person needs to be able to understand that language. In addition, the background story is simplified in the translations and the element of the player with the most sun pearls at the end of the game being the most successful is missing.<br/><br/>"}, "8907": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3017": {"name": "Clemens Helld\u00f6rfer"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fl\u00f6\u00dfer am Katarakt", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "13", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic103933_t.jpg", "average": "6.61538", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2017": {"name": "Werksiedlung Kandern"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic103933.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"115119": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1011": {"name": "Transportation"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Each player has five raftsmen (pieces) whom he must bring safely across the river to the opposite side of the board - the side of the opponent.

Players place their pieces face down on the fields on their side of the board. A third player is required to act as a referee to determine the outcome of fights (which occur when a piece moves into a field with an opposing piece). <br/>Fights are resolved based on the rank of different pieces.  Pieces that are ranked high such as the General or Lieutenant General defeat pieces of lesser rank such as Engineers (Gong Ping) and Sergeants.  There are two special tiles - a mine which destroys anyone who attacks it (with the exception of a Engineer), the missile which can kill any unit and in the process destroys itself.<br/><br/>Camps remain vacant at the start of the game and remain vacant until a piece occupies them.

It had its origins in the bitter conflict between Muslims and Christians, Slavs and Turks. The war proved to be a turning point in that it completely altered the balance of power in the east. In less than 40 years this helped produce the European catastrophe known as the Great War (WW I). Echoes of these ethnic and religious troubles resound today, as the peoples of Balkans and Near East still fight each other in a struggle for dominance. The Russo-Turkish War did not just cripple the Ottoman Empire. It made Russia into the dominant power in the East, and demonstrated the twin impact of modern technology and modern ideology on warfare.<br/><br/>The System rules apply to all games in the Wars of the Imperial Age series, and simulate the conditions of warfare in the late 19th century. This is a revision of the System rules presented with Franco-Prussian War (S&amp;T #149), and completely replaces the System rules book found there. Important changes from the original version are indicated by a double pound sign (##) at the beginning of the rule. Players familiarizing themselves with the game may wish to use just the System rules. The Specific Rules that apply only to the particular game and cover military and political conditions unique to the specific situation.<br/>Units represent historical leaders and headquarters staffs; corps, division-, and brigade-sized units; and fortifications. Each unit is rated for its combat strength, training class, and movement ability. (Specific Rules) Additionally, headquarters are rated for their Operations capability to enhance movement and combat capabilities, as well as conduct various politically oriented functions.<br/><br/>All units are deployed face down, and are revealed to the enemy only if he conducts reconnaissance or intelligence operations. Movement is performed by the moving force rolling on one of four March tables (Regular March, Forced March, Railroad, Naval) and applying the result. Combat is fought between enemy units in individual adjacent hexes; each player draws a Battle Results marker at random. This gives the number of enemy combat factors eliminated, effects on enemy morale, and special results for cavalry, and siege guns.The typical size of units are brigades.<br/><br/>Politics are a factor in the game. Each side has a National Will Index which gives the current level of popular support. This is affected by combat outcomes and other game events.

The regular Yahtzee rules listed below are used (except that there are thirty-nine categories instead of thirteen). The columns on the score sheet are divided into first, second and third with a multiplier added to each. For First column the scores are just added up, for second column the scores are doubled and for third column the scores are tripled so in effect throwing 4 - 6's in column one would be valued at 24 but those same 4 - 6's put in column three would be worth 72 points. Therefore it is important to put your very good scores in the third column.<br/><br/>Yahtzee rules: A classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories. Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc. Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible. When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Yahtzee<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    YourTurnMyTurn (Turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>Microbadges:  (Buy one.)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"94921": "Alga Swedish Edition 1987"}, "name": "Triple Yahtzee", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "5.71976", "usersrated": "297", "boardgameaccessory": {"138835": "Triple Yahtzee scorepad"}, "boardgamefamily": {"24924": "Yacht"}}, "8945": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic336406.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"23653": "Tournament Stadium Checkers"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"73990": {"name": "Merlin Edward Engle"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1952", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"6800": {"name": "American Toys"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic336406_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "The 1952 game Stadium Checkers was the most complex and the liveliest version of this gravity-based, logic-puzzle race game. A special concentric 'stadium' is required, along with 5 marbles or balls beginning at the start quadrants on the stadium's uppermost and outermost ring. The earliest version of the game had 7 internal stepped rings, while later versions changed the rules and subtracted rings to simplify and slow down the game.<br/><br/>A player designates a particular marble to be moved around into a particular slot, OR a particular slot to be moved over to a specific marble of their color, and as they slide the ring or marble as described, other marbles may fall down into lower slots before the slide is completed.<br/><br/>According to Winning Moves Games (2007), the objective of Stadium Checkers (formerly marketed as Roller Bowl) is to get your marbles to the center of the stadium at their matching colored quadrant hole by selecting and moving a single ring and sliding it in a selected direction until a marble falls into a vacant slot due to the force of gravity. A single marble falling into a slot terminates the movement for the turn. Marbles falling into incorrectly colored holes are re-introduced at the rim of the stadium by the player of the corresponding color as the marble.<br/><br/>This game is usually called Stadium Checkers or Intrigue. The reduction in the number of rings seriously affected the strategic complexity of the game in redesign, and reducing its overall size made it more likely that mishaps with the smaller, plastic balls might occur and cause illegal moves.<br/><br/>Variants: restricting ring selection to that in contact with one's marbles makes the game more strategically challenging, and designating the ring-mover as the re-introducer of incorrectly finishing marbles, rather than their owning player, would complicate re-entry and reward key ring movement.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"109003": "Berwick Edition"}, "average": "5.51413", "name": "Stadium Checkers", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "age": "6", "usersrated": "134", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}}, "8946": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1273407.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"59211": {"name": "Hiroaki Suzuki"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"3569": "Eiji Wakasugi"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"403": {"name": "Anv\u00e4ndbart Litet F\u00f6retag"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1273407_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"19625": "2002 Japan Boardgame Prize Best Japanese Game Nominee"}, "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>Conceal your secret code, outguess your opponent, deduce the solution, amaze your foes.

The rules are in 19 languages!<br/><br/>The board is laid out around the constructed play set (in either the standard layout or a customized one) and the equipment pieces (shovel, pistol, binoculars, spear, satchel and map) are spread randomly on the cross spaces (of which there are 14 on the board); the remaining items start in the Scorpion Palace.  The Challenge (5) and Item (8) cards are spread face up to serve as reference cards.  There are two playable characters and three &quot;bad guys&quot;.<br/><br/>To move, the die is rolled and the hero's Speed factor added in.  Items collected add to the Speed, Luck or Strength factors.  A hero can only carry what the figure can actually carry --two hands, maybe a backpack with a loop on its side.  Once the Scorpion Palace (or the Elephant) is reached, challenges are faced.  You choose which factor to use, although some items mean you win the challenge automatically (most items just give a bonus).  A die is added (re-roll Hooks); if your total is less than the Challenge rating, you lose an item and must try again later.  Once a Challenge is defeated, it is cleared for all players.<br/><br/>Outside the Palace, when you roll a Hook then the bad guy Sam Sinister challenges you.  The hero picks a skill factor and both him and Sam Sinister add a die (re-roll Hooks and ties).  A defeat again means you lose an item.  A win means you take an item from Sam Sinister!  The other two bad guys are faced the same way, except that they don't move about.<br/><br/>The Elephant (or any other means of transportation, if playing combined game sets) increases movement considerably since you now move one tile per die pip instead of one square (the tiles measure 5 squares across).<br/><br/>The game ends when a hero reaches the final square with the Golden Shield.

His great great grandfather Batist Rev. Henry Merrill Henderson led his family there in 1852 and lived near Grant Road/El Camino, called Fremont Mayfield, now Mountain View. Terry attended Monte Loma- Mt. View, Benton-Sunnyvale, Pomeroy/LC Curtis- Santa Clara, and graduated Buchser HS '71 in Santa Clara. His mother Luella (Palo Alto HS '48) worked at Farnsworth, Ampex, Dalmo Victor, Fairchild, HP, Memorex, Philco and others. The game was devoloped with his cousin, Gary Suda, from April of 1980 intended for 9/80 delivery it way delayed till 11/26/80. Many elements of the game are from personal interactions he and the family had living in 'Silicon Vally'. Including knowing most of the companies from birth. His Uncle Herman Williams was a police sargent at Stanford University, his Uncle John Suda owned Stanford Plumbing &amp; Heating, his Uncle Elmer Silva ran his own Magazine/Candy Concession at HP corp on Page Mill and raced a horse at Bay Meadows he used a barn on the corner of Page Mill/El Camino. His Uncle Ernie Larsen was the great grandson of Espinosa &amp; Secundino Robles, the Pena Rancho owner of 3/4 of all Palo Alto. They lived in 2 houses @415 Cambridge and played on California while the grandparents owned Barron Park Cab. A lustrious group of family that did not have much education nor money, nor property by 1950s.<br/><br/>Terry had been a Navy Photographer and was attending De Anza/Foothill at the time. He being a year older at Monte Vista than Steve Jobs, would only meet the 2 Steves later in 1977 at Cupertino's Focus Camera shop he managed and did some early photography for Apple and handled some routine finishing. In'78 he became the Photographer for San Jose Magazine (Gill Cable) and became more intune with the phenomena that was occuring in the county. In 79-80 he worked as a minor salesman for Bantam Books, and made many bookstore/distributor/publicity rounds. A low paying job, it allowed him to meet many famous authors of the day, gain confidence and inspiration. It was really a local SF Radio show's detective contest about a detective travelling everywhere in the bay area, that inspired a Silicon Valley based game from what had already started as a book about Silicon Valley Gurus, the leaders who were not yet the celebs they are now. Access was still rather simple. In 1984-85 he worked as a salesman and developer for Nolan Bushnell's Axlon; selling assorted Trivia card games, AG Bears, Compu Bots, &amp; Petsters. Here he met Stanford student Bob Moog, who was freelancing, Bob was very ambitious and like Steve Jobs sought greener pasture, as no one could gain security with Nolan. Bob bought a Murder Mystery game from a lady back east that had a following at the time, and with that later started University Games. Terry was responsible for promoting and introducing him to John N Hansen, a friend he had known since '81, John was like an uncle, and was a very succesful game publisher and distributor. Through John Hansen, Bob was able to get much needed distribution. Later he &amp; John's relationship grew.

The kit costs $10 (which includes postage and packing) - black and white photocopy of board and color counters to be pasted up - and it is obtainable from Paul at 441 Niagara Road, Oconomowoc, WI 53066.

The track is circular, with four lanes, with some interaction and crossing over between lanes. Each player (2-4) has four pawns numbered 1-4. This number indicates the distance the pawn may move per turn, and where it may be entered onto the board (the fastest pawn (4) must travel the full distance, but each successively slower pawn travels one fourth less distance than its predecessor, so that the (1) pawn travels only one quarter of the board). Pawns may not jump others nor may two pawns occupy the same space. Ending a turn on a space occupied by an opponent's pawn causes the opponent's pawn to be returned to its starting position.  Pawns of any ownership that lie on spaces connected by a shaded background add their values together for determining movement. So a (red 1), (blue 4), (green 3) that all lie within the same shaded area would  give the first pawn to move, 8 spaces.  A player must use all movement without retracing his path on that turn.  If the player can not use the entire movement then the pawn can not be moved.  If none of his pawns may be moved the entire amount then the player forfeits that turn.

It requires two players, with one player controlling the German and German-allied (Rumanian, Finnish, etc.) forces and the other controlling the various Soviet forces: regular troops, militia divisions,and Guards formations. The size of the game makes it well suited to team play: each side can easily be played by a team of two or three players.<br/><br/>Fire in the East's 6 multi-color maps stretch from Warsaw to Stalingrad, from Murmansk to Sevastopol. Terrain is analyzed in detail, with over 20 different types, including two types of rivers, forests, and mountains and four types of cities.<br/>There are over 2500 counters each marked with its historical designation - the most accurate and detailed order of battle ever published for the Eastern Front. The counters represent divisions, and independent brigades, regiments, and battalions. Units are highly differentiated by type, from armor, infantry, and artillery to Soviet Guards, NKVD, and katyushas, German flammpanzers and railroad artillery, and Finnish ski troops. Air units vary from outmoded I-15 biplane fighters to the Me-109F, from Ju 87 Stukas and Il-2 Sturmoviks to Pe-8 long-range bombers. The capital ships of the Soviet Baltic and Black Sea fleets are also represented.<br/><br/>The rules include extensive armor and antitank effects, plus special capabilities for many other unit types, from assault engineers to paratroopers. Every combat arm has its own abilities and limitations, and the players must use them all to achieve victory. The air system is very detailed - almost a game in itself. Logistics rules cover the different gauges of German and Soviet rails and allow supply lines to be extended temporarily by trucks. Isolated units gradually lose their combat abiliites and then collapse, but those besieged in cities and fortresses survive longer. Other important rules cover weather effects, the unique nature of the Arctic front, the need for artillery support, the German surprise attack, doctrinal limits of Soviet mechanized units, and more.<br/><br/>Fire in the East is extremely challenging to both sides. German panzer spearheads can break through the front almost at will, but soon will find themselves outrunning their supply lines, infantry, and air support. Careful play and the optimum use of all arms are needed to travel the long road to Moscow. The Soviets are faced with the need to preserve their army for the final defense of major cities while delaying the German advance to make that defense possible by determined resistance and carefully chosen local counterattacks.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    six 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps<br/>    over 2500 die-cut counters<br/>    a complete set of rules<br/>    a complete set of charts<br/>    two dice<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"44772": "GDW edition"}, "average": "7.44269", "name": "Fire in the East", "playingtime": "3000", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "253", "boardgameaccessory": {"105552": "Europa By Mail, Europa play aids kit 6"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"104": "Europa Series"}}, "8994": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Zingers", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": {"2017": "Voting"}, "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "14", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic53604_t.jpg", "average": "4.85714", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1226": {"name": "Play All Day Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic53604.jpg", "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1030": {"name": "Party Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "In Zingers, a player picks the best Zinger for a famous personality in a wacko situation.

Players divide into two teams, racing their tokens on parallel tracks to the finish line.  A card is secretly drawn and a &quot;clue giver&quot; tries to get his team to say the word on it...without using any of three related words that are also on the card. The team has a timer during which they score as many clues as possible.  The number correct is the number of squares the token is moved.<br/><br/>One difference from the original game is that the &quot;buzzer&quot; is actually a plastic squeak toy instead of the harsh electric buzzer.
