In Dark Deeds players take the role of minions in service to a powerful, mysterious, and clearly villainous, patron. The Patron wants deeds of infamy, violence and coercion committed and you are the ones who must avoid the authorities, the do-gooders and, most of all, each other to perform them. Rich rewards beckon, along with horrific punishments for failure. So are you the kind of malevolent minion the patron needs?<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s a &lsquo;street&rsquo; deck for the minion&rsquo;s prospective targets &ndash; clerics, artisans, and merchants and their protective guards from the city watch. Then there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;tavern&rsquo; deck with potentially useful loot and plot cards to help the minions get the job done. The implacable hand of evil is revealed by the nemesis cards in the street deck &ndash; princes, politicians, and do-gooders the player&rsquo;s evil patron wants eliminated. The tavern deck includes &lsquo;Dark Deeds&rsquo;, specific missions to take out particular nemeses (that&rsquo;s the plural of nemesis in case you&rsquo;re wondering). Picking up a Dark Deed is a very mixed blessing. A rich reward is earned for completing it, but it can&rsquo;t be discarded and the patron will exact a heavy price for any incomplete Dark Deeds held at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The masterful touch is how the street deck is laid out to create a constantly moving scene of different characters. Each turn the street moves along, the card closest to the end leaves and everyone else shuffles up with empty spaces filled from the deck. Minions enter from one end of the street and have to get past any intervening guards to reach their targets.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Dark Deeds", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["203121", "217383"], "usersrated": "80", "average": "7.9175", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Polyhedron Collider Cast Episode 4", "The Polyhedron Collider Cast Episode 6"]}, "198004": {"boardgamedesigner": ["\u5927\u6751 \u76f4\u77e2 (Omura Naoya)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Kiyoshikenga\u629c Kenai", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Simultaneous Action Selection"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2976046_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["\u5927\u6751 \u76f4\u77e2 (Omura Naoya)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Three dots games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2976046.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "\u8056\u5263\u30ac\u629c\u30b1\u30ca\u30a4 (a.k.a.

It was a routine mission until those fools on the GSCV Narwhal miscalculated their hyperjump and disappeared into the event horizon!<br/><br/>Your ship&rsquo;s alarms scream danger: your instruments register a sudden and violent increase in the black hole&rsquo;s diameter. The black hole is relentlessly growing larger, and you are dangerously close!<br/><br/>You know you must leave before being gobbled up by the black hole, but your hyperjump drive is useless now that the event horizon is so close, and the gravity waves make your sub-light drive slow and unreliable. If you are to survive, you must escape using every means available to you. Think!<br/><br/>An idea springs to mind: Could you use your ship&rsquo;s powerful tractor beams to help pull yourself to safety? But what could you target with enough mass and momentum to make a difference?<br/><br/>As the inescapable answer washes over you, you set your jaw in resignation at what you must do. For years you&rsquo;ve worked closely with the crews on the other ships, and some of them are even close friends. But now, you order your crew to warm up the tractor beam emitters and target the ship ahead&hellip; It&rsquo;s everyone for themselves at the edge of forever.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>In Charybdis, you captain a ship and crew trying to escape from the orbit of a black hole that is relentlessly expanding. Your engines are affected by the singularity, so there is only one way to guarantee survival: by targeting other ships with your tractor beam to pull yourself to safety, while dragging them closer to their ultimate doom.<br/><br/>On each turn, you roll your Crew Dice, choosing which to keep and which to re-roll. Your goal is to create combos that allow you to assign your Crew to the various tasks aboard your Ship: manning the Helm (movement), maintaining the Fusion Generators (energy), or upgrading your Navigational Computer, Tractor Beam, or Shields.<br/><br/>You can use your Tractor Beam to steal dice from your opponents, which you roll on your turn in addition to your Crew Dice. These extra dice give you a boost while slowing down your unfortunate targets. You can even lock a Tractor Beam on nearby Asteroids, but watch out--Asteroids can trap you with their gravity and drag you closer to your doom.<br/><br/>After each player has a turn, Asteroids trapped in the Black Hole's gravity fall inward, and then the Event Horizon expands, potentially devouring your Ship and Crew.<br/><br/>Charybdis took 1st place for Best Artwork &amp; Graphic Design, 1st place for Best Written Rules, and 2nd place for Best Overall Design in the 2016 One-Page PNP Contest (see contest results).<br/><br/>"}, "198035": {"poll": [], "name": "Dumstrut", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Voting"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "9", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3042965_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kylsk\u00e5pspoesi AB"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3042965.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Swedish first edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia"], "age": "16", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Dumstrut is a quiz game.

Better keep a good watch on your gold with a Guard or someone may try to steal it with a Thief.<br/><br/>Lower the prices at the Market so you can buy more items or close the Market so your opponents cannot buy items to hurt you with.<br/><br/>Once you have several ships at your command, use the Armada Card to join them all together and fight as one to destroy your enemies.<br/><br/>Force your opponents to Walk The Plank or strand them on an island so they lose a turn.<br/><br/>The play is simple. Draw 1 card, play 1 card (some cards can alter this). Play a ship, increase your ship, decrease another players ship, open/ close a market, steal cards or if you draw an attack card then attack a player with your ship. Receive gold and buy items to make you stronger or hurt your opponents.<br/><br/>Each expansion pack adds more things you can do and more markets to buy from to help you on your quest to rule the seas.<br/><br/>The main game includes 350 cards. There are 6 expansion packs ranging from 50 to 100 cards each. Each expansion pack adds a new level of play to the game.<br/><br/>The first expansion pack of 50 cards &quot;Pirate Attack- The Magic Shop&quot; adds a Magic Shop full of things to help your ships and hurt your enemies.  Double your ships cannons or strength, reincarnate ships, confuse where a ship attacks, and some main deck cards like Royal Navy to attack all ships and Hurricanes.<br/><br/>The second expansion pack of 50 cards &quot;Pirate Attack- Raise The Dead&quot; adds bigger ships, cards to steal Magic Shop cards, more Sea Creatures, larger Royal Navy, Raise the Dead cards, Duplicate a ship, Spirit of Good Fortune, Eliminate Cards and Sails of Invisibility.<br/><br/>The third expansion pack of 50 cards &quot;Pirate Attack- Miss-Direction&quot; adds more Ships, more Sea Creatures, Whirlpools, Windstorms, Stranded On An Island, Exploding Cannons, and Miss Direction.<br/><br/>The forth expansion pack of 100 cards and 2 Dice &quot;Pirate Attack- Walk The Plank&quot; adds another Ship, Walk The Plank, The Trap, Smoke Screen, Power Play, The Magician, Damn Pirates, Insurance, Ship Bonus, Card Bonus, Into The Sea, Davy Jones Locker, End Of The World, Force Fields, Visions, Return To Port and The Gambler.  So many more ways to mess with other players.<br/><br/>The fifth expansion pack of 100 cards and 1 Chip &quot;Pirate Attack- The Tavern&quot; adds a whole new market. The Tavern is a place where you can bribe a drunk sailor into telling you secrets and info, some good, some bad.  Get Double Play, Sneak Thief, Pick Pockets, add cannons and strength to all of your ships, give away your hand, make someone lose their gold, mix all cards and re-deal, give all ships a Witch Doctor, hurt another player with minus cannons and strength to all their ships.<br/><br/>The sixth expansion pack of 50 cards and 2 dice &quot;Pirate Attack- Special Abilities&quot; gives players (who chose to) a Special Ability, but only if they are willing to Sell Their Soul to get it.  Get a bad item like no ships bigger than 7/7, overcharged at markets, no gold when killing a ship.  But then get a good item like Black Market, The Vault, or Money Master.  This deck also includes The Blockade so you can stop cards from being played and 20 new ships with abilities.<br/>The main game can be played as a stand alone and expansion packs can be added to give the players more things to do during the game. Best when played with 3 to 10 players. Ages 8 and up.<br/>This is a high quality game. It comes in a nice, sturdy 9&quot; x 12&quot; x 3&quot; game box with plastic insert to hold all the cards from the main game and each expansion pack, so all the cards are together. Expansion pack boxes can be folded and placed under the plastic insert for keeping.<br/><br/>The game has great replay ability. Not the same old game every time. Certain cards make things different every game. You can even remove cards to give the game a different play. Play with or without expansion packs.  You can play to a certain number of Fame Points, play for a specified amount of time and most Fame Points at that time wins or play all the cards and go for last ship standing wins.<br/><br/>"}, "198078": {"rpgdesigner": ["Johnn Four", "John Lewis (I)", "Tony Medeiros"], "statistics": [], "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 662)", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984278.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Roleplaying Tips"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["RoleplayingTips.com"], "rpgissueversion": ["HTML Version", "Text Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984278_t.jpg", "description": "Combat Parley<br/><br/>"}, "198079": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Reader Contribution)", "Johnn Four", "Phil Nicholls"], "statistics": [], "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 661)", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984285.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Roleplaying Tips"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["RoleplayingTips.com"], "rpgissueversion": ["HTML Version", "Text Version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984285_t.jpg", "description": "Five hazardous elemental dungeons<br/><br/>"}, "198080": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jesse C.

And the battles fought for this prize are a record of the changing face of how war was fought.<br/><br/>At the start of the 'war', the main forces were mounted men-at-arms and a tightly packed and closed formation of pike, especially as represented by the Swiss. But as battle churned into battle, that slowly changed. Firepower, in the form of the arquebus (an early musket) became increasingly prevalent and dominant, forcing the closed pike formations to open up, as the Spanish did (with sword and buckler), and the reliance on heavily mounted cavalry to decrease.<br/><br/>Arquebus shows all of this in true die-rolling glory, featuring 8 major battles: Fornovo, Cerignola, Agnadello, Ravenna, Marignano, Bicocca, Pavia, and Ceresole. These are all really great game-players, with all but two of them half-mappers playable in 3 hours or less. The other two are the 'tiny' page-sized (8&quot; x 11&quot;) Cerignola and the big one-mapper, the major, final battle of Pavia. Pavia was a crushing defeat wherein France lost over 50% of its army and almost all of its nobility of command, including her king, Francis I, who was captured. But for gamers, Pavia is wonderful gameplay, with units all over the greatly detailed map, much maneuver and many tough decisions to make.<br/><br/>Arquebus uses the popular &quot;Men of Iron&quot; mechanics with much concentration on detail of weaponry, from the differences between closed formation and open, to the decline of the Swiss (pas d'argent? pas de Suisse), and the rise of the German Landsknecht, the major force in warfare of the era and, ironically, the best-dressed men in Europe. Yes, Landsknecht uniforms literally set the fashion trend at the time for the entire western world.<br/><br/>"}, "198088": {"poll": [], "name": "Club Life", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows/Mac/Linux Downloadable edition"], "average": "7", "videogametheme": ["Romance / Relationships"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Dharker Studio"], "videogamegenre": ["Visual Novel"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Dharker Studio"], "description": "A reclusive student is forced into joining several clubs, can he make it through the year and will he gain any new friends along the way or even find love.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "198089": {"poll": [], "name": "Wand Wars", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Occult"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Moonradish Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Action"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Moonradish Inc."], "description": "Witches, wizards, demons and magical beasts compete for power and glory.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "198090": {"poll": [], "name": "Discovering Colors - Animals", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Animals", "Art"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Frogames"], "videogamegenre": ["Other"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Frogames"], "description": "Discovering Colors is a coloring game featuring fun animals!

Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.<br/><br/>Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.<br/><br/>"}, "198121": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Villainous Archetypes Volume VII", "rpgdesigner": ["Alex Riggs", "Joshua Zaback"], "rpgproducer": ["Rosa Gibbons"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2978375.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Necromancers of the Northwest"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Villainous Archetypes", "Weekly Wonders"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2978375_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s Good to Be Bad!<br/><br/>Sick of saving the world? Tired of being expected to leap at the chance to solve everyone&rsquo;s petty problems? Have a thing for twirling mustaches and overly-elaborate deathtraps? Why not mix things up with a villainous character! At some point in their gaming career, everyone has considered playing an &ldquo;evil campaign,&rdquo; but with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game being devoted to goody-two-shoes heroes, it can sometimes be hard to find support. Want some evil options for your character? You&rsquo;ve found them!<br/><br/>This book presents five new villainous archetypes for five different classes. Included are the cruel taskmaster, a hunter archetype that specializes in bringing out the worst and most feral aspects of her animal companion, the dark meditant, a monk archetype focused on unlocking new ways to inflict pain upon his foes, the curse oracle, an oracle archetype that inflicts horrible curses upon others, the ghost baiter, a spiritualist archetype that provokes and manipulates spirits rather than calms them, and can even feed stray spirits to its soul-devouring phantom, and the dark crusader, a warpriest archetype that focuses on killing foes in the name of evil ends, and is rewarded for each life he takes.<br/><br/>Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as Way of the Wicked, by Fire Mountain Games, or the first official Paizo adventure path made specifically for evil characters), or you just want an excuse to play an unrepentant, irredeemable villain, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for villainous NPCs as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.<br/><br/>"}, "198122": {"rpgdesigner": ["Fabio \"Kroovian\" Bottoni", "Emilio Fabbri"], "rpgitemversion": ["Saddle stapled Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Nell'Occhi del Ciclone", "rpgartist": ["Francesca Marina Costa"], "rpgproducer": ["Francesca Marina Costa"], "rpg": ["Walkthrough"], "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Corporations"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mini G4M3S Studio"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "average": "0", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/>Nell'Occhio del Ciclone &egrave; un&rsquo;avventura inedita per il Gioco di Ruolo Walkthrough, suddivisa in due parti: la prima, con una trama classica scandita da un incalzante susseguirsi di eventi; la seconda, dove in un ambiente completamente esplorabile i Personaggi avranno un unico obiettivo: salvarsi la pelle!<br/><br/>English translation:<br/>Nell'Occhio del Ciclone is an adventure for the Walkthrough Roleplay, divided into two parts: the first, with a classic plot marked by a relentless succession of events; the second, where in a fully explorable environment the Characters will have one goal: to save his own lives!<br/><br/>"}, "198123": {"poll": [], "name": "Cosmophony", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows/Macintosh/Linux Downloadable Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2977738.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Abstract"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Bento Studio"], "videogamegenre": ["Endless Runner", "Rhythm", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Frogames"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2977738_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Moving down a tube, you shoot some obstacles and steer around others.

Heroic deeds are a must if one is to prove themselves worthy for the gratification of Olympus and the pursuit of seeing their patron deity rise to rulership! Are you strong, brave, and smart enough for the challenge? We will see how you fair against the great beasts of Hellas and the heroes and heroines who support your rival deity. This is the Heavenly Contest.

Heroes and heroines join in the Heavenly Contest to prove their worth to the deities and spread the word of their patron deity to the mortals of Hellas, in hopes of raising their patron deity to the Olympus throne. Heroes and heroines come from all walks of life, representing their patron deity as adventurers, fighters, hoplites, Olympic athletes, courtesans, sages, and rogues.

Most of the squares have a large K or M on them in five different colours. There are also special Horseshoe (Opportunity), Lightning Bolt (Crisis), Light Bulb (Bright Idea) and Superdilemma squares.<br/><br/>When they land on K or M square, they must choose a card of the colour they landed on from a box divided into 18 groups. These cards describe moral dilemmas (brief case studies) on one side, with four multiple-choice options and the real solutions for both the K and M philosophies on the other.<br/><br/>These cards are divided into three major categories based on age (Youth, Adult and Senior), each of which is divided into six colour-coded sub-categories based on the type of dilemma one must solve (Business/Professional, Biomedical, Social/Political, Environmental, Personal/Sexual, Superdilemmas).<br/><br/>The K squares ask players to answer a dilemma according to the duty-based ethics of Immanuel Kant. The M squares ask you to solve the same dilemma according to the utilitarian ethics of John Stuart Mill. The game comes with summary cards for Kant and Mill listing their seven key ideas in each case.<br/><br/>Players can use either the easy multiple-choice option, or answer the dilemma in their own words, with the other players voting on how close they came to matching the true solution. In the case of a Superdilemma, no solutions are given, so players propose their own, with others voting to determine whether it&rsquo;s correct. They can also time the game, giving each player 3-5 minutes to answer a dilemma.<br/><br/>If you get the right answer, they can move forward next turn. If they get it wrong, they move backwards when they roll again. The winner is the first player who gets to the end of the spiral track.<br/><br/>"}, "198315": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bernie McCormick"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Golden Bones of Lightwatch Tower", "rpgartist": ["Bernie McCormick", "Jeff Preston", "Thomas Tamblyn"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2981468.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Glamour Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["D&D Next Adventure Contest"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2981468_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Orlin Swift was a bard of no small reputation, who traveled the Azurewood seeking quests and adventures.

At each round, players rolls six 6 sided dice and try to score one of many combinations showed in his character sheet (pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind, etc), but watch out! If you fail on your gamble attempt you can hurt yourself instead of the enemy!

They are planetary champions, conquerors, heroes and messiahs, and they owe their vast gifts to the infusion of a few molecules of ancient, divine DNA.<br/><br/>All Lifechained creatures share a connection, however tenuous, to Phallus Space and its gods. Some Lifechained creatures are the direct descendants of one of the Third Pantheon&rsquo;s dieties, and even if they do not know it, can trace their heritage back aeons to the dawn of the Multiverse.<br/><br/>Others are hereditary royalty, a genetically superior planetary champion whose bloodline has been preserved through gene-treatments and selective incest, in the hopes of breeding a superior creature. Other Lifechains are the products of experimentation and reverse engineering- artificially grafting Lifechained DNA to a humanoid genome, or are products of strange magic that awakens the Lifechained DNA lurking in otherwise ordinary creatures. The most feared and spectacular Lifechains are the monstrous Nemesis Lifesapwn, super-predators which hunt the cosmos in search of Lifechained prey.<br/><br/>Players might choose to enter the Lifechain by selecting a species with an innate Lifechained heritage (including several of the player species found in [Species of the Otherverse] or Culture of Choice). Even if a character comes from a species not normally known for its connection to the Lifechain, that character can choose the Awakened Heritage feat to unlock their divine heritage. Once a Lifechained heritage is unlocked, a character can choose additional Lifechained feats, offering new capabilities, anytime a new feat slot opens up.<br/><br/>Lifechain feats grant amazing powers. Lifechained creatures can shapeshift into virtually any form, heal wounds that would kill entire platoons of mortals, manipulate energy, unleash primal sorcery, alter molecular structure and reality, and some wield even stranger abilities! However, power comes with a price. A Lifechained creature is easily detected by another Lifechain, and some Lifechained abilities allow a Lifechained hunter to more easily kill his demi-god brothers and sisters.<br/><br/>Powers of the Lifechain is a companion to Horrors of the Lifechain, foucsing on player abilities, where the earlier sourcebook was a collection of setting-specific monsters.<br/><br/>"}, "198462": {"rpgartist": ["Anthony Cournoyer", "John Picot", "Amanda Webb"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Culture of Choice", "rpgdesigner": ["Christopher A.

Students, one single and one team of two, would compete to answer questions to fill in hexagons on a grid. Each hexagon was filled with a letter, and the answer to the question started with that letter. If a team answered a question correctly it would turn their colour (white or blue) and they could then choose the next location on the grid, leading to the famous catchphrase &quot;Can I have a 'P' please, Bob?&quot; (having a Pee is British slang for urinating).<br/><br/>The aim of the game is for the single student (playing white) to connect from top to bottom, a minimum of four spaces, and for the pair of students to connect from left to right, a minimum of five spaces.<br/><br/>Winning would allow the team to progress to the Gold Run, where a single student (the pair would alternate if they won multiple times) would attempt to cross a more complicated version of the board.<br/><br/>The first game in the series was a two player game that played the main game only.
