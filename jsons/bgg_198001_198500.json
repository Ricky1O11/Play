In Dark Deeds players take the role of minions in service to a powerful, mysterious, and clearly villainous, patron. The Patron wants deeds of infamy, violence and coercion committed and you are the ones who must avoid the authorities, the do-gooders and, most of all, each other to perform them. Rich rewards beckon, along with horrific punishments for failure. So are you the kind of malevolent minion the patron needs?<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s a &lsquo;street&rsquo; deck for the minion&rsquo;s prospective targets &ndash; clerics, artisans, and merchants and their protective guards from the city watch. Then there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;tavern&rsquo; deck with potentially useful loot and plot cards to help the minions get the job done. The implacable hand of evil is revealed by the nemesis cards in the street deck &ndash; princes, politicians, and do-gooders the player&rsquo;s evil patron wants eliminated. The tavern deck includes &lsquo;Dark Deeds&rsquo;, specific missions to take out particular nemeses (that&rsquo;s the plural of nemesis in case you&rsquo;re wondering). Picking up a Dark Deed is a very mixed blessing. A rich reward is earned for completing it, but it can&rsquo;t be discarded and the patron will exact a heavy price for any incomplete Dark Deeds held at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The masterful touch is how the street deck is laid out to create a constantly moving scene of different characters. Each turn the street moves along, the card closest to the end leaves and everyone else shuffles up with empty spaces filled from the deck. Minions enter from one end of the street and have to get past any intervening guards to reach their targets.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"308029": "First edition"}, "name": "Dark Deeds", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "87", "average": "7.78621"}, "198004": {"boardgamedesigner": {"90682": {"name": "\u5927\u6751 \u76f4\u77e2 (Omura Naoya)"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Kiyoshikenga\u629c Kenai", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2020": "Simultaneous Action Selection"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2976046_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"90682": "\u5927\u6751 \u76f4\u77e2 (Omura Naoya)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"32533": {"name": "Three dots games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2976046.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"308030": "Japanese first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "\u8056\u5263\u30ac\u629c\u30b1\u30ca\u30a4 (a.k.a.

It was a routine mission until those fools on the GSCV Narwhal miscalculated their hyperjump and disappeared into the event horizon!<br/><br/>Your ship&rsquo;s alarms scream danger: your instruments register a sudden and violent increase in the black hole&rsquo;s diameter. The black hole is relentlessly growing larger, and you are dangerously close!<br/><br/>You know you must leave before being gobbled up by the black hole, but your hyperjump drive is useless now that the event horizon is so close, and the gravity waves make your sub-light drive slow and unreliable. If you are to survive, you must escape using every means available to you. Think!<br/><br/>An idea springs to mind: Could you use your ship&rsquo;s powerful tractor beams to help pull yourself to safety? But what could you target with enough mass and momentum to make a difference?<br/><br/>As the inescapable answer washes over you, you set your jaw in resignation at what you must do. For years you&rsquo;ve worked closely with the crews on the other ships, and some of them are even close friends. But now, you order your crew to warm up the tractor beam emitters and target the ship ahead&hellip; It&rsquo;s everyone for themselves at the edge of forever.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>In Charybdis, you captain a ship and crew trying to escape from the orbit of a black hole that is relentlessly expanding. Your engines are affected by the singularity, so there is only one way to guarantee survival: by targeting other ships with your tractor beam to pull yourself to safety, while dragging them closer to their ultimate doom.<br/><br/>On each turn, you roll your Crew Dice, choosing which to keep and which to re-roll. Your goal is to create combos that allow you to assign your Crew to the various tasks aboard your Ship: manning the Helm (movement), maintaining the Fusion Generators (energy), or upgrading your Navigational Computer, Tractor Beam, or Shields.<br/><br/>You can use your Tractor Beam to steal dice from your opponents, which you roll on your turn in addition to your Crew Dice. These extra dice give you a boost while slowing down your unfortunate targets. You can even lock a Tractor Beam on nearby Asteroids, but watch out--Asteroids can trap you with their gravity and drag you closer to your doom.<br/><br/>After each player has a turn, Asteroids trapped in the Black Hole's gravity fall inward, and then the Event Horizon expands, potentially devouring your Ship and Crew.<br/><br/>Charybdis took 1st place for Best Artwork &amp; Graphic Design, 1st place for Best Written Rules, and 2nd place for Best Overall Design in the 2016 One-Page PNP Contest (see contest results).<br/><br/>"}, "198035": {"poll": {}, "name": "Dumstrut", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2017": "Voting"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "9", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3042965_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"23331": {"name": "Kylsk\u00e5pspoesi AB"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3042965.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"308069": "Swedish first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1027": {"name": "Trivia"}}, "age": "16", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Dumstrut is a quiz game.

Meanwhile other players are trying to do the same thing to you.<br/><br/>After sending your ship to sea, you can play Blacksmith cards to increase your cannons or decrease another players cannons, Carpenter cards to increase your strength or decrease another players strength. Draw an Attack Card and then destroy an opponent's ship (if you can). When a ship is sunk, receive gold which can be spent at The Market on Witch Doctor Cards so you can curse your opponent's ships. Buy some Fortune Teller Cards to protect yourself from others placing Witch Doctor Cards on your ships.<br/><br/>Summon a Sea Creature to attack other player's ships. Force two other players to attack each other. Anything you can do to destroy your enemies and become the ruler of the seas.<br/><br/>Use a Spy to remove useful cards from other players or a Thieving Monkey to take a card from an opponent and keep it. Better keep a good watch on your gold with a Guard or someone may try to steal it with a Thief.<br/><br/>Lower the prices at the Market so you can buy more items or close the Market so your opponents cannot buy items to hurt you with.<br/><br/>Once you have several ships at your command, use the Armada Card to join them all together and fight as one to destroy your enemies.<br/><br/>Force your opponents to Walk The Plank or strand them on an island so they lose a turn.<br/><br/>The play is simple. Draw 1 card, play 1 card (some cards can alter this). Play a ship, increase your ship, decrease another players ship, open/ close a market, steal cards or if you draw an attack card then attack a player with your ship. Receive gold and buy items to make you stronger or hurt your opponents.<br/><br/>Each expansion pack adds more things you can do and more markets to buy from to help you on your quest to rule the seas.<br/><br/>The main game includes 350 cards. There are 6 expansion packs ranging from 50 to 100 cards each. Each expansion pack adds a new level of play to the game.<br/><br/>The first expansion pack of 50 cards &quot;Pirate Attack- The Magic Shop&quot; adds a Magic Shop full of things to help your ships and hurt your enemies.  Double your ships cannons or strength, reincarnate ships, confuse where a ship attacks, and some main deck cards like Royal Navy to attack all ships and Hurricanes.<br/><br/>The second expansion pack of 50 cards &quot;Pirate Attack- Raise The Dead&quot; adds bigger ships, cards to steal Magic Shop cards, more Sea Creatures, larger Royal Navy, Raise the Dead cards, Duplicate a ship, Spirit of Good Fortune, Eliminate Cards and Sails of Invisibility.<br/><br/>The third expansion pack of 50 cards &quot;Pirate Attack- Miss-Direction&quot; adds more Ships, more Sea Creatures, Whirlpools, Windstorms, Stranded On An Island, Exploding Cannons, and Miss Direction.<br/><br/>The forth expansion pack of 100 cards and 2 Dice &quot;Pirate Attack- Walk The Plank&quot; adds another Ship, Walk The Plank, The Trap, Smoke Screen, Power Play, The Magician, Damn Pirates, Insurance, Ship Bonus, Card Bonus, Into The Sea, Davy Jones Locker, End Of The World, Force Fields, Visions, Return To Port and The Gambler.  So many more ways to mess with other players.<br/><br/>The fifth expansion pack of 100 cards and 1 Chip &quot;Pirate Attack- The Tavern&quot; adds a whole new market. The Tavern is a place where you can bribe a drunk sailor into telling you secrets and info, some good, some bad.  Get Double Play, Sneak Thief, Pick Pockets, add cannons and strength to all of your ships, give away your hand, make someone lose their gold, mix all cards and re-deal, give all ships a Witch Doctor, hurt another player with minus cannons and strength to all their ships.<br/><br/>The sixth expansion pack of 50 cards and 2 dice &quot;Pirate Attack- Special Abilities&quot; gives players (who chose to) a Special Ability, but only if they are willing to Sell Their Soul to get it.  Get a bad item like no ships bigger than 7/7, overcharged at markets, no gold when killing a ship.  But then get a good item like Black Market, The Vault, or Money Master.  This deck also includes The Blockade so you can stop cards from being played and 20 new ships with abilities.<br/>The main game can be played as a stand alone and expansion packs can be added to give the players more things to do during the game. Best when played with 3 to 10 players. Ages 8 and up.<br/>This is a high quality game. It comes in a nice, sturdy 9&quot; x 12&quot; x 3&quot; game box with plastic insert to hold all the cards from the main game and each expansion pack, so all the cards are together. Expansion pack boxes can be folded and placed under the plastic insert for keeping.<br/><br/>The game has great replay ability. Not the same old game every time. Certain cards make things different every game. You can even remove cards to give the game a different play. Play with or without expansion packs.  You can play to a certain number of Fame Points, play for a specified amount of time and most Fame Points at that time wins or play all the cards and go for last ship standing wins.<br/><br/>"}, "198078": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 662)", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984278.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"17034": "Roleplaying Tips"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"308119": "HTML Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984278_t.jpg", "description": "Combat Parley<br/><br/>"}, "198079": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 661)", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984285.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"17034": "Roleplaying Tips"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"308120": "HTML Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984285_t.jpg", "description": "Five hazardous elemental dungeons<br/><br/>"}, "198080": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 660)", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2985573.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"17034": "Roleplaying Tips"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"308121": "HTML Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2985573_t.jpg", "description": "The Adventure Checklist - Part II<br/><br/>"}, "198081": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 659)", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984288.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"17034": "Roleplaying Tips"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"308122": "HTML Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984288_t.jpg", "description": "The Adventure Checklist - Part I<br/><br/>"}, "198082": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 658)", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984290.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"17034": "Roleplaying Tips"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"308123": "HTML Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984290_t.jpg", "description": "When players don't show up, what do you do?<br/><br/>"}, "198083": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 657)", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984292.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"17034": "Roleplaying Tips"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"308124": "HTML Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984292_t.jpg", "description": "How to create great non-combat encounters<br/><br/>"}, "198084": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 656)", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984294.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"17034": "Roleplaying Tips"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"308125": "HTML Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984294_t.jpg", "description": "Quest Cards<br/><br/>"}, "198085": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 655)", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984302.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"17034": "Roleplaying Tips"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"308126": "HTML Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2984302_t.jpg", "description": "How to get your players to roleplay more - the flashback method<br/><br/>"}, "198086": {"boardgamedesigner": {"87954": {"name": "Danny Zondervan"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Rushi", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2676": "Grid Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3518030_t.jpg", "average": "7.125", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"31341": {"name": "Nexci, LLC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3518030.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"308138": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Rushi is a fast-paced board game for 2 players.

And the battles fought for this prize are a record of the changing face of how war was fought.<br/><br/>At the start of the 'war', the main forces were mounted men-at-arms and a tightly packed and closed formation of pike, especially as represented by the Swiss. But as battle churned into battle, that slowly changed. Firepower, in the form of the arquebus (an early musket) became increasingly prevalent and dominant, forcing the closed pike formations to open up, as the Spanish did (with sword and buckler), and the reliance on heavily mounted cavalry to decrease.<br/><br/>Arquebus shows all of this in true die-rolling glory, featuring 8 major battles: Fornovo, Cerignola, Agnadello, Ravenna, Marignano, Bicocca, Pavia, and Ceresole. These are all really great game-players, with all but two of them half-mappers playable in 3 hours or less. The other two are the 'tiny' page-sized (8&quot; x 11&quot;) Cerignola and the big one-mapper, the major, final battle of Pavia. Pavia was a crushing defeat wherein France lost over 50% of its army and almost all of its nobility of command, including her king, Francis I, who was captured. But for gamers, Pavia is wonderful gameplay, with units all over the greatly detailed map, much maneuver and many tough decisions to make.<br/><br/>Arquebus uses the popular &quot;Men of Iron&quot; mechanics with much concentration on detail of weaponry, from the differences between closed formation and open, to the decline of the Swiss (pas d'argent? pas de Suisse), and the rise of the German Landsknecht, the major force in warfare of the era and, ironically, the best-dressed men in Europe. Yes, Landsknecht uniforms literally set the fashion trend at the time for the entire western world.<br/><br/>"}, "198088": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Club Life", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"308141": "Windows/Mac/Linux Downloadable edition"}, "average": "7", "videogametheme": {"2494": "Romance / Relationships"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2713": "Visual Novel"}, "videogameplatform": {"5248": "Linux"}, "poll": {}, "description": "A reclusive student is forced into joining several clubs, can he make it through the year and will he gain any new friends along the way or even find love.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "198089": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Wand Wars", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"308142": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2328": "Occult"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Witches, wizards, demons and magical beasts compete for power and glory.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "198090": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Discovering Colors - Animals", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"308143": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2482": "Other"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Discovering Colors is a coloring game featuring fun animals!

Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for villainous NPCs as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.<br/><br/>"}, "198122": {"rpgitemversion": {"308192": "Saddle stapled Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Nell'Occhi del Ciclone", "rpgproducer": {"76920": "Francesca Marina Costa"}, "rpg": {"35239": "Walkthrough"}, "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "average": "0", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/>Nell'Occhio del Ciclone &egrave; un&rsquo;avventura inedita per il Gioco di Ruolo Walkthrough, suddivisa in due parti: la prima, con una trama classica scandita da un incalzante susseguirsi di eventi; la seconda, dove in un ambiente completamente esplorabile i Personaggi avranno un unico obiettivo: salvarsi la pelle!<br/><br/>English translation:<br/>Nell'Occhio del Ciclone is an adventure for the Walkthrough Roleplay, divided into two parts: the first, with a classic plot marked by a relentless succession of events; the second, where in a fully explorable environment the Characters will have one goal: to save his own lives!<br/><br/>"}, "198123": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Cosmophony", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"308194": "Windows/Macintosh/Linux Downloadable Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2977738.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2723": "Endless Runner"}, "videogameplatform": {"5248": "Linux"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2977738_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Moving down a tube, you shoot some obstacles and steer around others.

These items are perfect fodder for tomb robbers of every stripe, uncovering long-lost ruins once hidden by the sands or forbidden to outsiders, but now ready to join a daring rush into the dangerous marketplace of artifacts and antiquities. From glittering gold and lush lapis to alabaster, ivory, papyrus, and faience, the treasures of the pharaonic kingdom fire the imagination of treasure hunters the world over, who stand ready to defy mummy guardians, swarming scarabs, and eldritch curses that threaten doom upon any who would violate their sacred burial spaces. Their rest disturbed, tyrants and terrors that have long slumbered may rise to bring ruin upon lands that had forgotten them, but no warning or risk is too great when the plunder of dynasties awaits just behind the next dune.<br/><br/>This tome contains treasures of great value to tomb robbers and guardians alike, like the map cartouche and tomb warden's stele, along with deadly weapons like the scarab scourge and dune trap javelin to protective gear like the dynast aegis and mail of the radiant pharaoh. These items are redolent with the mysteries and magic of the desert, like the oasis mirror and faience idols to the alabaster icons of Bast and the canopic chest of eternal repose!

The Tcho-Tchos are a human-based faction representing the physically advanced, but ethically repulsive Tcho-Tcho tribe with the ability to interfere with other players by worshipping their Great Old Ones! Your own Great Old One, Ubbo-Sathla, is a tool and slave, not an object of worship!<br/><br/>Unique among Cthulhu Wars factions, the Tcho-Tchos have access to three high priests. In addition to the standard power generation and pacing benefits granted by recruiting additional high priests, the Tcho-Tchos exploit this advantage through two spellbooks (Hierophants and Martydom) based around high priests. The other distinction of the Tcho-Tchos is the way they interact with other factions; the spellbooks Tablet of the Gods and Idolotry enable the Tcho-Tcho faction to leech off other players, and Soulless makes your cultists less attractive to capture.<br/><br/>The Tcho-Tchos are generally weak defensively at first, but enemies are typically reluctant to attack an Area containing your High Priests (due to Martyrdom). If they don&rsquo;t send in Great Old Ones, the riff-raff can often be handled with Proto-Shoggoths--particularly with the Terror spellbook. The Tcho-Tchos have a major power advantage in the early game, because you normally spend 0 Power on your Great Old One. This power can be used not only to capture or build Gates, but to place units in enemy Start Areas to harass them with Tablets of the Gods.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"308328": "English first edition"}, "average": "8.52889", "name": "Cthulhu Wars: Tcho-Tcho", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "45", "expands": {"139976": {"name": "Cthulhu Wars"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "198206": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2980560.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"75112": {"name": "Ryan Cowler"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"83516": "Shaz Yong"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"26991": {"name": "Button Shy"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2980560_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1046": {"name": "Fighting"}}, "description": "In SuperP.L.E.X. Wrestling, players each take the role of an intergalactic pro wrestling superstar and battle it out with over-the-top moves in hopes of being the last wrestler standing!<br/><br/>Players start off by assembling their unique hand of 6 maneuver cards, which they will use as their arsenal in the battle ahead. Players also position their wrestlers on a &quot;Ring&quot;, which will become an important part of their assault, as where they and their opponent are in the ring at any given time could equal some BIG damage opportunities...if you play your moves right!<br/><br/>Played over the course of rounds, each round starts with a &quot;Lock-Up&quot; in order to determine who will start with the offensive edge. After the Lock-Up, each player then position their maneuver cards as &quot;Offense&quot; or &quot;Defense&quot; depending on who won the Lock-Up. One by one, players reveal their face down maneuver cards to see if the player on Defense was able to correctly guess what type of maneuver their opponent played. If they guess correctly, the opponent's maneuver is countered and the Defensive player now goes on the Offense! If they guessed wrong, the player on Offense gets to execute their maneuver!<br/><br/>Maneuvers become more and more deadly the further along in a combo they are, so do your best to juke and jive your Defensive opponent to get the most out of your combo! The wrestlers themselves get more deadly as well! Once a wrestler's stamina goes below 1/2, they get to add their super effective Finishing Maneuver card to their arsenal to help turn the tide of battle!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"308329": "First edition"}, "age": "8", "name": "Super Pocket League Extreme Wrestling", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "6.23125", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": {"27795": "Button Shy Wallet Games"}}, "198207": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3017929.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"90733": {"name": "R\u00fcdiger Hofrichter"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "10", "boardgameartist": {"17739": "Jay Forster"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2663": {"name": "Partizan Press"}}, "maxplaytime": "900", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3017929_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "TIN <br/>SOLDIERS <br/>IN ACTION<br/><br/>FAIR And SQAURE Rules<br/><br/>From 1680 Until About 1914<br/><br/>FAIR old school AND fast play rules, which are made for all sizes, shapes or organizations for the true passionate collector of tin soldiers, played on SQUARES!<br/><br/>Guiding principles of TIN SOLDIERS IN ACTION: <br/>Tin soldiers games should be fun and decisive &ndash;<br/><br/>     fair and fast <br/>     simple and harsh<br/>     clear verdicts<br/>     direct results<br/>     high adrenalin level<br/>     no discussion<br/>     no measuring<br/>     no vague situations<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Just decisions and a lot of FUN with TIN SOLDIERS IN ACTION!<br/><br/>TIN SOLDIERS IN ACTION, FAIR and SQUARES Rules cover  <br/><br/>     the age of Enlightenment<br/>     the Napoleonic age <br/>     the Victorian era<br/>     all scales<br/>     all types of basing <br/>     solo games<br/>     skirmishes and large battles with a single rule system. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Included are <br/><br/>     army lists from 1680 up to 1900 <br/>     point systems and modular systems for army constructions <br/>     a tutorial on the American Civil War in a military academy setting <br/>     a detailed scenario of the Battle of Bergen in the Seven Years War<br/>     a fantastic scenario Black Cup in the Victorian era in a Jules Verne setting<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Unique rules which will test YOUR courage:<br/><br/>YOU are commander-in-chief of YOUR tin soldiers, in charge of strategy, seizing the opportunities &ndash; every move must be a conscious act.<br/><br/>YOU are directly confronted with the stark consequences YOUR decisions.<br/><br/>Will YOU demonstrate true nerves of steel?

They are planetary champions, conquerors, heroes and messiahs, and they owe their vast gifts to the infusion of a few molecules of ancient, divine DNA.<br/><br/>All Lifechained creatures share a connection, however tenuous, to Phallus Space and its gods. Some Lifechained creatures are the direct descendants of one of the Third Pantheon&rsquo;s dieties, and even if they do not know it, can trace their heritage back aeons to the dawn of the Multiverse.<br/><br/>Others are hereditary royalty, a genetically superior planetary champion whose bloodline has been preserved through gene-treatments and selective incest, in the hopes of breeding a superior creature. Other Lifechains are the products of experimentation and reverse engineering- artificially grafting Lifechained DNA to a humanoid genome, or are products of strange magic that awakens the Lifechained DNA lurking in otherwise ordinary creatures. The most feared and spectacular Lifechains are the monstrous Nemesis Lifesapwn, super-predators which hunt the cosmos in search of Lifechained prey.<br/><br/>Players might choose to enter the Lifechain by selecting a species with an innate Lifechained heritage (including several of the player species found in [Species of the Otherverse] or Culture of Choice). Even if a character comes from a species not normally known for its connection to the Lifechain, that character can choose the Awakened Heritage feat to unlock their divine heritage. Once a Lifechained heritage is unlocked, a character can choose additional Lifechained feats, offering new capabilities, anytime a new feat slot opens up.<br/><br/>Lifechain feats grant amazing powers. Lifechained creatures can shapeshift into virtually any form, heal wounds that would kill entire platoons of mortals, manipulate energy, unleash primal sorcery, alter molecular structure and reality, and some wield even stranger abilities! However, power comes with a price. A Lifechained creature is easily detected by another Lifechain, and some Lifechained abilities allow a Lifechained hunter to more easily kill his demi-god brothers and sisters.<br/><br/>Powers of the Lifechain is a companion to Horrors of the Lifechain, foucsing on player abilities, where the earlier sourcebook was a collection of setting-specific monsters.<br/><br/>"}, "198462": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Culture of Choice", "rpgproducer": {"15781": "Christopher A.

The chess piece moves are intuitively and logically mapped by closely correlating adjacent and diagonal moves used by the traditional square Chess game. xChess has 2 openings, the Flatow opening can be played using a traditional set of pieces, having 2 bishops (all on the same diagonal grid) and the Fortress opening having 3 bishops (one for each diagonal grid) per side. The Game was refined over 2 years of intensive exploratory play by Canberra Chess enthusiasts and was self-published in 1976 in Australia.<br/><br/>The Flatow Chess Board and openings present the neatest and most compact form of Hexagonal Chess and xChess is the combination of the best openings and pawn variations discovered over the years.<br/><br/>The X in xChess stands for HeXagon, eXtra dimension, eXtra power, eXtra possibilities, eXtra fun and X Factor.<br/><br/>"}, "198466": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Blockbusters Gold Run", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"308752": "English / European Amstrad CPC Cassette edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2989993.jpg", "videogameseries": {"35307": "Blockbusters (Macsen)"}, "videogametheme": {"2350": "Movie, Book, TV show"}, "videogamegenre": {"2169": "Trivia"}, "average": "0", "videogamefranchise": {"35308": "Blockbusters"}, "videogameplatform": {"5203": "Amstrad CPC"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2989993_t.jpg", "description": "From the inlay:<br/><br/>GOLD RUN from Macsen Software is based on the well-known television series Blockbusters.

Students, one single and one team of two, would compete to answer questions to fill in hexagons on a grid. Each hexagon was filled with a letter, and the answer to the question started with that letter. If a team answered a question correctly it would turn their colour (white or blue) and they could then choose the next location on the grid, leading to the famous catchphrase &quot;Can I have a 'P' please, Bob?&quot; (having a Pee is British slang for urinating).<br/><br/>The aim of the game is for the single student (playing white) to connect from top to bottom, a minimum of four spaces, and for the pair of students to connect from left to right, a minimum of five spaces.<br/><br/>Winning would allow the team to progress to the Gold Run, where a single student (the pair would alternate if they won multiple times) would attempt to cross a more complicated version of the board.<br/><br/>The first game in the series was a two player game that played the main game only.
