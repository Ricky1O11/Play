Carson Ellis and Autumn de Wilde created a game board as a prop and called it The Illimat.<br/><br/>FLASH FORWARD TO 2015: The band, having played many board games on the road during their down time between soundcheck and show, decided to make this strange game-board-without-a-board-game into a real living, breathing game. Chris Funk from the band approached us at Twogether Studios to see what we could do. Keith Baker (creator of Gloom and Eberron) worked to make Illimat feel like an old forgotten card game that would be compelling to modern players: a game that feels of its time, yet weirdly out of time altogether.<br/><br/>Illimat is a card game for 2-4 players, and you can play a single hand in fifteen minutes. You win by collecting the most cards, which requires you to cultivate and combine sets of cards in the four fields of the board. The box the game comes in is also a component of the game: it sits in the center of the board and sets the seasons for each field, which affects the actions that can be taken. Turning the box and changing the seasons is a critical part of the strategy of the game.<br/><br/>Illimat has been playtested with devoted gamers and people who haven&rsquo;t played a game in years. The result is a game that&rsquo;s easy to learn, dynamic, and just a little bit addictive.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.58889", "name": "Illimat", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["217590"], "usersrated": "18", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#31: Terraforming Mars review &amp; on-tap; Dan, Live from Essen; Great American Beer Festival 2016", "Episode 191"]}, "210041": {"rpgartist": ["Jorge Gomez Arrausi", "Andrew Bosley", "Alex Cairns", "John Cason", "Hardy Fowler"], "statistics": [], "name": "Wyrd Chronicles (Issue 26 - Oct 2016)", "rpgdesigner": ["Sydney Engelstein", "Bob Kuzmeski", "Chip Limeburner", "Todd McNeal", "Marko Paunovic", "Adrian Scott"], "rpgproducer": ["Nathan Caroland", "John Cason", "Mason Crawford", "Lindsey Rode"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3203118.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": ["Wyrd Chronicles"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Contents / Credits", "Day of the Dead", "Foreword", "House on the Haunted Hill", "How to Lose at Malifaux", "Opposing Goals", "Paintng Asami", "The Forgotten", "Together"], "rpg": ["Through the Breach (1st and 2nd Editions)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Wyrd Miniatures"], "rpgissueversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3203118_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Check out the next installment, Wyrd Chronicles Vol. 26!<br/><br/>    How to Lose at Malifaux: Advice on the most common mistakes beginners make.<br/>    Together: A Malifaux love story.<br/>    Painting Asami: Learn to Freehand and blend using the Two Brush Technique.<br/>    Opposing Goals: See who will prevail in this life and death struggle.<br/>    House on Haunted Hill: Build your own Halloween inspired Haunted House.<br/>    The Forgotten: A Through the Breach adventure<br/>    Day of the Dead: Play through your own zombie apocalypse in this new scenario.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "210042": {"poll": [], "name": "The Da Vinci Code", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU PlayStation 2 edition", "EU Windows edition", "EU Xbox edition", "NA PlayStation 2 edition", "NA Windows edition", "NA Xbox edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Detective / Mystery", "Movie, Book, TV show", "Occult"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["The Collective, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "Windows", "Xbox"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["2K Games, Inc."], "description": "<br/>            User Summary***<br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The Da Vinci Code is an action-adventure game based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Dan Brown, which was also made into a movie.

It can be played with a little as 5 people, and as many as 52.<br/><br/>Set in the restless Kingdom of Ridian, the Assassins find themselves pitted against the rest of the King's court. Their goal? Kill everyone and get to the King! The kingdom is in dire need of a new leader, or so say the Assassins. The loyal subjects have banded together upon hearing rumors of an uprising. Their goal is to find and stop the Assassins before they can carry out their terrible purpose.<br/><br/>How to play <br/><br/>=<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>You need a Narrator<br/>Pass out cards to the other players<br/>Each player gets 1 card<br/>Keep your role secret!<br/>Make sure you have at least 1 Oracle, 1 Physician, and 1 Knight.<br/>At Night<br/><br/>The game starts out at night. The Narrator starts out by telling everyone to close their eyes (they are &quot;asleep&quot;). Then all the Assassins open their eyes and find each other. The narrator then goes one by one having each role open their eyes while everyone else keeps their eyes closed. Once the narrator knows who everyone is the game begins.<br/><br/>The Assassins choose a player to try and kill each night. They open their eyes and while and silently point to one player. They must all agree on the same player. Once the Assassins pick, they close their eyes and then its the Oracles turn.<br/><br/>The Oracle then gets a chance to look at any players card while everyone sleeps. Then the Physician has a chance to choose whether to use a potion to save or kill someone. Then the Wizard has a chance to redirect an attack.<br/><br/>During the night each player with an ability will have a chance to choose to use their skill or not. By using it you can directly effect the outcome of the game, but by waiting to use it, you may find a better time to use it, or just cause more confusion and mislead people. Information is your ally in this game so you want to reveal as little about yourself as possible, while learning as much as you can about everyone else!<br/><br/>During the Day<br/><br/>When everyone is done using (or not), their ability, everyone wakes up and the round resolves during daytime. The Narrator weaves a story about what happened during the night, and explains which people were saved, and which died.<br/><br/>When you die, you reveal your card to the rest of the group.<br/><br/>The Kingdom goes a bit crazy at this point! They know there are Assassins among them, but they don't know who they are. So, like any rational mob, they want to hang someone! With clues that were gathered during the night, people can now accuse others of being the Assassin.<br/><br/>When more than one person nominates the same player, they are qualified for being hanged. The player with the most nominations is hanged that day. If there is a tie, the two players have offer a defense and another vote is taken to determine who will survive to play another round.<br/><br/>If no one is nominated twice, then no one is hung that round, and the game continues to the next round.<br/><br/>Night once more<br/><br/>The game cycles through day and night, and players have a chance to use their powers to uncover the true identities of the Assassins! Each round gets more and more intense as the Assassins close in!<br/><br/>Winning<br/><br/>The Assassins win if they can kill everyone else. The Court wins when the defeat all the Assassins!<br/><br/>Keep your secrets close, and your wits about you!

This adventure is designd for a party of 4-6 characters of 4th level.  It provides a perfect transition from A Great Upheaval or other low-level adventures into the main storyline of Storm king's Thunder.  Besides opportunities for role playing and combat, the adventure introduces a bit of giant lore to the players.<br/><br/>In The Chosen, the characters meet the neighbors from hell.  An ettin priest, pregnant with the Chosen of Grolantor, and her mate have been hunting the lands around their home for the past two weeks &ndash; pillaging livestock from the farms in the area.  This adventure is designed for a party of 4-6 level 7 characters and can be placed seamlessly into the chapter 3 explorations of Storm King's Thunder.  The adventure subtly hints at the possible reorganization of the giant Ordning.<br/><br/>Giant Tales also includes two new magic items.  The Kongspira is a giant-sized ceremonial whetstone embued with the power of the Kong (king) rune.  The rune casting bowl gives a character the opportunity to become a seer - bloody viking fortune cookie prophecies!

Instead, Federation of Sol is a game that is ruled by the roll of the dice. This, along with its premise and goal, gives it a different feel; while other SoS games are primarily driven by surviving the onslaught of the deck, Federation of Sol is about not only withstanding outside pressures, but about driving outward and keeping what the Federation claims.<br/><br/>In Federation of Sol, humans (with you as their acting leader) have achieved the technology necessary for interstellar travel, giving us the capability to expand our empire beyond the solar system. However, it turns out that we are not alone in the universe! Four rival alien races &ndash; the Snakes, the Roaches, the Bots, and the People Eaters &ndash; are not too thrilled at the Federation's advancement into what they believe is their territory. Top that off with the lurking threat of a band of fearsome space pirates, a race to achieve the best technology, and the ever-shifting tides of diplomacy and war, and Federation of Sol is a game that &ndash; both literally and figuratively &ndash; takes place on a galactic scale.<br/><br/>Many things can go wrong on this journey. If an extraterrestrial ship is in Sol by the end of one's turn, the Earth is conquered and the humans will be lost to their new overlords. If Federation Stability drops to zero, anarchy will reign supreme. If all of the aliens achieve technology beyond what humanity could ever dream of, then mankind will be utterly outclassed and unable to progress outside of the solar system.<br/><br/>But even with all of these ways to fail, the humans are determined, and if we take over the exoplanets in the various enemy territories, we will have an established foothold in galactic affairs for millennia to come. However, to do this we must build ships and stations, maneuver those ships to other worlds, research new technologies, spy on the advancements of our rivals, and keep up morale. Meanwhile, the political tides of the aliens are always in constant flux; perhaps if they do go to war, that could be used to our advantage....<br/><br/>"}, "210162": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Andrew Franke"], "poll": [], "name": "Legions and Barbarians", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Chit-Pull System"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "Ravensworth Press"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Ancient", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Tactical game of combat between the legions of Rome and the various barbarian tribes of Europe, England and Scotland.<br/><br/>The game is designed to be played by two players and completed in 30-60 minutes per battle.<br/>This is the first game in the 60 Minutes to Victory series.<br/><br/>"}, "210163": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3359458.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Shem Phillips"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Mihajlo Dimitrievski"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Games Factory", "Garphill Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3359458_t.png", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Medieval", "Nautical"], "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In Raiders of the North Sea: Hall of Heroes, a mead hall has been constructed, attracting a new breed of adventurers.

Games were said to last from hours to days.  It was routinely played (and continuously modified) by society members until about the advent of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  Many game proponents created implementations of the game, all with hand-drawn art from Jack Harness, some with minor rules variations.<br/><br/>In 2016, Lee Gold and Barry Gold converted their personal extant copy into electronic format.  This involved a general revision for clarity and format of the not-inconsiderable rule book, as well as a production of a color electronic playing board.  This version was published for free download, intended for print-and-play use.  In addition to the revised and cleaned-up game, a scan of the original products also was made available.<br/><br/>The game is intriguing as a very early example of a basic type of role-playing game prior to the commercial advent of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br/><br/>"}, "210210": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 1"], "poll": [], "name": "Machinations", "rpgdesigner": ["Bradley Lester"], "rpgproducer": ["Creighton Broadhurst", "Eric Menge", "Samuel D.

The Mordheim Nemesis Crown development team led by Mark Havener authored the supplement. It was last official Mordheim expansion featuring some of the game's original contributors to be published digitally by Games Workshop. It followed the same story composed by Andy Hoare for Warhammer, through a series of campaign scenario concepts designed by Stuart Cresswell.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Great Forest where the race for the artefact known as the Nemesis Crown has begun. Lying deep within the heart of the Empire, the locale presents a problem for the Vampire Counts, the Skaven Lords, the Chaos Champions and the other warlords who would search for the fabled relic. Marching an army roughshod through the lands of the Empire would be a foolish and inefficient use of resources. If these races are to scour the very heart of the land then stealth and subterfuge will be required. And being a dark, dense, tangled and vast area of wilderness, the Great Forest contains many areas too wild and remote for even the Empire's own armies to access. Thus the responsibility for scouring for clues will often fall to small foraging parties, operating beneath the gaze of the armies who march upon the region.<br/><br/>The Mordheim Nemesis Crown development team were; Ian Davies, John Severn, Chris Templin, Mark Havener, Mike Kitch, Stuart Cresswell, Terry Maltman &amp; Tommy Muller.

You need a character sheet, right now.<br/><br/>Welcome to Instant Character!  Just add a player, and go!  In this product, you will discover twenty complete stat blocks for a single PC, level 1 through 20, adhering to the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game rules.  The core format adheres to the standard non-player character (NPC) stat block most GMs are already familiar with minus the Tactics section.  This makes it easier for the GM to assist with finding information and also prepares the player for the day he or she is running games!  The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.  Sources for spells, races, classes, archetypes, and prestige classes from sources other than the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&trade; (PZO1110) are listed in the Sources section and can be referenced in the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Reference Document.<br/><br/>At the end of this document is a sheet of character and spell tokens including a token for this character and assorted Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and spell effects.  For best results, print the token page and laminate the entire sheet.  Initially cut out into squares.

Limanowa &ndash; where the legendary Hungarian cavalryman Ottm&aacute;r Muhr died a hero&rsquo;s death heading his glorious hussars while protecting Jabloniec Hill, situated next to the town, with his men until their last breath against the Russian attackers. Limanowa &ndash; where the fortunes of war took a turn following the battle, later enabling the Central Powers to launch the offensive operations that culminated in the &ldquo;Gorlice breakthrough&rdquo;, bringing about the much-awaited victory. Limanowa &ndash; where we can now play out the World War I battle again and even rewrite history. Will Austro-Hungarian forces again succeed in reining in the &ldquo;Russian Steamroller&rdquo;? Or will the glorious victory be earnt this time by the Russian Empire&rsquo;s soldiers?<br/><br/>Heroes of Limanowa is a World War I strategy board game for 2 to 4 players. The gameboard &ndash; the battlefield &ndash; covers the region surrounding Limanowa, Gorlice and B&aacute;rtfa, where the clashes, in reality, took place in December 1914 unfold during the game. Players personify the commanders of four different army corps as two opposing parties: Austro-Hungarian units are at war with the forces of the Russian Empire. Accordingly, the Austro-Hungarian side can opt to stand ground as commander of the Hadfy Group, tasked with protecting Limanowa against the &ldquo;Russian Steamroller&rdquo;, or as commander of the Szurmay Group forging ahead in the Carpathians. On the other hand, any player may assume command of the Russian Army Corps VIII sieging Limanowa or the Russian Army Corps VII, fighting against the Szurmay Group in the Carpathians.<br/><br/>The gameboard features clashes&rsquo; locations and topographic conditions, including forests, heights, settlements, as well as roads and railways of strategic importance, with high precision. Units can be deployed to battle or organized into defensive position taking endowments of terrain into account. Players may use three different types of unit &ndash; infantry, cavalry and artillery units &ndash; in combat.<br/>Beyond these, all army corps possess 3-3 officer&rsquo;s units (Hadfy, Brusilov, Szurmay, Orlov, etc.), which have unique capabilities and sport the strongest combat value. Together with officer&rsquo;s units, the game contains some 70 miniature figures. In their operative concepts, players are assisted by various battle cards featuring combat plans. The total of 100 battle cards can be divided into three large groups: strategic cards, tactical cards and artillery cards.<br/><br/>In the course of the game, both parties aim to achieve final victory, which can be met through taking control of settlements indicated among strategic targets, the complete annihilation of an enemy corps or liquidating all enemy units. On the path to the ultimate goal, the winners of all minor clashes receive extra rewards; thus, further battle cards can be acquired with winding up an enemy unit or seizing a settlement listed among strategic targets.<br/>Prepare for war and break the resistance of the enemy! Run down your foe with your fearless hussars or death-defying Cossacks and destroy its artillery units or prowl in his hinterland behind the frontline! Launch a sweeping charge with your infantry or use your machine-gunners to chip away your enemy&rsquo;s momentum!

Rise Up is a cooperative board game about building people power and taking on oppressive systems to create change.<br/><br/>In Rise Up, the game weaves a story about your movement, which can either be based in reality (like stopping an oil pipeline) or fictional (like fighting for dragon rights). But &ldquo;the System&rdquo; is hard at work too, maneuvering to crush your efforts through tactics like setting up surveillance, making arrests, or causing infighting.<br/><br/>In order to win, players must collaborate to build a movement that scores more victories than the system. To do this, players spend supporter tokens to use Movement Cards that allow them to grow their movement power on the ten different locations on the board (such as Workplaces, Campuses, Internet), take down the System&rsquo;s power, as well as help their fellow players gain more supporters and cards. Players can strategize together by playing Movement Cards with matching symbols and starting a &ldquo;chain of events,&rdquo; which increases their impact. As your movement gains power, the system will retaliate with more cards of its own. Everyone loses if any one player runs out of supporter tokens, or if the system scores too many victories.<br/><br/>Rise Up also comes with two versions with a double sided board: one for more experienced game players, and one for novices as well as younger children.

These enemies may engage in physical brutality and slaughter, but some prefer secretive and subtle seduction and sedition, like the sinister spirit naga and the ghostly bhuta whose very touch is corruption.
