Every game involves you directly in the greatest story that&rsquo;s never been written; where your character is the hero (or the villain?!) in a story that is not predetermined because it unfolds and changes as the characters actions change the fictional world around them.<br/><br/>Think of a play, movie, or better yet a radio drama broadcast. The core of a real RPG is to play the role of a Player Character (PC); similar to how an actor plays the role of a character in a play or a movie. However you don't actually put on a costume and physically act out the game; that's why a radio broadcast is a better analogy because everyone at the table uses narration to play their role. The players are similar to actors in a play while the Game Master (GM) is like the director of a play and is essentially just another player at the table but with a distinctly different role. The GM's role is first to make sure people are having fun! Secondly the GM adjudicates decisions and interprets rules. For every action there is a reaction; players declare actions that their characters take and the GM describes the reactions that occur.<br/><br/>A player declares their character struts to the bar, hollers for the bartender, so they may order a drink... the GM describes how the bartender reacts, walks over, and addresses the player... now a conversation between the bartender and the player&rsquo;s character ensues. As you can see the GM is also an actor at times and will have to play the role of many Non Player Characters (NPCs)<br/><br/>From this example you may wonder why we need any rules or guidelines at all? What more is there than to Role Play like this example? As another example; the player declares their character will try and use diplomacy in order to talk the bartender in to selling five pitches of mead at a discount; the bartender has no intention of selling at a discount since he wishes to make a profit&hellip;. How do we determine who&rsquo;s will is stronger? This is where the rules come in to play; players will use special dice to roll numbers that will be checked against another number to determine the outcome. If the player&rsquo;s dice rolls succeed then the character gets a discounted price but if the player&rsquo;s dice rolls fail then he must pay full price. This is why the story is unpredictable; there is no script and the story may go any number of directions!<br/><br/>You may question this situation by thinking &lsquo;why not just have the player and game master role play their characters and the player should try to convince the game master through this debate&rsquo;. There is nothing stopping players from agreeing that this is how they would prefer to play. However players also have a good argument to say that dice rolls and using characters ability modifiers to those dice rolls are a preferred method of resolution. This is because players are not their characters; there is a distinct difference. Sometimes players will have characters with ability scores that are way beyond what a real human is capable of or for a real human to comprehend; so how do you play out a role you can&rsquo;t truly comprehend? That&rsquo;s where dice rolls and modifiers can play a key role; you may wish to use your characters super-human intelligence to think of convincing the bartender to sell the character drinks at a discount. You would then use the rules and dice rolls to determine whether or not the character actually achieved this or if the character failed.<br/><br/>A lot of actions declared by players and GMs do not even require dice rolls. A good rule of thumb is to consider almost all actions are successful if there is no threat or opposition. If there is no time limit or no opponent threatening a character then they can take the time to do an action correctly and all the GM has to do is describe the reactions. Now if there is a threat like a time limit or an opponent then you should to start rolling dice; or if an action is opposed by another character then you should roll to see who wins. For example a player says their character tries to tell a lie (bluff) and convince someone it's the truth; that action is opposed by the other character as they are trying to sense the motive (sense motive) of the character telling them the lie. This is another situation where the rules and dice are used to determine who fails and who succeeds.<br/><br/>"}, "141346": {"rpg": {"22117": "PathfinderLITE"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "PathfinderLITE Players Compendium", "rpgproducer": {"68033": "Morgan Mains"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1632494.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"206709": "v2 DOC"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1632494_t.png", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>A collection of commonly used rules for use by the Player as well as character generation information.<br/><br/>"}, "141347": {"rpg": {"22117": "PathfinderLITE"}, "poll": {}, "name": "PathfinderLITE Barbarian", "rpgproducer": {"68033": "Morgan Mains"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1632495.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"206710": "v2 DOC"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpgseries": {"22128": "PathfinderLITE Core Classes"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1632495_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>For some, there is only rage.

Players pick up masterwork weapons early on and have fun with them. Some invest in the +1 weapon, whilst others begin to pick up all sorts of fun toys. Much later, those who got toys finally get a +2 weapon, while the fellow who focuses on weapons may have a +3 weapon and nothing else. Frankly, weapons simply don't do interesting things in the early game, and the more interesting something is, the more fun the player has. The person focusing on the weapon is essentially playing for the future the entire time. Let's bring that individual to the NOW, shall we?<br/><br/>The simple solution to this is to have the ability to add a weak free ability to any weapon that has a +1 enhancement bonus or greater. It allows players to have more options, while also allowing the DM to slap fun and interesting powers onto randomly generated +1 weapons (and we know every campaign has far too many of those). That being said, beware, for each ability also carries a hefty penalty with it. Perhaps you don't get critical damage. Perhaps your enhancement bonus to damage is a bonus to something else instead. Maybe you need to spend multiple full round actions charging some moderately powerful effect. ...Maybe the weapon just slowly tears itself apart.<br/><br/>This product contains 20 +0 weapon modifiers / special abilities as well as rules on how to integrate them into your game.<br/><br/>     Acidic - Rather than dealing additional damage on a critical hit, this weapon launches gouts of alchemical acid.<br/>     Dazing - Rather than dealing additional damage on a critical hit, this weapon dazes foes of 4 HD and under.<br/>     Debilitating - Rather than dealing additional damage on a critical hit, this weapon imposes a saving throw penalty to wielder and victim.<br/>     Dense - +1 sunder, -2 CMD<br/>     Flaring - Rather than dealing additional damage on a critical hit, this weapon dazzles the victim.<br/>     Hooked - +1 disarm, -2 CMD<br/>     Jittery - The weapon's enhancement bonus to damage is now to initiative<br/>     Least Spell Storing - As Spell Storing, but only 1st level spells and under.

It is impossible to inject all the complexities of modern-day farming into this game, yet it does contain enough reality to be educational to the nonfarming-oriented person and at the same time provide a competitive and fun atmosphere for all.  As you play the game, you can to some degree sense the frustrations that farmers face but yet realize the real competitive situation that farming has come to be, neighbor versus neighbor and, likewise, player versus player.  You might note that virtually all the option positions in the game are akin to decisions that farmers must make.  While playing the game you will find that what you thought was the best decision would later not be so, as the real life farmer has experienced so many times.  Another likeness of the game to farming is that your destiny depends on when and where you are.&quot;<br/><br/>From the Object of the Game: &quot;The object of the game is to buy and sell production as each player takes his turn.  Production is defined as Corn, Soybeans, Wheat Cows, and Hogs.  Commodities are defined as Corn, Wheat, and Soybeans.  Livestock is defined as Cows and Hogs.  Each player should try to buy as cheaply as possible and sell as high as possible as he stops on various spots around the board in order to accumulate the enough money to buy all the production that belongs on a player's farm.  Players should keep in mind that they must make several transactions in order to buy their production and, at the same time, retain enough assets to take care of the expenses that will surely come their way.  The first play to buy all production for their farm is the winner.  Each farm's production consists of 1 bin of Wheat, 1 bin of Corn, 1 bin of Soybeans, 1 Cow, and 1 Hog.  Bins are identified by colors.  Yellow represents Corn bins, Light Gold represents Soybean bins, and Dark Gold represents Wheat bins.  As a player buys these commodities, he may place them in their respective places on the board and, likewise, the same for livestock.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "141385": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Tower of the Scarlet Wizard", "rpgproducer": {"1615": "Chris Clark (I)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1632868.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"206761": "PDF version"}, "average": "8", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1632868_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A mysterious and magical message literally drops into your lap from the very air.

Your pond is public, but your house is secret. To win, you have to be...coy!<br/><br/>Each turn, players take turns drawing a card from the face-down deck or from the face-up &quot;lake&quot; until everyone has three new cards in hand. Then all players simultaneously choose from amongst their entire hand one card to add to their personal pond and one to discard to their personal &quot;river&quot;. Cards in your river will eventually go to the lake, so choose carefully.<br/><br/>After six turns, the round ends. Score points by comparing the total number of koi of a suit in your pond and your house. Score points equal to the *lower* number. Score each suit of koi in this manner. If a crane, housecat or turtle is in your pond, you score bonus points for koi of that noted suit in your opponent's pond (crane), house (housecat) or river (turtle). Which opponent depends on the number of players and the current round.<br/><br/>After each round, ribbons are awarded to the player with the most koi of each suit in her river. Ribbons grant bonus points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>To maximize your koi score, you have to carefully balance the populations in your pond and house. A turtle, housecat, or crane earns points from an opponent's hard work, but they also take valuable space in your hand. Sending high value koi cards to your river earns more ribbons, but also makes them available to all players in the next round. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"263575": "Chinese first edition"}, "name": "Koi Pond: A Coy Card Game", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "171", "average": "6.93977"}, "141420": {"rpgitemversion": {"206847": "English A4 PDF Edition"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dicecards", "rpgproducer": {"39478": "Ian Millington"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561282.png", "usersrated": "3", "average": "9.33333", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"22132": "The Dicecards Mini-RPG"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561282_t.png", "description": "From the Back of the Pack:<br/><br/>Dicecards are a complete dice bag in a deck of cards.

After decades of steady progress, Japan began its own practice of colonialism, defeating China in 1894. As the Japanese began to infiltrate the semi-independent Kingdom of Korea, they ran into Russian agents doing the same. Despite Japanese offers to negotiate, elements within the Russian Empire were set on war.<br/><br/>Great War at Sea: Russo-Japanese War covers the naval aspects of the resulting conflict, which opened with a Japanese surprise attack on the Russian Pacific Fleet&rsquo;s base at Port Arthur in northern China. There are 50 scenarios, including the climactic Battle of Tsushima, as well as hypothetical actions ranging from an early dispute resulting from the 1895 &quot;Triple Intervention&quot; to a showdown in 1906 with greatly reinforced Russian and Japanese fleets.<br/><br/>The Russian fleet is a mixed bag of modern battleships and ancient ironclads better suited for a museum. The Pacific Fleet that begins the game in the Far East has modern ships stationed at Port Arthur and a cruiser squadron in Vladivostok. Between them lies Korea, occupied by Japan. The Russian strategic situation is difficult.<br/><br/>The Japanese have a better fleet; though not as large, their armored cruisers outclass their Russian counterparts and their torpedo boats are more numerous and more effective. They are also better-led after the death of the Russian Admiral Makarov.<br/><br/>The map covers the Japanese home islands and the seas around them. As with other games in the series, it&rsquo;s divided into zones 32 miles across. Fleets attempt to locate one another on this map. When contact is made, play moves to a tactical map where ships maneuver and fight.<br/><br/>The previous edition of this game (Great War at Sea: 1904-1905) won the Origins Award for Best Historical Game due to play balance and simplicity. Without aircraft, play is even faster than in other games in the series. The strategic situation is challenging to both players, and competitive balance is keen without sacrificing the historical accuracy of the game as a simulation. Unlike most wars, the Russo-Japanese naval war took place between opponents reasonably matched in terms of vessels and numbers (albeit not in training), and that makes for a tense and exciting game.<br/><br/>Russo-Japanese War includes:<br/>&bull; One 34 x 22-inch operational map<br/>&bull; One 22 x 22-inch tactical map<br/>&bull; 210 playing pieces<br/>&bull; A game booklet including 50 scenarios<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"206903": "First Edition"}, "average": "7.75", "name": "Great War at Sea: Russo-Japanese War", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "10", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"46": "Great War at Sea"}}, "141453": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Marble Flip", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"206904": "North American Windows edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Twist and turn your way to the next level!

Only capturing your opponent's lion does.<br/>- You can't have two of your own chicks in the same column/file.<br/>- You can't drop a chick for mate.<br/><br/>Taken from the publisher's website:<br/><br/>The cute animal pieces are now combined with Goro-Goro Shogi, a small shogi on 5x6 square board. This is a very good next step for everyone who has played Dobutsu Shogi.<br/><br/>The rules of Goro-Goro Shogi was invented by Japan Shogi Association, and is widely known to be a very good variation of shogi to learn important concepts in shogi, such as handling the generals effectively, importance of promoting a pawn, and mating the opponent's king with successive piece drops.<br/><br/>Cats and dogs run and play in this small board.

Su Doku (or Sudoku) is a mathematical puzzle which consists of a grid of 9 3x3 squares. The completed puzzle has the digits 1 to 9 in each 3x3 square and the digits 1 to 9 in each row and column in the grid. The game poses a number of partially complete grids which must be completed correctly and can be used in either the solo puzzle or two player game.<br/><br/>The solo mode allows a player to attempt to correctly complete a Su Doku. This function of the set is not technically a game and is actually solo puzzle solving.<br/><br/>The two player mode sees both players attempting to complete the same puzzle in the same grid. Players may place a tile as soon as they are sure that the placement is correct; there is no turn sequence.

Centuries of peace had lasted throughout Lambda, the various Sheep Systems have settled their remaining differences, and the sector has seen a golden age of prosperity and scientific advancement. With the era of scientific enlightenment came the creation of the Spatial Sheep Distortion Drive, supplanting the now-outdated Warp Drive. The ships outfitted with such operate both independently and synchronously with System bases to enable the crossing of vast distances in relatively short amounts of time. With this, the races of the Systems were brought even closer together. Commerce and cultural trade were at an all-time high, and families allowed their Sheeplings to roam free across the neighboring regions without fear.<br/><br/>All was well in the galaxy &ndash; until the first messenger ship arrived from a force that has become known only as &quot;Wolf&quot;. Its language was unintelligible, but its message was clear: complete and total annihilation of Sheepkind. Soon after, the first Wolf ships arrived, laying waste to the satellite planets of the Sheep Home Systems. Front-line galactic defense forces were able to stave off further destruction &ndash; but what is coming is far, far more terrifying than any threat faced in the galaxy's known history.<br/><br/>All Systems have been placed under Red Alert, with the Strategic Sheep Command called together and a Flock Commander named. As members of Wolf have been spotted in Sheep Commanders' uniform, SSC has determined that the best way of insulating the individual Systems is by outlawing all usage of the Spatial Sheep Distortion drives. Inter-system access is granted only to the Elite &quot;Shepherd&quot; class ships, via a complex network of Hyperspace travel. A fleet of these specialized ships has been assigned to recover the Sheeplings and return them to their Home Systems while the Wolf invasion is repelled.<br/><br/>You are a Sheep.<br/>You are a Defender in the Strategic Sheep Command.<br/>You have trained all of your career for this moment in history.<br/>You will issue Tactics to the Shepherd Fleet to direct the Rescue Mission.<br/>You know how to defeat Wolf &ndash; &quot;Ewe's The Force...&quot;<br/><br/>Space Sheep! is a real-time, customizable, cooperative game &ndash; with possible traitor(s) in your midst &ndash; for 1-8 players. The Defenders want to get the Space Sheep tokens and Shepherd tokens back to their matching Systems before all the cards are gone and time has run out. (If playing with Infiltrators, thus making the game semi-cooperative, each player receives a secret allegiance card; each player knows only her own allegiance, leaving her to guess and decipher who else is on her team.)<br/><br/>In Space Sheep!, on each player's turn, the player will play a card from her hand, allowing her to:<br/><br/><br/>     Activate a System and take the action associated with it (moving the Space Sheep and Shepherds),<br/>     Play a card to move a Shepherd clockwise, or<br/>     Play any card face down to the Defense Mat.<br/><br/><br/>Additionally, a player may play a card matching the System occupied by the Wolf to attack (and knock the Wolf token on its side).<br/><br/>In Space Sheep!, one player acts as the Supreme Flock Commander, managing the one-minute sand timer. If the sand runs out, Wolf attacks and players must discard cards from the Defense Mat, the deck, or their hands; if they can't, they lose the game. If the Wolf token has been knocked on its side, the Supreme Flock Commander may flip the sand timer before it runs out to avoid the Wolf attack, standing up the Wolf token and moving it to another System in the process.<br/><br/>Players who are Infiltrators will, of course, be attempting to delay action, make poor moves, and subtly manipulate the other players into making poor choices of their own. At any time players may point at one another in an accusatory fashion. If more than half the players simultaneously point at one player, this player is out of the game. He then reveals his Allegiance and:<br/><br/><br/>     If players have found an Infiltrator, shuffle the player's cards in hand and place them on the bottom of the deck.<br/>     If players have found a Defender, place the player's cards in hand on the face-down discard pile. On the ousted player's turn, Wolf attacks.<br/><br/><br/>If the Defenders get all shepherds and space sheep to their matching systems, then they win the game. If the sand timer runs out and players can't discard enough cards &ndash; or if the number of Infiltrators matches the number of Defenders in the game &ndash; then the Infiltrators win.<br/><br/>Players can customize Space Sheep! by varying the number of Systems in play (more Systems = more complexity), the number of tactic cards in the deck (fewer cards = greater difficulty), the strength of Wolf, the ratio of Infiltrators to Defenders, and the types of direction cards (more directions = greater variability).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"205950": "English first edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Space Sheep!", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "average": "5.41633", "usersrated": "203", "boardgamefamily": {"7481": "Animals: Sheep"}}, "141036": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Captain's Log #22", "boardgameauthor": {"675": "Stephen V.

The player must activate the Ultras (i.e. turn them at a 90-degree angle) when he/she uses them. Once activated, the Ultras can no longer be used. Therefore, the player must not activate all his/her Ultras during his/her turn, since the activated Ultras will not be able to defend during the opponent&rsquo;s turn. When the player chooses to play an action, he/she must cast a 12-sided die and add the Ultra&rsquo;s personal bonus for the action chosen. To know whether the action succeeds or not, the player compares the total to a success threshold, which must be exceeded or not depending on the type of action.<br/>The Interaction card may be used at any time to strengthen one&rsquo;s own Ultras or weaken the opponent&rsquo;s Ultras. <br/>When the turn begins, the player draws 1 Interaction card and set all his/her Ultras upright. First, he/she can replace Ultras and have 2 Ultras swap place. He/she can then use the Ultras and Interaction cards.<br/>When the player can no longer or does no longer want to carry out any action, or when he/she scores a goal, his/her turn ends and the opponent can begin his/her turn.<br/>The game goes on until one of the players scores 3 goals.<br/><br/>"}, "141055": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Inferno", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"206018": "English/European DOS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1628986.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2331": "Space"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2295": "Flight Simulator"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1628986_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>You are humanity's greatest space pilot, commander of the most potent craft in the universe.

Nevertheless, throughout the 1800&rsquo;s and early 1900&rsquo;s, periodic tensions arose between the two North American neighbors, whether over direct political, territorial or trade concerns or (in most cases) by extension of the rivalry between the United States and the British Empire.  With the right spark, history might once again have found the Great Lakes area becoming a fortified region between the U.S. and the Dominion of Canada, with modern steel warships cruising the interconnected freshwater bodies of Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario.<br/><br/>Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Crimson is a complete boxed game in the Great War at Sea series, that examines this unusual alternate history in which the United States and the Dominion of Canada rearm for conflict on and around the Great Lakes over the period 1900-1922. Taking its name from the 1930 U.S. Army-Navy Joint Board War Plan Red color designation for Canada (&ldquo;Crimson&rdquo;), the game presents hypothetical warships designed for service in the unique environment of the lakes, and characterizes the potential actions for control of the region through 12 battle and 22 operational  scenarios.  All of the pieces necessary to play the game are present: a 24 x 28-inch operational map of the Great Lakes region including lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan and Superior, a 24 x 24-inch tactical map, 50 &quot;long&quot; double-sized ship pieces and 180 standard-sized pieces, all of them laser-cut and mounted.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"206029": "Second Edition"}, "average": "7", "name": "Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Crimson (Second Edition)", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"46": "Great War at Sea"}}, "141059": {"boardgamedesigner": {"67989": {"name": "Marcia Gresko"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamehonor": {"22626": "2013/Spring Parents' Choice Silver Honor Winner"}, "name": "Shelby's Snack Shack Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": {"7349": "Animals: Dogs"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1634473_t.jpg", "average": "4.73214", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"765": {"name": "Educational Insights"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1634473.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"206030": "Educational Insights First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Shelby buried bones on the beach and needs your help collecting them.

He has identified four local youths who have started showing signs of talent to control the elements.  If they can learn to develop and harness this power in time, Elderwood can be saved!<br/><br/>In Mythic Mages: Defenders of Elderwood, players take on the role of apprentice mages who must learn the ways of magic and use these new skills to save the village from certain destruction.

Your instructions are to carry the war to the enemy in the manner you best see fit, but not so as to endanger either the realm or the royal purse. If you fail, there will be... displeasure. Your duties commence at once. Do not return without victory.<br/><br/>In 1741, while the rest of Europe involved itself in yet another interminable succession war, Sweden and Russia squared off in yet another of their own squabbles for dominance in the Baltic. The Russian monarchy was unstable, and a cabal of Swedish hawks - whose party was known as the Hats - sought to replace the current empress with one friendly to Sweden. France, Sweden's paymaster, encouraged the plan, hoping to distract Russia from affairs in Europe. The Swedes would claim some of the territory taken from them during the Great Northern War. Either the new empress would grant them the land out of gratitude for their aid, or their armies would simply take it. It was a daring plan, and one beyond Sweden's means. And yet it came very close to success. The coup went off as planned, but the Russian Army, led by one of Europe's best marshals - Peter Lacy of County Clare - struck first, upsetting the Swedish timetable. Instead of the Swedish army managing the palace coup from the Winter Palace, it was floundering in the snows of Karelia when the new regime took power. Now, unable to acquire the territory they desired through negotiations, the Hats foolishly challenged the full might of Russia to a trial of arms...<br/><br/>The Russo-Swedish War of 1741-1743, otherwise called the Hats' War or the War of the Hats, has to be the most obscure conflict Red Sash Games has tackled so far. Measured by the butcher's bill, it was hardly a minor one, however, with something like 50,000 casualties. Historically, it was a fiasco for the Swedes, but partly this was due to bad luck - an epidemic ravaged their fleet - and partly due to internal politics. Surely, as the Swedish generalissimo, YOU can do better? If you choose to play the Russians instead, you will have many, many troops, and excellent commanders to lead them, but you will be faced by deadlines as the diplomats are already discussing peace terms. Will you be able to make a name for yourself before they pull the curtain down?<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>ALW is a two-player operational study of the War of the Hats, fought between the Swedes and the Russians in the years 1741-1743. Included in the game is a set of the latest basic rules, charts, and tables (version 3.75) for the Lace Wars system.<br/><br/>A few key concepts in this system include Operations Points, Campaign Plans, Prestige, and Auxiliaries. Operations Points are accumulated during periods of inactivity, in order to be spent during the course of active campaigning. If a player is unable or unwilling to spend OPs, his forces suffer attrition instead. The further forces are from their base of operations, the more severe the penalties will be. Whoever has the most OPs also has the initiative.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the Operations Phase, where the players alternate moving their formations, laying siege to fortresses and engaging in battle with the enemy field forces. The players have a degree of flexibility in what they do with their forces, but they are constrained by the Campaign Plan or plans that they choose. These dictate what objectives (usually fortresses) must be taken. A successfully completed plan will garner Prestige for a player. At the end of the game, the player with the highest prestige wins. In addition, bonuses can be won for victory in battle, and these may be used to buy rewards that improve a player's chances, or be used as influence.<br/><br/>The combat system has a tactical feel - while not a full sub-system with battlefield maps, it addresses the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Winning a battle will bring you the acclaim of your noble peers, but may not gain you any strategic advantage; losing a battle can be catastrophic.<br/><br/><br/>Sommar Skr&aring;la - The Baltic, 1741-1743<br/><br/>Sommar Skr&aring;la is the second of a set of games covering the Age of Sail at an Operational level. While the War of the Austrian Succession raged elsewhere in Europe, and around the globe, in the Baltic Sweden and Russia faced off in the little known War of the Hats. At one level, the war had been engineered by France to keep Russia from helping Austria, but at another level, it was a war to reclaim Sweden's lost empire. The war was poorly managed by Sweden, and for a number of reasons they suffered a catastrophe of the first water &ndash; especially, the war was begun to help a Russian princess overthrow the current dynasty (in return for territorial concessions that were not forthcoming); a war with such an object was sure to be a confused affair.<br/><br/>Sommar Skr&aring;la also examines the possibility of Danish intervention. In reality, the Danish Prince Royal was an heir-presumptive candidate for the Swedish crown (the Swedes having an elective monarchy), and the Danish King assembled men and ships to help Sweden defend this choice against Russia. But Sweden, in the end chose a candidate favored by Russia (as the price of peace) and the Danes very nearly went to war against Sweden instead.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Sommar Skr&aring;la is a two player strategy game. You command either the Swedish or Muscovite (Russian) fleets. Orders are handed down to you from your Admiralty, and you must try to fulfill them within the framework of the wider war, which is represented by a set of events. Your opponent will have orders of his own to fulfill, but with his spare forces he will be attempting to foil your plans. Success will earn you Prestige (victory points), and may even have an impact on the land campaign. You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike, organizing your &quot;sail&quot; (ships) into squadrons, and your squadrons into flotillas commanded by leaders (commodores and admirals). Maintaining sufficient forces at &quot;battle readiness&quot; is critical, but very difficult, since ships constantly suffer wear and tear &ndash; a battle may be won and the campaign lost. Scenarios are one year (16 turns) long, playable in 3-4 hours (the number of counters in play is quite small). The campaign game consists of a number of years pre-chosen by the players. A special campaign scenario allows the players to link Sommar Skr&aring;la with its companion Lace Wars game &ndash; A Lesser Wrath.<br/><br/>"}, "141170": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Lost Adventures of Kroz", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"206308": "DOS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2211147.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5877": "Kroz"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"141003": "Kroz Free"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2211147_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The Lost Adventures of Kroz is the final installment in the Kroz series of games.

Meyer's men passed through the city center and held a blocking position despite being surrounded for two days, armed with the new MG 42 belt fed machine guns aided greatly in their defense, until contact was reestablished by a sister battalion commanded by Major Peiper. Lt. General Rybalko's forces in the city were composed of a Tank Brigade and NKVD security troops of his Third Tank Army. General Rybalko ordered his units to block the German units from moving through the city, establishing defense lines along the small river meandering through Kharkov. The local militias were called up to aid in the defense of the city and many were thrown piece meal against the SS units armed with new &quot;wonder&quot; weapons. Those new weapons included the MG 42, whose rate of fire almost doubled over the previous MG 34, from 600-800 rpm to 1100 to 1200 rpm. The German forces would begin to have a new type of problem, an inability to maintain a high enough level of supply of ammunition to take advantage of the high rate of fire of the MG42. Many soldiers interviewed after the battle were quoted to say that the rate of fire was so high it was impossible to discern acoustically the individual shells firing. Many cited that the machine guns sounded like the tearing of canvas.<br/><br/>On 12 March, the LSSAH made progress into the center of the city of Kharkov, breaking through hardened enemy defenses in the northern suburbs. What followed was a house-to-house bloodbath as the Germans pressed ever closer to city center. By the end of the day, the division had reached a position just two blocks north of Dzerzhinsky Square. The 2nd Panzergrenadier Regiment's 2nd Battalion was able to surround the square, after taking heavy casualties from Soviet snipers and other defenders, by evening. When taken, the square was renamed Platz der Leibstandarte. That night, 2nd Panzergrenadier Regiment's 3rd Battalion, under the command of Joachim Peiper, linked up with the 2nd Battalion in Dzerzhinsky Square and attacked southwards, crossing the Kharkov River and creating a bridgehead, opening the road to Moscow Avenue. Meanwhile, the division's left wing reached the junction of the Volchansk and Chuhuiv exit roads and went on the defensive, fighting off a number of enemy counter-attacks.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of the debacle at Stalingrad it almost defies belief that German soldiers, in this some of the last elite units available on the Eastern Front ... would plunge into the heart of a massive urban center and initiate house-to-house combat. But that's exactly what took place in Kharkov during the winter of 1943 and the results were a victory ... of sorts. The decline of German fortunes in the East were halted and the desire of Hitler to launch another offensive, to eliminate the Kursk Salient, was whetted. The battle also pointed some historians toward an answer to the 'what if' ... as in what if Hitler had assigned Waffen SS units to attack Stalingrad.<br/><br/>KHARKOV: BATTLE FOR THE SQUARE places you in the heart of an urban battlefield with nothing to fight with but elite units on both sides. The counter collection is impressive: ALL THE COMBAT COUNTERS NEEDED TO PLAY ALL OF THE SCENARIOS ... in ALL NEW presentations ... Germans AND Russians in Winter 1943 uniforms. And all AFV counters are 'winterized' ... aka 'whitewashed' ... to be more evocative than ever.

Two shock groups were formed, with one consisting primarily of the 100th J&auml;ger Division, whose task was to clear and control Mamaev Kurgan, followed by an advance into the Tennis Racket and the Bannyi Ravine and finally to occupy the Krasnyi Oktiabr workers' settlements. Paulus' counterpart, General Chuikov was well aware of these preparations and had planned appropriate spoiling attacks, though he was unaware of the fresh German reinforcements. His attack was disrupted before it could even begin, with waves of Stukas strafing his advancing forces. His strongpoint on the crest of the burial mound was destroyed. Bombs and artillery cut down the attackers, decimating their ranks and allowing the following German advance to gain ground. The j&auml;gers advanced two regiments abreast and captured the western slopes, but initially failed to take the southern slopes. The 227th J&auml;ger Regiment's vigorous assaults, supported by intense artillery, destroyed the Russian ability to hold on. The Germans would secure the summit that evening (though some bypassed remnants would harass the Germans on the southern and western slopes for the next few days). By day's end, the 95th Division retained a foothold on the northern and eastern slopes of the burial mound, but was down to only 400 effective fighting men.<br/><br/>The Battle of Stalingrad has received no shortage of treatment in the wargame realm. No tactical-level game has ever treated the titanic and unique battle for Stalingrad's Mamayev Hill, aka Mamayev Kurgan ... until NOW. From the first thrusts of Hitler's Wehrmacht on 13 September to the last days of 1942 the hill changed hands time and again. By 27 September the Germans had again captured half of Mamayev Kurgan. The Soviets held their own positions on the slopes of the hill, as the 284th Rifle Division desperately defended key strongholds. The defenders held out until 26 January 1943, when the Soviet winter offensive known as Operation Uranus, relieved them, in the process trapping and destroying the German VI Armee in the tomb of Stalingrad.<br/><br/>When the battle ended, the blood-soaked hill known as Mamayev Kurgan was plowed up and under ... and mixed with blood and fragments of shrapnel (between 500 and 1,250 steel splinters were later counted per square meter). The earth on the hill had remained black in the winter, as the snow kept melting in the many fires and explosions. During the spring of 1943 the soil of Mamayev Kurgan remained black. No grass would sprout in its scorched and blood-soaked soil.<br/><br/>It's time to come out of the factories ... at least until CH's ATS Krasny Oktyabr hits the streets ... and have a unique Stalingrad-themed experience as you fight to hold, capture, or re-capture Mamayev Kurgan.

Cinderella grew up to become a dictatorial, sadistic queen and Little Red Riding Hood is a cursed teenage vampire who travels the lands under a blood soaked cloak suggestively luring in her next victim. Hansel and Gretel are now the cannibalistic servants of the house made of sweets, since the witch is no more.  These are not your grandma's fairytales&hellip; but your great-grandmother is familiar with The Brothers Grimm.<br/><br/>The descriptions above are mere examples of what the Grimm Lands may hold instore for you. They are based on familiar fairy tales, folk lore, myth, nursery ryhmes, or anything else that may have captivated you as a child. As we grow older we see how violent and awful the events in these stories are. We recognize the immoral acts and we notice the triviality of the human experience.  The characters are sometimes forced to deal with awful entities to preserve their own lives. Make sure the players discuss and decide what sort of Grimm experience they would like before delving in. For some, it may be an opportunity to consider the implications of these deeper topics. For others, it may simply be a fun chance to pretend to be the bully they hated, the popular kid they envied, or to relive being the nerd or dreamer. Grimm could stretch into an extended campaign wherein the kids take over the Grimm Lands. Alternatively, the game could be short-lived where the characters are snuffed out one by one. Somewhere in between a Grimm campaign may take characters from 1st to 6th level culminating in a &ldquo;skin of their teeth&rdquo; escape to the real world. Regardless of your style; this game is all about fantastic imagination.<br/><br/>Take on the persona of a child who has slipped from reality into a nightmare of grotesque fantasy.

Most adult board games today are very shallow and have no depth to them.  married couples have often purchased &quot;sex games&quot; that come and go and offer no substance.  Lover'sopoly touches on every level of marriage relationship from intimacy, to sex, to romance and even humor.<br/><br/>The players are by rolling the dice and advancing to the next space.  Spaces consist of &quot;action spaces&quot; as well as &quot;Pandora's Box&quot; and &quot;Naughty or Nice&quot;.  When landing on an action space the individual has the right to purchase the space and build on the space &quot;time chips&quot;.  By purchasing more time chips they receive more time with the action when their spouse lands on it.  &quot;Padora's Box&quot; and &quot;Naughty or Nice&quot; are not properties open to ownership but rather actions or questions that are fueled throughout the game and keep the game interesting and moving along.  The goal is to own as many of the desired action properties but watch out because your partner may earn the right to purchase an action property right from under your nose.<br/><br/>The action properties are the most creative portion of the game.  Ladies, how would you like to receive a nice 3 minute kneck massage every time your partner lands on your space?  <br/>Or perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind your partner drawing a seductive pose of you in your birthday suite?  Men, how would you like your spouse enjoying a nice dessert off of your mid-section?  Or perhaps having your wife describe your most attractive features?<br/><br/>This game has everything for both male and female and is the perfect way to spark up a relationship.

The memories of his past life are erased, and he is given the choice to join 'Inferno' or die. After joining the organization he is given the name 'Zwei' and will study under 'Ein'. Ein is also known as 'Phantom', the title given to the organization's top assassin.<br/><br/>Inferno is said to be the 'United Nations of crime syndicates'. As Zwei makes his way through training and various missions, deceit and betrayal occur even within Inferno and slowly put Zwei in increasing danger. Along the way, Zwei meets a girl by the name of Cal Devens and, though he tries to protect her, she too is drawn into Inferno to become the assassin, 'Drei'.<br/><br/>The game is divided into three chapters. The first chapter deals with Zwei being turned into a killer and has two main &quot;routes&quot; to follow, the Ein route and the Claudia route. No matter which route is chosen, the chapter ends with Scythe escaping and Ein presumably dead, unless one opts to escape back to Japan. The second chapter starts off one year after the events in the first chapter, and deals with Claudia's plan to bring the Godoh group into the organization, Scythe's revenge, and the introduction of a new character, Cal Devens. It contains the Cal route and the final Claudia route.<br/><br/>In 2010, Nitroplus announced the game will be remade for the Xbox 360 featuring the same scenario but based on the designs created for the anime series from Bee Train.

This success encouraged the authors to sell the program directly to customers. Through an ad in Byte Magazine they sold (for $15) photocopied listings of the assembly language program that would work on most any Z80-based microcomputer. Availability of the source code allowed porting to other machines.<br/><br/>A Navy Petty Officer, Paul Lohnes, ported Sargon to the TRS-80, altering both graphics, input, and housekeeping routines leaving the Spracklen's chess-playing algorithm intact. The TRS-80 version became an instant success with the help of Hayden Book's newly established software division: Hayden Software.<br/><br/>Hayden also released Sargon for the Apple II.

Six pre-generated characters are included as well as blank cards for  people to create their own. Each Hunter character is rated 1 to 5 on six different attributes. Event cards and player actions will test the skills of each Hunter character.<br/><br/>On their turn, players execute two actions from among nine different choices. The players are attempting to find a good hunting area while increasing their rating on the Deer Encounter Meter, which is a measure of progress toward finding where the deer are located. Eventually, players will execute Hunt actions in the hopes of seeing deer. Once a player determines that deer are present, the deer need to be identified and brought in close enough for a shot. As the deer move closer and the encounter continues, the alertness level of the deer will generally begin to increase as they sense danger nearby. If the players aren't careful, the deer may flee and ruin their chances for a shot.<br/><br/>Players have to manage their Energy levels, items, Hunter cards and save up for bonuses while staying aware of what the other players are doing and attempt to blunt their efforts where possible.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"206574": "First Edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Whitetail Wilderness", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "average": "6.3125", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"7576": "Animals: Deer"}}, "141276": {"boardgamedesigner": {"16722": {"name": "Ariel Seoane"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Invasions Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"16722": "Ariel Seoane"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"206593": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "In Invasions Tuatha D&eacute; Danann, players will storm the ancient island of Ireland as the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann, seeking to conquer and claim the land from the Fir Bolg inhabitants.

Sunspots are represented by pips on dice faces.

If both players have different number of sunspots in the two fields on a given sector, the player with the higher (in a 'max' sector) or lower (in a 'min' sector) number wins the sector, which changes the turn order so that it's now this player's turn again.

Each turn players will draw a card from the top of a deck, discard a card face up onto a deck, and move a card from one deck to another (you may do these actions in any order, but you must do them all). If you successfully have all the cards necessary to Do Your Job at any point on your turn, you win!<br/><br/>Jobs are not so easily done, though. The corporate world is a cruel mistress, and the player must try to figure out the other players' jobs in order to thwart jobs being done. If people realize what job you are trying to do, desired cards can be buried within one of the decks during other players' discard or move action since you can only draw from the top of a pile.<br/><br/>In the Treachery game variant, each player tries to win the most points. They will accomplish this by first betting for the round. Then players will play a job card (either the Pirate or the Dwarf) and a number card face down. The pirates will then flip their bet (positive to negative or negative to positive) and switch number cards with the other players according to the arrows. Whoever has the highest number will win all the bets and play will repeat in this fashion. Be wary though, for if each person plays the Pirate, the bets will be flipped, but everyone keeps their number card.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"206634": "First Edition"}, "age": "5", "name": "Do Your Job", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "average": "3", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "141300": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1739520.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"68044": {"name": "Eric Ebbs"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"68045": "Toles Media"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"24973": {"name": "Mythical Eras of War, Games, LLC."}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1739520_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "Era of the Ninja is a game of stealth and combat in which players take on the role of ninja attempting to eliminate the lord of a castle in feudal Japan.
