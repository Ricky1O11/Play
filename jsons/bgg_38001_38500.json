Castling remains the same as in normal chess, and pieces may capture as the do normally, including laterally or backwards.<br/><br/>This small change in the results results in a game that last only a finite number of turns, and with one side guaranteed a win.

Phil had released versions prior to partnering with Downey Games that were &quot;highlight based&quot; games. The Downey Games release of La Grande Boucle is a departure from previous designs. Rather than continuing the &quot;highlight based&quot; game engine, Phil has developed a full-blown simulation of the Tour de France.<br/><br/>Phil recently commented, &quot; Although sharing the same name as previous versions, the latest incarnation is a completely different concept. No highlights here as the game system covers the action on the full length of each stage. Every single aspect of Road Racing is covered. There are also options for tactical choices.&quot;<br/><br/>La Grande Boucle is the ONLY full simulation of the Tour de France. Every stage, time trial, and rider is included in the game.<br/><br/>In game terms, the Tour de France is quite challenging a subject because of, the huge quantity of riders taking part (around 200) and the difference in the character of the 20 + stages which form the race. However, Phil has risen to the challenge. La Grande Boucle not only gives accurate results, but you'll feel as if you are taking part in the actual Tour de France.<br/><br/>We do want to reiterate that this is not simply a relabeling of an old game. La Grande Boucle version 4 is a completely new design.<br/><br/>Phil asked me to close with the following: &quot;The game is meant to be played over several sessions. This is definitely not a fast or quick replay game. The flat stages are fairly quick to replay and will be slotted in one seating. Mountain stages, however, will take much longer to complete.<br/><br/>Not wishing to discourage you, but finishing this replay will be like finishing the Tour: Difficult but Rewarding.

Enjoy new game play features and a moving Hogwarts game board. Dark magic has been performed at Hogwarts. A fellow student has vanished from the famous School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--and it is up to you to solve the mysterious disappearance.<br/>Play as Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna or Neville and try to discover who did it, what spell or item they used, and where the student was attacked. Was it Draco Malfoy with a Sleeping Draught in the Owlery?<br/>Move around Hogwarts making suggestions--but watch out. Wheels on the board actually move to reveal secret passages, hidden staircases, and even the Dark Mark. Think you've gathered all the facts you need? Go to Dumbledore's office to make your final accusation to win the game.<br/><br/>This version of the classic Clue game combines the standard clue idea of going from room to room making suggestions of who, what, and where. However, this version adds a few new ideas.  The first is the ever changing board.  On a players turn s/he roles three dice, two regular and a special die.  The special die has the four houses of Hogwarts on it.  This allows a player to change the layout of the board, by opening/closing doors, changing the secret passage way, reveling the dark mark (causing lose of house points), or getting help cards.<br/><br/>The house points are a second change.  In this version either a player can win, or all players can lose and the dark side wins, by getting all the players house points.  House points are lost when the dark mark appears and a card is reveled from the dark deck.  The players affected must either show a help card that protects them from the dark deck card, or lose the set number of house points.  Dropping to zero house points causes a player to lose and out of the game.<br/><br/>The other two card types are the third change in the game.  There are help cards that consist of items, allies, and spells.  These are used to combat the second deck, the Dark Deck.  The dark deck cards are revealed when a dark mark appears either on the dice roll, or by moving the house wheels changing the door layouts.  The dark mark card affect players in specific locations and those players must be able to show the indicated help cards or lose house points.<br/><br/>All-in-all the idea is the same as traditional clue, but the extra things makes the game just different enough.

Something has gone horribly wrong and zombie German Army humanoids, known as Kroids, are attacking with organized military efficiency.<br/><br/>- Who is leading the Kroids?<br/>At this time we have no idea who, or what, is controlling or leading these Kroid forces.

Instead, these zombies appear to independently think and communicate. As they attack and kill our troops their ranks grow in numbers. What we do know is that a dead soldier, in any condition, burned, missing limbs or shot all to hell will, if not 'finished,' rise as a Kroid within 24 hours. A 'finished' corpse is one that has had its head removed.<br/><br/>- Why are the Kroids here and what do they want?<br/>Sadly we have no idea. We believe this is the result of same wacky Nazi secret weapon experiment gone horribly wrong and we will just have to deal with it as best as we can. We do know that a Nazi machine called the Cyclomatron was built and activated by a team of SS scientists and engineers working at Castle Wewelsburg in Germany. Somehow this machine is the power behind these Kroids.<br/><br/>- How do we defeat the Kroids?<br/>To date our strategy has been one of attacking the Third Reich's ability to wage war. We have been very successful in dismantling their infrastructure by destroying factories, refineries and transport. We have denied them the ability to manufacture and deploy the tools of war. The Kroids have no supply lines and they pick their tools of war up off the ground. They do not need to eat; they do not need to sleep. Their machines do not run on gas and ball bearings. Simply put, we have to change our entire strategy. As commanders you must think with your head. A casualty in your command is a new recruit for the Kroid army. The orders you have already received detail our current strategy, which is one of containment.

Action is fast and furious and not all sleds may make it to the finish. Huskies only have one setting and that is full speed! Hang on to your furs, the reins, your sled and anything else you can get hold of.<br/><br/>The game contains modular track pieces which can be fitted together to form different courses. Players have their own Dog Decks which they draw from and play onto their sled mat. Movement is rarely in a straight line as the sled may drift left or right. Losing control or speeding into a corner results in Dent cards being acquired which will limit a player's hand size.<br/><br/>The game features a fun and original movement mechanism.<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary <br/>Race courses are built randomly. Players each have a dog sled with 2 dogs (initially valued 3 each) and a brake (also 3). Each player has the same deck of cards (5 sets of cards 1-5, shuffled) from which they draw a hand of 5 cards.<br/><br/>On your turn, may play 1-3 cards of the same value to these 3 locations (dog1, dog2, brakes). Forward speed (and distance moved) = dog1 + dog2 - brake + bonus (=position in race) if (dog1 = dog2). Lateral movement distance = dog1 - dog2 (move to the side with the stronger dog). Certain parts of the track have speed limits; you take damage if you exceed them, or if you run into obstacles (ice patches, side of track, etc.). Damage = cards that take up space in your hand (so 5th damage --&gt; out of the race!).<br/><br/>The first player to cross the finish line wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"269389": "English third edition"}, "average": "6.99586", "name": "Snow Tails", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "4938", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "38056": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Oregon Trivia Game", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1679882_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2132": {"name": "Michael Glenn Productions"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1679882.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1027": {"name": "Trivia"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Be the first player to get to the level 5 center of the board to win.

Timing a swing of the pendulum, the other player attempts to knock the ball off the rail and into one of the scoring areas marked 100, 200, 500.

The lure of trading large sums of cash with the possibility of striking it rich ran deep in the collective unconscious across the globe.<br/><br/>The box includes 835 shares of stock in each of nine different corporations with the following denominations/counts: 1/10, 5/5, 10/5, 50/5, 100/5. This is at odds with the instructions which call for 435 shares. It also includes approximately $110,000 in paper money in the following denominations: $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $1,000 and $5,000. Again this is at odds with the instructions which call for $147,600. Included is one pair of standard dice, a dice cup, 9 wooden Price markers, and one large board marking the rising stock prices.<br/><br/>The Big Board  &ldquo;represents the quotation board as used in a broker&rsquo;s office&rdquo;, and attempts to &ldquo;represent in a realistic manner the fluctuation of stocks, as on the New York Stock Exchange.&rdquo; Nine stocks are available for trading. Each player starts with $5,000.00. One player is selected as the supervisor of the treasury and stock certificates. The instructions suggest that this player throws the dice and moves the price quotation markers, but is &ldquo;not the banker and does not participate in the profits or losses of the BIG BOARD.&rdquo;, effectively removing the player from the game. For those who don&rsquo;t wish to be left out of the game, an easy house rule could fix this by allowing one person to be banker and perhaps shifting the throw of the dice from player to player.<br/><br/>The game begins with the price markers on each of the stock spaces marked PAR. The market is now open and all players may purchase one or more shares of as many stocks as they wish. The dice are then rolled for the first stock, with the operator moving the marker upward the matching number of spaces rolled. If the marker lands on a value space, the price is set, if it lands on a &ldquo;Down To&rdquo; space, it is moved to the corresponding lower value and the price is set there. Players may now buy or sell values of this stock. These phases are continued for each stock, with the dice returning to the first stock when the others have been set. During intervals, transactions can occur at the current price of any stock.<br/><br/>The game can end in several ways: at a set time determined by all players at the start of the game (suggested by the game designers as a more realistic simulation of stock activity from day to day), or when 1 player has lost all money or the treasury is exhausted, or even when 1 player has made a &ldquo;certain amount of money over and above that which he started with&rdquo;.<br/><br/>"}, "38279": {"boardgamedesigner": {"11085": {"name": "P.

Missions are combined into Operations against specific targets, which can include other units in play, populations centers on the map, or political capital. Targets on the receiving end of such operations must execute specific casualty chains to account for losses caused by offensive operations.

Play by yourself or with up to eight players. Play your own boat by starting behind an imaginary line sailing to windward, tacking to avoid the head wind, rounding the mark, reaching to the second mark and on to the downwind leg of the course.

You can pick a team of bruisers with special skills like &quot;Body check&quot; and &quot;Thundering tackle&quot; or try to cheat your way to victory with &quot;Covert cynical tackle&quot; and &quot;Diver cheat&quot; or play the classy way with &quot;Playmaker&quot; and &quot;Attacking pace&quot; or blend them altogether.<br/><br/>It's a language-level2 game as play centres on the text on the cards, although once payers become familiar with their cards this text is seldom used.<br/><br/>The first release of cards is entitled &quot;Hell In The Pacific - The Unity&quot; and includes 81 unique footballer character cards from 40 countries.

Meloche.<br/><br/>The game map consists of 26 planets (one starting with each letter of the alphabet).<br/><br/>Players start with one planet, and a small force of ships.  They occupy/conquer planets, collect and trade resources, build ships, supply their planets and attempt to discover Battleship technology.<br/><br/>Players are eliminated when their home planet is conquered, and victory is achieved through the elimination of all other players.<br/><br/>The Future Art of War includes a creative movement mechanic which adds to the &quot;fog of war&quot; effect.  Ships travel from planet to planet via &quot;hyperspace&quot;, and a chart indicates the number of turns (1-6) required to travel between each pair of planets. When a ship departs for a planet, the controlling player secretly writes the first letter of the planet and the number of turns required on the bottom of the ship counter, and places it on the first space in the hyperspace track.  Each turn, all ships in the hyperspace track move one space further down the track, and, when a ship has reached the appropriate space, the controlling player reveals the ship's destination.  Therefore, while players know how many ships their opponents have in hyperspace, they do not know the ships' destinations, or when they will arrive.<br/><br/>The components of this game are quite good for a self-published game.  The map is poster-quality, and the cards, reference sheets, and money are comparable to many commercially published games.  The one component that clearly identifies the game as &quot;self-published&quot; is the ship counters, which are cut rectangles of flat plastic.  These, however, with a whiteboard marker, serve the &quot;hyperspace&quot; mechanic very well.

NOTE THAT YOU MUST OWN A COPY OF &quot;B-29 SUPERFORTRESS&quot; TO PLAY &quot;HELL OVER KOREA.&quot;<br/><br/>The time period covered in the Variant was chosen because it was the most dynamic period of the war for the B-29. Early missions (i.e., before November 1950) for the bomber met with little enemy opposition, with (relatively ineffective) raids against tactical targets.  North Korea&rsquo;s few strategic targets and industries were also quickly disposed of.  In November 1950, however, the Chinese Communists were in the war, and the B-29 began facing its first serious opposition with the introduction of large numbers of Soviet MiG-15 jet fighters.
