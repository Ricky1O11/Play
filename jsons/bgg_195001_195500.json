The goal of the game is for your female trucker to make a name for herself by being the first to gain 12 Fame Points and show the boys you can outhaul, outdrive, and outwit every other gearjammer on the road.  Put the hammer down as you pick up Commodities and deliver them to cities that demand them for Fame.  Earn Action cards for your accomplishments and use them to dominate the highway as you become a truck driving legend!  Just be sure to steer clear of old smokey...<br/><br/>On each turn, a player rolls the Movement Die and optionally the Speeding Die if they wish to attempt speeding.  Speeding can allow for an extra Movement point per turn, but can cause wasted fuel trying to avoid the cops if they catch you.<br/><br/>The player may then split their Movement between physically moving road spaces on the map, refueling, and picking up or dropping off loads in cities.  Each road space costs 10% fuel and players are towed to the connected city of another player's choice if they run out of fuel.<br/><br/>Contracts offer incentives to deliver certain types of goods or travel to specific regions for bonus Fame.  Action cards spice up the game by creating risky scenarios for extra Fame such as Bar Brawls and Street Chicken.  Or, play devious deeds against your opponents such as shooting out their gas tanks and stealing their loads.  Naturally, all cards are flavored with classic 1970s CB jargon.<br/><br/>"

If you're clever you can complete multiple schemes in a single turn, and close attention is rewarded if another artist creates the scheme you were after when it's not your turn.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may spend two of the five colors in your palette for their effects. Red allows you to match the colors your opponents have, yellow lets you mix your colors and theirs together, and blue lets you swap a color from your palette with one of another player's colors. Playing two primary colors gets you a secondary color, which simply combines the effects of the two primaries. Playing two secondary colors get you a black, which you must use on your next turn and costs you your secondary colors.<br/><br/>As you change the colors you possess and your opponent's, you will be able to complete your goals, all of which are based on actual color schemes such as split complimentary and analogous schemes. Accomplishing all five of your schemes first makes you the victor.<br/><br/>The game also includes cooperative rules for playing with younger children and rules for solo play.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Pok&eacute;mon Moon (ポケットモンスター　サン・ムーン Poketto Monsutā San &amp; Mūn?) are role-playing video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS. They are the first installments in the seventh generation of Pok&eacute;mon games. First announced in February 2016 through a special Nintendo Direct, both Sun and Moon were released worldwide in November 2016, commemorating the franchise's 20th anniversary.<br/><br/>As with previous installments, each game follows the journey of a young Pok&eacute;mon trainer (and the trainer's friends) as they train Pok&eacute;mon. This time, the game takes place in the Alola region&mdash;based on Hawaii&mdash;with the object of the game being to thwart the schemes of the nefarious criminal organization Team Skull, all while attempting to challenge various Pok&eacute;mon trainers of gradually increasing difficulty. Sun and Moon introduced 81 new Pok&eacute;mon species, and includes new features such as Alolan forms of previous generation Pok&eacute;mon, powerful moves known as Z-Moves, new, powerful creatures known as Ultra Beasts, updated battle and training mechanics, and improved polygonal 3D graphics. The games also adopted the previously introduced battle mechanic known as Mega Evolution, which was first introduced in Pok&eacute;mon X and Y. Although Sun and Moon are mostly independent of each other, both feature largely the same plot, and while either can be played separately, trading Pok&eacute;mon between the two games is allowed.<br/><br/>Upon release, the game received positive reviews from critics, and shipped over 10 million units worldwide within a week, becoming one of the fastest selling games in Nintendo's history. With 14.69 million copies sold worldwide by the end of December 2016, Sun and Moon are the third-best-selling Nintendo 3DS titles.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Pokémon Sun and Moon&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"

Roll the dice at the beginning of the round and select the appropriate forecast cards. The dice cause the market to rise or fall on any given turn and ensures that no two games will ever be the same.<br/><br/>Module 2: Bonds &mdash; Bond Cards present a new, safe investment option for players. Purchasing bonds can provide a steady stream of interest payments every round. However, it comes at a price. The original money used to purchase bonds cannot be recovered until the end of the game. Be careful not to overspend or you might lose out on valuable stockpiles.<br/><br/>Module 3: Commodities &amp; Taxes &mdash; Commodities &amp; Taxes create much more tension during the game. Each round, players add Commodity or Tax Cards face-up to the stockpiles. Collect different types of commodities and dodge taxes to earn substantial end-game bonuses.<br/><br/>Module 4: More Investors &mdash; Stockpile: Continuing Corruption adds six new investors from around the world who have heard about massive profits being made, and they want in on the action.

Primarily they are opposed by deity-level powers.  The action resolution mechanic uses dice pool and and colored tokens (colored candies are suggested).  Tokens can be expended to control (to some extent) the narrative outside of dice pools.  The game is somewhat structured, with enumerated actions available to characters (typically Create, Possess, Assault, though there are others).  Players may create play cards (using index cards) during play; they are used and potentially reused during the game.<br/><br/>"

You are the leader of one of several rival families aspiring to become emperor of the entire region. You start the game in a capital city, with just an aspiring emperor, a scout and a small army. The aim of the game is to become the dominant dynasty by conquering and maintaining control of capitals, temples and prefectures. Each of these actions will help you in gaining the victory points needed to be the undisputed emperor and win the game. To be successful you will need to manage your budding empire carefully. Manage your economy through taxation and expanding your population, secure stability by maintaining cohesion among the political elite, maintain a strong military through recruitment of units supported by powerful generals and avoid rebellion by gaining popularity with your subjects. You face an uncertain destiny and will encounter many challenges during your reign including plague, piracy and looting. However, you are not alone in your quest, as to help you gain the power you so richly deserve and to undermine your pitiful and unworthy enemies, you can call upon the ancient Chinese wisdom enshrined in the 36 stratagems.<br/><br/>"

There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.<br/><br/>Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.<br/><br/>"

But not all lichs are the same.<br/><br/>How old are they? What species are they? Why did they become a lich in the first place?<br/><br/>All these aspects and more are covered in this volume of the CDG. The CDG (Creature Description Generator) range is designed with a fantasy setting in mind, but can easily be used for sci-fi or modern/horror settings.<br/><br/>The aspects covered:<br/><br/>    Age - What is the apparent age of the Lich? At what age where they transformed into a member of the undead? <br/>    Condition - Lichs can range from being almost living, to virtual skeletons and this aspect gives you a few suggestions as to what that condition may be.<br/>    Death - When they became a lich, they had to die or have something similar to death applied to them. How did this occur<br/>    Lair - Where does the lich call home? Is it a grand castle or do they dwell in a cave behind a waterfall?<br/>    Personality - What sort of personality does the lich have? Are they, for a lich, kind or cruel and uncaring?<br/>    Phylactery - The phylactery is one of the hallmarks of a lich as it can house their soul or power source. What is the nature of this vessel?<br/>    Reason - Why did they become a lich in the first place? Was it through choice or was this state of undeath forced upon them from an angry god?<br/>    Servants &amp; Minions - Does the lich any servants to add it or minion to boss around and do its bidding?<br/>    Species - The majority of lichs seem to be human males for some reason, but other species have found the path to lichdom as well, sometimes through choice. What species does the lich belong to?<br/>    Quirks &amp; Features - Not all lichs are the same. Many have unique quirks and features that help stand out and be more memorable. Roll once on this table to find out what that can be. It might be something about the lichs phylactery, the fact they are female pretending to be male or something else entirely.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

That is, followers are essentially currency and power for those with the divine spark. Unfortunately for most deities, followers possess free will; nothing gets in the way more of the best-laid plans. Most times when a true believer strays, a simple atonement spell &mdash; typically coupled with a suitable quest &mdash; is enough to steer things back toward the deity&rsquo;s favor. Sometimes, though, the offense is so severe an atonement spell just isn&rsquo;t enough. Some offenses are so severe, so drastic, that forgiveness is nigh impossible. The only recourse in these circumstances is to dole out swift and severe punishment. Most of the time, deities are loath to interact directly with mortals. To handle these special circumstances, they have an unusual breed of hunters called the nel&rsquo;barzoth. Divine Hunters presents four new monsters, including a CR 22 mythic version, to hunt your infidels; it also presents the GM with rules for creating new versions.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "The labyrinth in the magic garden is constantly changing. By clever rotating the magical hedges, players open new paths to mysterious creatures and precious treasures. Magic cards help to fulfill the tasks. Who masters the turns and finds his way out of the magic garden first?<br/><br/>A new twist at the changing labyrinth. This time, the paths are bordered by hedges, which can be rotated to change the paths.<br/><br/>Each player has a stack of cards that direct him to various places in the labyrinth. In his turn, the player moves his pawn along the path; he may also rotate one hedge before, during or after his move. If he reaches his current target, he turns his next target card face up. Otherwise, he gets a magic card as consolation.<br/><br/>The magic cards can be used during a players turn to aid movement. A hole allows to slip through a hedge. Two fairies allow to fly from one fairy spot to another one, ignoring the terrain in between. A player may use any number of magic cards in his turn.<br/><br/>After a player has visited the targets on his six cards, the other players decide which exit he needs to reach to win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>This game, submitted in several posts to an online competition forum, is a fusion of a particular setting with a fairly lightweight rules system.  The setting is a typical fantasy world, but one in which good has lost and evil triumphed.  But the evil has subsequently become listless and without energy, yielding an overwhelmingly negative but banal existence.  The characters - members of The Brotherhood adventure within this setting.  Characters have basic attributes and several spell-like powers.  Action resolution uses a d6 minus a d6, yielding a -5 to +5 spread that compares to a target difficulty.  The dice must be of identified colors.<br/><br/>The game is ambitious and includes a brief bestiary and some advice for game masters.  However, the rules are fairly subtle and probably would require an experience game master.<br/><br/>"

The one downside of living there was the constant infighting of the clans. They not only disagreed about the way the empire was built, but the way they traded with their neighbors, too.<br/><br/>The clans didn't agree on much, but the Emperor decreed that there was to be no open fighting amongst them. This &quot;peace&quot; lasted for many years. Then came the storm of all storms. Sweeping many clans away, the Emperor was lost for solutions &mdash; but then in the Osae Valley, a mist had appeared, and those who entered it were transported to a new land. The Emperor decreed that all clans should venture forth and settle their new empire.<br/><br/>As they did, the oversight was little to none...which lead to the clans competing for the favor of the Emperor by any means necessary. Now the clans of Amallian race to win the favor of the Emperor by building her Empire, trading goods, and showing the most strength on the other side!<br/><br/>In Legends of the Mist, you take on the role of a legend from one of the four clans. By rolling dice from your pool, you can work to build the Emperor's new kingdom with new plots, fight to control them, produce goods from them, and gain wealth for your clan and the kingdom. Each die type has a different frequency of letting you perform these actions. The other clans will work to undermine you every now and again and since dice are assigned in secret, your planning and foresight are important.<br/><br/>Should you complete the objectives that the Empress gave you better than anyone else, you will be rewarded as the winner of her favor!<br/><br/>"

All-that-is is shaped like the inside of an egg, its inhabitants can see the ground curve up and away from them. The year in All-that-is is defined by the procession of the sun - every 320 days it traces out a circle in a plane through the fattest part of the egg - and in its procession it brings seasons to the lands of the bulge, colder as the sun moves away, warmer as it returns.

The game suggests ten or more encounters for a traditional game.  Characters are all samurai that have three Facets (Attributes): Awar, Kenjutsu, and Tanka.  Each Facet has a numeric value, distributed from a point pool.  This represents the dice pool associated with that Facet.  Opposed actions utilize opposed dice pool rolls where successes are counted and compared.<br/><br/>The game has an interesting structure of basic rules augmented by several optional rules, allowing groups to utilize as much or as little rules complexity as desired.  The game was published in a series of forum posts, but a final &quot;gathered&quot; post puts all the pieces together with some clarifications and better flow.  Additionally, the game subsequently was published in formatted HTML on the author's personal site (no longer extant).<br/><br/>"

The towering, grotesque figure was shunned by all who see him.<br/><br/>Upon creating his monster, Frankenstein fled from it in horror and disavowed it. The monster was forced to wander the wilderness and eke out a meagre existence.

Movement is determined by a die. All players move clockwise around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns. Whenever a pawn arrives on a space as the result of a die-roll, it advances by the number of spaces shown on that space. If a pawn arrives on a red space, it advances into an inner ring. The pawns have to circle the innermost ring, till they manage to enter their &quot;Ziel&quot; section. Captured pawns are returned to their player's &quot;Start&quot; section. The winner is the first player to move all pawns into the &quot;Ziel&quot; section.<br/>This game was published about 1930.<br/><br/>"

(Maybe.)<br/><br/>You as the player take on the role of a campaign manager backing a candidate(past, present or fictional). Each turn you have a choice, go for votes or play a Wonk card. Wonk cards will either up your candidate's Independant, Republican and/or Democrat appeal, or damage your opponents.<br/><br/>The player with the most voter points at the end of the round wins the state. Each state card has electoral college votes, to win a short game you need to be the first player to reach 70 electoral college votes with at least 4 state cards, or go for the long haul you need to be the first to 270 electoral college votes. <br/>So, will you play fair and hope winning over the voters will get  your candidate into the White House or sling mud like the best of them and go down fighting?<br/><br/>",

To win the game, you must play cards and invest knowledge crystals. If you played well, you will then be able to level up at the beginning of your turn and acquire more power. Depending on the cards that you play, you will be able to use crystals of your opponents. If you reach mage level 5 or if you have eliminated all other players, you win.<br/><br/>WizArt is an exciting strategy card game with a lot of player interaction which is easy to learn but hard to master. It takes about 30 minutes to play and is suitable for players who are 8 years or older.<br/><br/>",

The game does use a credible mechanism for assembling the adventuring party from disparate individuals who may be antipathetic to each other.<br/><br/>"

The Jedi battle the Sith lords, playing out the age-old struggle between the light and dark sides of the Force. The armies and navies of the Rebels and the Empire clash on planets and in the skies above them. The galaxy&rsquo;s smugglers and spies struggle for supremacy against the scum that lurk in the shadows. These dynamic rivalries have shaped the Galactic Civil War, and now, with the the Opposition cycle, they will take their rightful place in Star Wars: The Card Game as well.<br/><br/>Ancient Rivals kicks off the Opposition cycle and simultaneously serves as an introduction to the new themes and mechanics that will be found therein. Here, you will find a host of cards that focus on the struggles between pairs of affiliations: Jedi and Sith, Rebel Alliance and Imperial Navy, Smugglers and Spies and Scum and Villainy. The Opposition cycle also introduces a host of new fate cards, including a new type&mdash;fate cards with an affiliation. Ancient Rivals also offers up a host of iconic characters: the heroes and villains of Star Wars: Rebels begin to appear in the LCG, joined by new versions of classic characters like Dengar, Han Solo, and Darth Vader.

As the heroes explore, they must use their abilities, buy items, and recruit allies to help them defeat the monsters before facing the powerful Catacomb Lord, thereby saving the town.<br/><br/>In more detail, in Catacombs players flick wooden discs that represent the monsters and heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, while missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb.<br/><br/>Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game. Conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated.<br/><br/>This third edition of Catacombs has all-new artwork compared to the earlier editions, but more importantly the keywords from the first two editions has been replace with iconography, the terminology has changed, and the third edition has new shot types, new card effects, and a different set of components (many of which have changed statistics) as well as wall pieces not present in earlier editions.<br/><br/>",

No waiting. Just lies and murder!<br/><br/>DETHRONED, the whole game is a set that comes with 2 decks:<br/>-Traitors and Kings &amp; Guards and Thieves-<br/><br/>Each with their own theme, unique art, and lore. They can be played completely independently up to 4, OR together for up to 8 player chaos and fun!<br/><br/>Players first begin by going around the table claiming a role. Depending on the role you secretly got will help determine if you should lie about your role, though you never have to. After that, players continue discussing until 2 players vote to begin combat.<br/><br/>Once combat begins, players may attack each other at any point in time, until someone dies. Every time someone dies, combat is paused and a vote to end the game goes up. All living players must unanimously vote to end and to not vote yes, you have to attack another player, if you cannot then you're forced to vote yes to end. The game can only end in a stalemate (players reveal hands to prove such) OR after a player has died.<br/><br/>Once the game ends, roles are revealed and winners are determined based on the role's win conditions.<br/><br/>"

Can you infect the world?<br/><br/>Each player is a deadly disease and they must battle against each other to spread their plagues, develop new symptoms and ultimately wipe out humanity.<br/><br/>Starting with Patient Zero, you spread your infection across the world by placing tokens in cities - earning DNA points and preventing other players from becoming dominant. Players choose which countries are placed on the board but you must be both climate resistant and connected to a country before you can infect it. Eventually, as countries become fully infected - you try to kill them using the Death Dice.<br/><br/>Each player&rsquo;s unique pathogen can be upgraded by evolving trait cards onto an evolution slide (with DNA points). At the start, your disease is weak and unspecialised, so you will need to add new symptoms to make it stronger. Choose carefully and plan ahead in order to react to the changing world and exploit opportunities created by other player&rsquo;s actions.<br/><br/>A simple nosebleed could accelerate things early on, whilst diarrhea will help you thrive in hot countries. Sneezing can infect new continents by air but Total Organ Failure would allow you wipe out multiple countries each turn.<br/><br/>As countries start to fall, use powerful event cards to alter the balance of power. You might try to eradicate a dominant player by bombing their diseased cities, or hold the Olympics to cause huge numbers of infected people to travel to a healthy continent.<br/><br/>When the world collapses, who will be the ultimate plague?<br/><br/><br/>*5 players with 5th player expansion<br/><br/>",

Characters have a complex variety of Attributes, placed into Attribute Groups.  Characters also have Skills that can be improved through play.  The game suggests characters select a type (roughly like a class in concept) to help define which Skills should be selected together, but this is not enforced by the rules.  Skills are placed into Skill Groups though these primarily are organizational and not restrictive.  Characters may also have a variety of feats, talents, and flaws (Traits) - including some which confer magical abilities.<br/><br/>The remainder of the volume includes the game mechanics, which are based on percentile rolls.  The game is quite detailed with numerous rules for various special circumstances.  There is a heavy focus on combat and the clear intent is to involve the characters in frequent person-to-person combat, highly favored over other styles of combat available in science fiction settings.  Equipment lists, for example, include things like daggers and bows.<br/><br/>"

Please just leave us alone.&rdquo;&mdash;Paul<br/><br/>Under the Overpass is an exterior map of two support walls and nine columns for a highway above, a railway in the east, and an area in the west with three couches and a bed that are used by the homeless to sleep with the highway above sheltering them from the rain.<br/><br/>Under the Overpass is intended for use in modern or post-apocalyptic games (the scattered debris on the map gives it a ruined feel). It could even be a down on their luck superhero&rsquo;s hideout.<br/><br/>Adventure hook for use with this map:<br/><br/>The People under the Overpass: A local gang has lost a drug shipment. Supposedly it was lost on a rail route. The gangers traced the drug shipment&rsquo;s path by backtracking along the railway. They found a small community of homeless people next to the railway under the overpass. They questioned them, but they didn&rsquo;t have any answers. The gang members didn&rsquo;t like that and proceeded to beat on the spokesman of the homeless, Paul.<br/><br/>John, a member of the homeless community has an uncanny knack for knowing when the trains were coming. Almost like an internal clock. When Paul was attacked he threw himself at the gang members and tossed them on the railway into the way of an oncoming train. The result was two dead gang members and a call from the train operator to the police about the accident.<br/><br/>The player characters arrive on the scene as local law enforcement such as police or detectives. They are here to question the homeless. However, when he sees the cops, Paul runs for it. The gangers are angry about the death of their members and send a hit squad to kill the bums which arrive shortly after the cops chase after Paul or start their initial questioning of the homeless witnesses&hellip;<br/><br/>"

Traditionally, game play does not utilize a game master (though if the group prefers, one can be used).  The action is driven by cards and resolution can be settled by the use of a simple dice roll.  While any type of story can be told using the system, probably most will have some type of fairytale or fantastic qualities emerge.<br/><br/>One interesting aspect of the game allows for optional items to replace the pack of French playing cards as the narrative driver - noted options include dice, rune stones, Legos, &quot;boogers&quot;, or even rocks.<br/><br/>"

Each mission is often introduced by briefing with the player given information about what to expect, or what to destroy. Each operation area has a boss at the end that the player has to overcome.<br/><br/>During the course of the game, the player can find power-ups, ranging from ammo for the main guns, ammo for secondary weapons, or energy for the Sioux/T1's shields, and even pick up an extra gun for both vehicles' main weapons. Weapons range from a fast hitting &quot;Razor&quot; gun, a laser cannon, missiles, smart bombs, and more. Enemies ranged from helicopters, tanks, rocket buggies, flying robots, and stationary guns. Environments that the player deals with include wide open valleys, a volcanic island, a massive underground base, and the ice fields of Greenland complete with an alien city. The player often operates from the cockpit of the vehicle they are in, but can look around or even switch to 3rd person view.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Assault Extreme Assault]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>As I was putting together these games I realized that in different ways each one deals with memory. Fall Lineup grew out of nostalgia. When we were kids we loved gimmicky shows like Automan and Small Wonder. Previews for Manimal captured our imaginations; my best friend was so terrified by them that he couldn&rsquo;t go into a dark room for a month. A year or two ago we were talking about some of the shows and I realized that even though I could easily find clips online that seeing them again might ruin my memories of them.<br/><br/>The House of Unusual Size explores lost memories. Inspired by Gaston Bachelard&rsquo;s The Poetics of Space, a version of the game originally appeared as part of the 2013 National Game Design Month 24-Hour RPG competition. Johanna Haas provided editorial and moral support when this came together during Thanksgiving, and the folks at Gaia House in Carbondale, Illinois, gave invaluable advice. Silas Marques de Lima deserves special praise for introducing the game to group therapy sessions for teens in S&atilde;o Paolo. His descriptions of their experiences inspired me to revisit the game.<br/><br/>Pen in Hand deals with a form of personal and social memory that evolved into a source for historians. I used to work as the director of a nineteenth-century house museum, and while doing research and reviews and I ran into repeated references to the autograph books kept by young women. The ways in which people used the books&mdash;and particularly the ways girls and young women used secret books to mark levels of connection&mdash;has fascinated me ever since.<br/><br/>"

The object of the game is to collect the most money in cash, horse value and bonuses. Bonuses are awarded for collecting certain groups of horses. They add another level of strategy to the game. Game play is very easy and intuitive for horse people but no horse knowledge is needed to play.<br/><br/>Everyone begins the game with money and horses to start the fun right away. There are several suggested winning scenarios for you to choose from for one hour of play to days of fun. All the turns are cooperative but competitive to keep things lively!<br/><br/>Collect and show horse cards featuring fabulous pictures of real horses in 8 equestrian sports (Dressage, Driving, Trail, Western Pleasure, Western Performance, Racing, Cross Country and Hunter Jumper).<br/><br/>Add horses to your stable at public auctions where everyone can bid. Bid as high as you dare &ndash; you know the range but the horse&rsquo;s actual value is kept a secret until the winning bid has been paid!<br/>Everyone can enter the shows and choosing the right horse will give you an advantage but anyone could steal the win if luck is on their side.<br/><br/>There are random and yearly horse expenses to watch out for so manage your salary and show winnings well. All the players get a real-life horse job (vet, farrier, trainer etc.) who are paid the expenses to keep those interactive too!<br/><br/>Horses are unpredictable so you never know what will be around the corner &ndash; wins or losses!<br/><br/>",

Who will defeat the most heroes and rein supreme... from jail when they get caught because... well... Superheroes are awesome like that.<br/><br/>Players get a hand of cards from which they will play or discard 2 per turn. For example minions, like Florence 'Hard Nut' McGee, could be placed on the field and players can start to create fiendishly clever weapons like the Poisonous Death Lamp. Alternatively they could play event cards such as the &quot;Publish a photo of your rival stroking a Kitten&quot; to reduce the fear gripping the city. Finally they could get bored and call up a Superhero to help the city... Then later use them for target practise. Superheroes start a set distance from the City and move closer after every round. If they reach the city they start to reduce the fear count which acts as the game timer.<br/><br/>Reducing fear and calling up Superheroes nets players kudos worth VP's at the end but defeating Superheroes earns you Capes which are worth more VP's and after all you are Mostly Evil.<br/><br/>"

When you play Ice, no matter your role in the game, your job is to entertain your fellows. Remember this. It will improve your gaming experience. In a game of Ice, one player is the referee and has a number of special duties. The other players are each primarily concerned with operating their character in the shared game world. Both the referee and the other players will sometimes: act &quot;in character&quot; when portraying the behavior of their characters, generate outcome statements during conflict resolution that will guide narration, describe scenes in which one or more player-character appear, provide input to any and all other players about each of these aspects of play or anything else -- typically in the form of &quot;it would be cool if this happened&quot; statements, and manage character resources primarily (but not solely) during conflict resolution. The referee's additional duties include: managing narration, adjudicating statement generation during conflict resolution, interpreting conflict outcomes, and awarding resources to the other players.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>Ice was partially developed under the working title Diamonds Are Forever; the title was change when the working title was used by another submission in the competition.<br/><br/>"

Societies flourished. Economies grew. The Kingdom of Aldur was born. But in a deep, dark cave under the Hog&rsquo;s Tooth Mountains, an explorer found a tome which contained the basic elements of magical manipulation. The Spell Codex, as it became known, was divided by a committee of wise men and women after much arguing over who bears responsibility of such a tool. Over time, pages became lost, others destroyed, and some squandered away in private collections. At best, we operate from copies of copies of copies.<br/><br/>Since the discovery of the Spell Codex, a strange thing has happened to the kingdom. Men and animals have become tainted with magic. New creatures have brought fear to our villages. Monsters have ravaged cities. We must fight this threat using any means necessary.<br/><br/>"

The divine nature of your oath holds your curse at bay, but you are still infused with the power of darkness. Having already experienced death, you are a lethal creature of the night.

Not only it introduces 18 brand new cars, but it TOTALLY reimplements the base game: new dashboards for the base game cars are included in the expansion, so you can play the base game using the new rules.<br/><br/>IMPROVEMENTS:<br/><br/>Now cars are balanced on the base of a yearly budget each player can use to buy the car, the driver (who gives bonus on racing) and spare parts.<br/><br/>Cars are more accurately designed and feature different and peculiar curve speeds so they do not ride the track in the same way and the difference between cars fast on straights and those faster on winding roads is much more significant and influences the fate of the race.<br/><br/>12 Single tracks and races have been included to play the game in one session, as well as the chance to race the entire Mille Miglia in one session of approximately 3 hours.<br/><br/>Using the single tracks, drivers can play the Italian Racing Championship and evolve their racing team year by year purchasing new cars and drivers.<br/><br/>No more calculations or writings, yet the same accuracy. Now the time track is kept with the use of a in-game clock.<br/><br/>Several others improvements to balance and make the game more fluid and enjoyable.<br/><br/><br/>",

It discusses the effects of scorching heat, unending sand, sunstroke and generally lethal conditions one is likely to encounter in the shifting dunes, salt flats and badlands of your world.<br/><br/>Now, instead of simply sending the party on an adventure to hunt down a villain, the GM can have their quarry flee across the desert. Instead of bandits along the road, the party now has to be on the lookout for desert nomads who will slaughter those who encroach on their territory. Instead of guarding a caravan along a trade road, they end up trudging across a vast plain of salt while a merciless sun beats down upon them.<br/><br/>Also incuded is a new character background, new equipment, new weapons and a new weapon feature related to this particular environ.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Davae Breon Jaxon's Cinematic Environs begins a new series of suppliments designed to help GMs paint vivid cinematic scenes for their players in a way that gives the environment its own unique character.<br/><br/>These environs can take a mundane encounter or location and turn it into an epic scene that the players will be talking about for year to come.<br/><br/>This first in the series deals with Arctic Environs. It discusses the effects of deep cold, despair, frostbite and generally miserable conditions one is likely to encounter in the frozen wastes, glacier fields and tundras of your world.<br/><br/>Now, instead of simply sending the party on an edventure to explore an ancient tomb, the GM can have the tomb buried beneath a glacier. Instead of a simple orc ambush, the party now has to be aware that too much noise could trigger an avalanche, and so the wizard must rethink using that thunder-based spell. Instead of simply chasing the bandits across an open field, they end up chasing them across a frozen lake that is cracking beneath their feet.<br/><br/>Also incuded is a new character background, new equipment and new weapons related to this particular environ.<br/><br/>"

It has been produced in 4500 copies and here's the rules for this character:<br/><br/>4 AP - This specialist has done his work years ago; he talked to the builders and home owners and convinced them to adopt a fire security plan. On his advice smoke detectors and smoke exhausts have been installed, and emergency exits have been planned and marked clearly. Now these measures prove their worth: People are warned and can move out via marked escape routes, and smoke clears off the building.<br/><br/>Prevent/De-Smoke: Move a smoke token anywhere on the board for 1 AP per space. Movement must be on the shortest route towards nearest exterior door, playerʼs choice if alternative routes exist; Smoke passes closed interior doors at no extra cost. Smoke vanishes when outside the building. Moved smoke ignites immediately if adjacent to fire; if it moves on top of other smoke, it becomes fire.<br/>Prevent/Escape: Move a POI token (only if &quot;?&quot; side up) anywhere on the board for 2 AP per space. Movement must be on the shortest route towards nearest exterior door, playerʼs choice if alternative routes exist. POIs can open doors on their way for 2 AP; they will not use breached walls, ladders etc. (they use the escape route &quot;as marked&quot;). POIs moved outside of the building (=coordinate area) are revealed. POIs will not move into fire.<br/><br/>Note: If playing with multi-floor game boards, &quot;shortest route to exterior door&quot; may be via a stair. Note: In the subway station, exits are all spaces with an ambulance symbol.<br/><br/>",

By using no pawns and predominantly the more powerful pieces from Maka Dai-Dai Shogi in a much more confronting starting position (only one rank separates the two players) Hishigata Shogi is a much faster and more dynamic game than Maka Dai-Dai Shogi while preserving the flavor of the old large board shogi variant.<br/><br/>The game was published at the chessvariants.com homepage in 2005.<br/>Se also description of Hishigata Shogi at Wikipedia as part of the Maka Dai-Dai Shogi article.<br/><br/>"

On one side are the Athenians and the Delian League, the Demos team; against them, the Oligarchs of Sparta and Corinth are teamed.<br/><br/>The Peloponnesian War is a great setting for a historical game, having two evenly matched factions with very differing capabilities. Athens (and the Delian League, including Corcyra) commanded the seas, and relied on trade to feed their masses. On land, the Spartan phalanx was virtually unbeatable, as all adult Spartan male citizens were professional soldiers<br/><br/>Players of Quartermaster General will find most of the concepts familiar. Since the game has a smaller maximum player count, the amount of activity during a turn has been slightly increased.For example, after the Play step there is a Planning step, when you can place a Prepare card on the table. Prepare cards in Victory or Death work a lot like Response Cards in Quartermaster General, but have a much broader scope of application. Many Prepare cards are used during the Strategy step, which is at the beginning of a player's turn. Much of the game play is structured around putting together effective combinations of played cards and prepared cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Red Poppies Campaigns (RPC) enables players to game WWI battles from the perspective of battalion and regimental command posts.  Players unleash opening bombardments and then maneuver infantry companies against machine gun fire to fight battles on historically accurate maps of actual battlefields.  The streamlined system for fire and movement enables a rapid ebb and flow with minimal dice rolling and lots of historical chrome.  Generally speaking, units can move or fire once per turn &ndash; machine gun fire is the notable, unpredictable exception &ndash; and can initiate melee after a move.  Fire resolution requires only one dice roll, made by the target and modified for the relevant circumstances such as incoming firepower, terrain, visibility, etc.  Throughout, players must effectively manage the dynamic tension between top down control and bottom up initiative to get their units onto the objective before their ever-eroding control crumbles to nil.<br/><br/>A tragic irony of WWI unifies all aspects of game play.  For most of the war, effective command and control of tactical units required a degree of concentration which threatened their survival.  In other words, the game illustrates the inverse relationship between a unit&rsquo;s responsiveness to orders and its durability.  So players must &ldquo;form&rdquo; infantry units to get them moving and then &ldquo;disperse&rdquo; them at the right moment to hold the ground gained.  Enemy fire can force premature dispersion which must be remedied to get an attack moving again.  For infantry, the formed condition represents troops arrayed for the convenience of top down command such as those deployed in skirmish line or a column-of-march while the dispersed condition represents troops spread out and hunkered down for their own survival.<br/><br/>The game illustrates the evolution of tactics during WWI.  In time, gas wafts across the battlefield, unit statistics change to show better performance while dispersed, a new method of tactical command and control (the &ldquo;blob&rdquo;) emerges, mortars pop up like mushrooms after the rain, and artillery becomes more responsive.  In addition to short, standalone scenarios, RPC has a &ldquo;campaign&rdquo; mechanism so players can link a series of interdependent scenarios to simulate battles that spanned days, and nights.  During these campaigns, the results of one scenario affect the start of another so conservation of force, supply lines, and replacements all become issues.  Players will get a sense of slogging forward in yards per day - at great cost &ndash; as they plot days of grinding combat.<br/><br/>Product Information<br/><br/>     Complexity:                 6 out of 10<br/>     Solitaire suitability:      8 out of 10<br/>     Time Scale:                 10 minutes per turn<br/>     Map Scale:                  200 yards per hex<br/>     Unit Scale:                 Companies, squadrons, sections<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

The Icarites had not yet descended upon the city and the Wastelanders were still deciding whether they wanted any part of it.<br/><br/>Since it has become clear that the two factions cannot share control, it is time for you to pick a side. Choose your faction, find your allies, banish those who oppose you, and ensure your place at the top of the dystopian society to follow. Now it's your change to Choose a Better Oppressor!<br/><br/>Leaders of Euphoria: Choose a Better Oppressor is a social deduction game in the style of Good Cop Bad Cop, but set in the world of Euphoria. It takes place earlier in the timeline than Euphoria, when the city was young and foolish. Players will have 3 cards in front of them that determine whether they are on the Euphorian or Subterran team that will be investigated throughout the game to figure out who's on their team and who's not.<br/><br/>Instead of the equipment cards from Good Cop Bad Cop, players now use and give artifacts from the Old World in a new Artifact Phase or as a standard action. In Leaders of Euphoria, you can use your turn to Hide one of your Recruit cards, which is important because, unlike Good Cop Bad Cop, you may not use important actions without having a hidden recruit to expose. Also, there is no player elimination like there was in GCBC, as players who are banished from the city become Wastelanders and have a new victory condition.<br/><br/>",

Each card depicts a historical event on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>Timeline: History of Russia can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.<br/><br/>Card represent event related to the culture of Russia.

They're not overjoyed to find their home besieged by humans, but they're sympathetic to the plight of the unfortunate Marines. These are men doomed to die lonely and meaningless deaths far from home. Overcome with sadness, the spirits take it upon themselves to bring some joy into these mortals' last days.<br/><br/>The problem: These spirits can see into the souls of men, but they only barely comprehend what they find there. They offer solace in the form of wishes fulfilled, but misunderstanding can turn a simple act of charity into one of perversion. As a suffering Marine facing inevitable death, trapped in a place equal parts heaven and hell, can you seek refuge in your heart while protecting it from corruption at the same time?<br/><br/>"

The fast approach of winter means food must be gathered, and as every ant knows, the clan that gathers the most food holds all the power in the Colony.  The race is on! Who will come out on top before the chill of winter sets in?<br/><br/>Autumn Ants is a game where 2 to 4 players take control of a clan of ants competing for control of their Colony.  Using a system of dice selection, players will explore the unknown meadow, gather seeds, build dirt walls to hold back their competitors, and maybe even build shrines to gain the blessings of their Ant-cestors! Hurry though, since winter comes sooner than any ant would like...<br/><br/>In Autumn Ants, players move their ant pawns around a randomly generated world, growing their ant colony to try to out compete their fellow players.  Each round, dice are rolled and each player will select one die.  This die will decide both turn order and a special action that can be used that round.  The player with the most food tokens brought back to their ant hill at game end will be the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Naruto Shippuden: The Board Game is a cooperative game based on the travels of Naruto and his friends at the beginning of the Naruto: Shippuden series.<br/><br/>The Akatsuki, a criminal ninja organization, are hunting Jinchuriki: humans who are host to tailed beasts, of which Naruto is one. Taking on the roles of Naruto, Sakura, Kakashi, Rock Lee, Sai and Shikamaru from the Hidden Leaf Village, players attempt to stop the Akatsuki from extracting the tailed beasts from their bearers and using them to power their ultimate weapon: The Ged&ocirc; Maz&ocirc;.<br/><br/>In more detail, the Akatsuki start at one of the nine villages on the game board, spend at most three turns in that village, then (if they're not defeated there) move to the next village. Each Akatsuki character has its own strengths and weaknesses. The villages are distant from one another, so players can't race from one village to another after them, but must divide their forces to prepare for conflict, encountering unexpected events along the way.<br/><br/>Each player has a character card showing Combat Ability, Chakra Reserve, and Strategy Value, as well as an experience track that allows them to power up over time. Each character also has a deck of fourteen ability cards, some common to each deck but most unique to that character.<br/><br/>Each turn a character takes two actions from move, meditate, or fight. When you fight, you roll dice, hoping for shuriken. You can play cards to increase the number of dice you roll, but you must spend Chakra to play them and both cards and Chakra are limited. The enemy fights back if you don't deal enough damage to it, possibly triggering special powers and additional effects in the process.<br/><br/>Once the Akatsuki arrive at Hidden Leaf Village, players must face Tobi and the Ged&ocirc; Maz&ocirc;, with their power being greater for each tailed beast that they stole on their way to this final showdown.<br/><br/>Naruto Shippuden: The Board Game features three levels of play and a large variety of enemies, making each game a unique experience.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "Ghostbusters: The Board Game II features an original story by Ghostbusters comics writer Erik Burnham in which the Ghostbusters investigate mood slime that has flooded the city, creating earthquakes and riots in another attempt to bring back Vigo and his minions. In line with the story, the map tiles in the game depict buildings destroyed by earthquakes and fires, as well as collapsed streets that expose sewers infested with slime, tunnels with derailed subway cars, and ghost trains.<br/><br/>This standalone game features new game elements that allow players to:<br/><br/><br/>    Switch between Proton and Slime Blower Packs with new custom figures and double-sided Character Cards.<br/>    Battle challenging new Plazm enemies that combine into stronger versions to attack and split up in defense; immune to Proton Streams, these phantoms can be taken down only by Ghostbusters wielding Slime Blower packs.<br/>    Use new ghosts to bring new Slime tokens that can inhibit the Ghostbusters' sight, movement, maneuvers and combat rolls.<br/>    Recover stolen experimental Ghostbusting equipment and level the playing field with new weapon, trap, utility and tome cards to survive challenging Event Cards and reap the rewards before things go from worse to apocalyptic.<br/><br/><br/>",

All playable characters are fixed - the game does not use (or allow) character generation.  The play style transpires in phases; during each phase one player's selected character is the focus of narrative attention and all other players assume supporting (minor) roles.

Later in the war, it was developed into a formidable night fighter, becoming the major night-fighting aircraft of the Luftwaffe. Great Aces that gloriously piloted this aircraft were Fritz Schupp, Georg Christl and G&uuml;nther Radusch. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards. This is not a complete game. To play, you must own a WW2 Rules and Accessories Pack or WW2 Starter Set.<br/><br/>Comes in a Schupp version, a Christl version, and a Radusch  version.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Colonial Space Wars: Invasion (CSW) is a sci-fi tactical wargame with 18mm scale miniatures that recreates battles between armies called Combat Swords. Each one is formed by a group of soldiers, drones or other creatures, represented in the game by metal or resin miniatures. These models move across a tabletop with scenery elements that emulate open battlefields, military complexes, the interior of buildings or spacecrafts.<br/><br/>CSW battles are resolved by Turns, in which each player acts alternatively. At the beginning of his Turn, one player will add to his pool the COMMAND points given by his LEADER or NODE units. COMMAND points available can be used then to activate units, and each unit requires a number of COMMAND points to be used.<br/><br/>A typical game is a Sudden Death match, where the winner is the player that eliminates their opponent&rsquo;s ability to activate units. However, in addition to this a description of advanced rules and missions for more experienced players is given.<br/><br/>",

If kept, the next card goes to the communal pile; if placed in the communal pile, the next card goes in your personal collection.<br/><br/>At the start of your turn, you can decide to use a container. If so, you assemble cards from personal and communal spaces, group them, then turn them all over. You have then &quot;collected&quot; those and can't use the container again.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, collectors determine the best collection as a combination of value from their collection, matching herbs, and herb sets.<br/><br/>",

You now may throw the dice again for another turn. You can only ever have one marker of each color. When your pawn gets to a color you already have a marker for, just answer the question but no further markers are earned.<br/><br/>When you answer the question wrong, your turn is over and the player to your left is the next player to throw the dice.<br/><br/>When you reach the finish (spot 160) you have to have collected a marker of each category. The other players decide in which category your final quaetion is asked. When aswering right you win and when aswering wrong you get another shot next turn.<br/><br/>"

Even mundane gems can be items of wondrous beauty, incredible value, and spectacular legend. They come in all shapes and sizes, in a rainbow of colors, and a wide range of clarities, from those as transparent as glass, that sparkle in the light, to ones that are completely opaque. Though they are dug from the ground, they are the domain of kings and queens, priceless works of art, and the greatest of treasures.<br/><br/>This book mines 11 brand new spells that explore these magical aspects of gems, and others. From first to ninth level, no magic is too small or too great for the magnificent gem. Inside this book you will find:<br/><br/>    A spell that turns a gem into a magical lens, revealing different things depending on what type of gem is used.<br/>    A spell that allows you to store your soul in a diamond upon your death, making it easier and safer to return yourself to life.<br/>    A spell that refracts light from a diamond to create eight beams of magical energy in different directions, each with a different color and effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>...and much more!<br/><br/>"

It is hard and often thankless work, taken for granted by those who can afford the goods only made possible by the tireless efforts of the miners. But the promise of decent pay is too much for so many who come from the lowest classes of planetside cultures, and those who yearn for a long vacation after their work is done.<br/><br/>But all is not what it seems.

        "description": "INTRODUCTION: TRENCH SOLDIERS is a solitaire game of Combat and Survival in the muddy trenches in France or Belgium during World War I. The player assumes the role of an Infantry Soldier during the grueling and miserable tour in the Trenches. As a Soldier, you are a member of a Rifle Platoon responsible for securing your Sectors of Front by successfully taking enemy positions and defending yours with the least amount of casualties. As you survive and gain experience, your Soldier will improve his attributes and gain skills to help him further survive the horrors of War in the Trenches.<br/> GAME OBJECTIVE <br/>The objective of TRENCH SOLDIERS is to successfully survive a Tour in the trenches along the Western Front during World War I. A Tour consists of a number of Rotations in the Trenches. The Player can play a Short Tour (1 Rotation), an Average Tour (2 Rotations) or a Long Tour (3 Rotations). Each Rotation consists of making a Rotation Deck of 20 &ldquo;Trench Life&rdquo; Cards and once all Trench Life Cards have been drawn and resolved, the Rotation is over and the Player totals his Rotation VP and adds it to his Tour VP. Once all Rotations have been completed, the Player totals his Tour VP and then compares it to the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success. Players can choose to play as the Germans, French, Commonwealth (British, Australian/New Zealanders or Canadians) or the Americans.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES: TRENCH SOLDIERS features plenty of colorful Game Counters and Game Mat. The Game provides plenty of grim themes associated with the War in the Trenches. Counters include Infantry Soldiers, HMGs, Flamethrowers, MK-IV Tanks, A7 Tanks, FT-17 Tanks, Pillboxes, Aircraft, Sub-Machineguns and Light Machineguns from the various Combatants. In addition to the standard Western Front Campaign Scenario there is, also, a Gallipoli/Palestine Campaign with supporting Terrain Markers and Counters for the Ottoman Turks.<br/><br/>TRENCH SOLDIERS can be found at the following URL:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.berserkergames.net' rel='nofollow'>http://www.berserkergames.net</a><br/><br/>"

Each player holds six cards at the beginning. In clockwise order, players play one card each. If it is higher than any other card currently on the table, the lower card is discarded and the player who had played it has to draw a new card. However, if two or more players play the same number, the card values are cumulated. When it's a player's turn and their card is still in front of them, they can discard it without redrawing. First player(s) to get rid of their cards wins.<br/><br/>Doppelt und Dreifach was anonymously sent to various people in March, 2016.

An anonymous informant recently identified an Aspis resurgence in Goka's Deepmarket, and Venture-Captain Amara Li hopes that a small, well-trained team can ferret out the villains and prevent any greater atrocities. Can the PCs traverse the Deepmarket's treacherous politics and tunnels and neutralize the Consortium's local ringleader?<br/><br/>Content in &quot;The Deepmarket Deception&quot; also contributes directly to the ongoing storyline of the retired Lantern Lodge faction. Content in this scenario also ties into a special metaplot element from Pathfinder Society Special #6&ndash;98: &quot;Serpents Rise&quot;.

The Pathfinder Society, as one of the crusade&rsquo;s partners in this endeavor, has earned the right to explore and salvage what it can of the lost Sarkorian sites under Mendev&rsquo;s control, and it has identified one ruin as a priority. In fact, the site seems to actively call to one agent in particular, a scarred survivor of abyssal experiments. Venture-Captain Jorsal of Lauterbury has asked the PCs to accompany this agent into the wasteland, where perhaps she might learn how to control her demonic half&mdash;or purge it completely.<br/><br/>Content in &ldquo;Thralls of the Shattered God&rdquo; also contributes directly to the ongoing storyline of the Silver Crusade faction.<br/><br/>"

The game consists of a single sheet of thick paper with various punch-out elements that serve as the spinner, game pieces and 3-dimensional scenery. Play is standard for this type of game, with players moving along a track from start to finish, with some spaces that may move them forward or backward or cause gain or loss of a turn. Some spaces also call for the player to complete an action such as waving arms to chase away flies or pretending to swim across a river. Others feature animal facts.

Following this guideline place as many broken tiles face up as you wish, across the table; representing the span of the Thunder Bridge.<br/>Each player chooses a token and places it on the second tile from the left (so there is one open tile behind the tokens &ndash; to their left).<br/><br/>Starting The Game<br/>The oldest player takes the die and rolls it, then play continues clockwise. He or she may move (to the right) the number of tiles the die displays, or may help other players move (to the right) by offering to share the number displayed with another player(s).<br/><br/>You may not end your turn on a broken tile. You must roll a number large enough to leap across (or fall into the chasm below -ending the game; everyone a loser).<br/><br/>Once each player has rolled the die and moved appropriately, one person (the youngest) rolls the die representing Thunder Bridge; the roll of a 1 or 2 causes two tiles to fall away into the chasm. The roll of a 0 or 3 causes one tile to fall into the chasm (remove them from the play area). Any player tokens on the lost tiles fall into the chasm below - ending the game; everyone a loser.<br/><br/>Continue playing until everyone is safely across the bridge (or any player is lost into the chasm).<br/><br/>Winning The Game<br/>The first player to get off the last bridge tile to the right (while assuring everyone else is safe) wins the game.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "8 Seconds is a press-your-luck dice and card game for 1-8 players about the action and excitement of bull riding in a rodeo.  Roll your dice and match your moves to the moves of the Bulls.  But beware the rodeo clowns!  There are only two on staff, so if you roll a third Rodeo Clown you'll have to fill in and you won&rsquo;t score your Bull!<br/><br/>Components consist of 8 dice, a deck of 28 Bull cards, 30 Foul Tokens, and 8 reference cards.<br/><br/>Dice can have one of five different values on each face: Turn, Buck, Kick, Blank, or Rodeo Clown.  Rodeo Clowns are kept, Blanks are rerolled, and everything else can either be kept or rerolled.<br/><br/>There is also a deck of 28 Bull cards.  Each Bull requires 3-7 dice to be placed on it.  Players must match their dice rolls to the moves indicated on the cards (turns, kicks, and bucks) in order to successfully ride the Bull.  At the start of a player's turn they draw three Bull cards and then roll the dice.  They can reroll dice as needed, according to the rules, until they either get Bucked Off (have three Rodeo Clowns, or too many Rodel Clowns to successfully ride a Bull), choose to Dismount, or successfully Go the Full Eight Seconds.  After each roll, including the initial roll, the player must discard one of the three Bull cards, until they are left with just one Bull to try to ride.  If they successfully ride a Bull before getting Bucked Off they'll get to collect that Bull card and earn the points indicated.<br/><br/>Throughout the game players can also earn Foul Tokens that let them reroll Rodeo Clown dice, add Bulls to their lineup, reroll without having to discard a Bull, or earn extra points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game goes until one player has successfully ridden three Bulls, and then everyone else gets a final turn.  The winner is the player with the most points in Bulls and Foul Tokens.<br/><br/>"

There are no characters attributes beyond whatever descriptions and history players care to create.  The game is played in phases; the rules recommend telling the stories in cut scenes placed in reverse chronological order.  Action resolution is nearly entirely narrative.  Two decks of custom cards are used to resolve conflict.<br/><br/>The custom cards are not provided, though their values are noted.  One deck contains fifteen &quot;color&quot; cards, with faces of specified colors.  The other deck contains forty Assertion Cards with four sets numbered 1-10.  In addition to using cards for conflict resolution, they can be traded for other in-game advantages as players see fit.<br/><br/>"

ULTIMA The Second Trilogy follows the spellbinding tale of the Avatar in the software industry's most richly detailed and challenging story. The setting is medieval Britannia, but the stories are timeless and involve universal issues that explore the essence of virtue.<br/><br/>First, there is the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment in ULTIMA IV, where your personal ethics are tested in a treacherous struggle to demonstrate the eight virtues of Avatarhood. Then, in ULTIMA V, you rely on your new-found strengths and skills to oppose a tyrannical leader who warps the virtues you uphold through his twisted legislation of morality. Finally, in the epic concluding chapter of ULTIMA VI, you, the Avatar, must resolve the cultural conflict between a race of hostile creatures and your own. It all adds up to a relentless test of character in a world where things are not always as they appear, and evil is not easily defined.<br/><br/>- Three games, totaling more than 5.5 megabytes, provide unbeatable, long-term play value. You may never see it all!<br/>- Visit thousands of colorful places and characters, search towns, castles and villages, converse with merchants and mages, all as you walk, ride and sail across Britannia.<br/>- Explore magic, combat and deception - weave hundreds of magical spells, watch axes and arrows fly in combat, discover clues and solve mysteries.<br/>- The character you create is transferrable through all three parts of the Avatar's story.<br/>- No previous Ultima experience is required to play or enjoy this Second Trilogy.<br/><br/>"

This version, remained the unique ever PC simulator for this type of approach known as well under the term GCA for Ground Control Approach. Although it starts as a normal Terminal Area Control, at the moment a flight is put on its final track, by pressing the F2 key, the aircraft was transferred to the GCA position and the screen was changed to the equivalent Precision Approach Radar one, while the rest of the traffic was actually 'frozen', meaning that you could continue control this single aircraft and after landing, you could then move over to the previous Terminal Area Control to keep on with the rest of the traffic that had stayed at the moment you moved to the GCA position. All the commands for this particular type of control were available additionally to the standard ones for TRACON.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tracon II&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"

In the game, the player finds their character transported to strange alien worlds but with human elements within the settings. The player must explore and solve puzzles to figure out how to return home.<br/><br/>Internally, the game was developed with the mantra of &quot;Myst in space&quot;; comparable to Myst's Ages, the player explores different alien worlds, with means to travel back and forth between them similar to the Linking books. Though they initially wanted to move away from being too Myst-like, treating the title as a spiritual successor, they found that during development they were naturally brought back to structuring the game similar to Myst. The game will include three non-player characters (NPCs), which originally were planned to be rendered and animated within the game's engine, but by March 2015, Cyan decided to return to the use of full-motion video of live actors that will be incorporated into the game, in the same manner as they used in Riven.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Obduction (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"

But, is this place safe from modern day carpet baggers? Can folks truly live in harmony with nature? State of Jefferson explores the crossroads of modern living colliding with notions of true freedom.<br/><br/>Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.<br/><br/>Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.<br/><br/>"

The game was published in a series of forum posts as a competition entry.  Access to the rules is complicated because numerous posts revise rules from previous posts, and no &quot;final&quot; version of the game was offered.  Also, several references were made to offsite card files (the cards containing information needed for play) that are no longer available.<br/><br/>The card game itself - the core of the roleplaying game - is quite complex and involves numerous special types of cards, each with their own rules for play.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "22ra (translated &ldquo;to 22&rdquo; points) is a card-driven game that simulates basque hand-pelota  games between 2 players, or 4 players when playing doubles. The objective is to score 22 points by playing cards, so that the opponent cannot or does not want to reach the ball or makes a foul when hitting the ball.<br/><br/>The game consists of three separate decks of cards: <br/><br/>         The Player Trait&rsquo;s cards, consisting of <br/>             Movement cards (Mugimendu) <br/>             Force cards (Indar), and<br/>             Skill cards (Abilezia)<br/>        <br/>         The Serve Deck (Sake), with <br/>             Normal serve cards (Arrunta) and<br/>             Risky serve cards (Ausarta) <br/>        <br/>         The Hit Deck, which consists of three Subdecks: <br/>             The Bounce Back cards (Botez Atzera), the ball is hit after it bounces<br/>             The Defence Volley cards (Airez Defentsa), the ball is hit before it bounces<br/>             The Good-play cards (Jokaldia), with different special hits and plays. <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The board represents the fronton, divided in 7 squares (A1, A2, B1, B2, D, F and R), contains also a scoring track and 5 Timeout spaces for each player (Atsedenaldiak).<br/><br/>Each player chooses seven Player Trait cards, at least 4 Movement cards. Then each player is dealt 4 Good-play cards. A start player is chosen randomly (the server in the first point) and the game can begin: the server chooses a Serve card. If the serve is good, the receiver must hit it back either after the ball bounces (from the same square where the ball is, using a Bounce Back card) or before the ball bounces (from the square directly in front of the ball, using a Defence Volley card). Play continues until one player fails to hit the ball (cannot/does not want to hit or hits a ball badly), therefore losing the point (Falta) or the other player makes a great hit, directly winning the point (Tanto). After each point, the players recover a Player Trait card and replenish their hand of Good-play cards (up to 4 cards). The first player reaching 22 points wins immediately the game.<br/><br/>In double games, the teams are formed by a Forward and a Defender, and the games are also played to 22 points. The rules are the same, except that each player chooses 4 Player Trait cards (at least 2 Movement cards) and that they can exchange the Good-play cards before the start of each point.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>First introduced with the Lost City of Barakus Kickstarter, the Sinnar Coast region map detailed thousands of square miles of territory stretching from Rappan Athuk in the north all the way to the Domain of Hawkmoon far to the south. While many locations on the map are familiar from old Necromancer Games titles and more recent Frog God Games products, the map itself did little to tell the story of this region and even less to answer questions that it raised: Who rules beyond the Gaelon River? What hazards and ruins await south of the well-known dungeons of Rappan Athuk and Barakus? And, what has led to this land becoming known as the Sundered Kingdoms?<br/><br/>As part of the ongoing strategy of Frog God Games to take older and hard-to-find Necromancer Games products and update them not only to new Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Swords &amp; Wizardry Complete rules but also to incorporate them into the Lost Lands setting as a way to introduce them to fans old and new alike, Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms takes three classic Necromancer Games adventures: Patrick Lawinger&rsquo;s Morrick Mansion, Casey W. Christofferson&rsquo;s Aberrations, and Dave Brohman&rsquo;s Crystal Skull and integrates them into a continuous plot for an adventure path that takes PCs from level 3 to 15+, perfect for the party that has finished exploring the dungeons beneath Barakus and is looking for the next road to adventure.<br/><br/>But Cults of the Sundered Kingdoms is much more than just an update of those three previously published adventures. To the adventure path it adds three new original adventures written by Greg A. Vaughan called The Beast Within, Shades of Yellow, and Vengeance in the Hollow Hills that both tie in with the three older adventures and also move the plot from one to the next to create the continuity of the adventure path. While you could play any or all of the six adventures as standalone sessions, you can also use them as a single contiguous campaign to explore a large region of the Lost Lands.<br/><br/>"

About four months ago old Lady Mohray passed on, though nobody knows exactly when since she had obviously been dead for some time when her body was found. Father Kamryn, of the Shrine of Selinay, buried the old eccentric in the wild remnants of the garden behind her manor-house and, since she had no relatives closer than Waterford, the dilapidated old house has stood empty since. Now though, strange noises have been heard from the house and the people of Lamber's Market have started saying that the house is haunted but nobody has quite had the nerve to investigate... until now.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/><br/>The PDF typically is distributed in a ZIP archive that also includes a one-page JPG file presenting a map of the entire structure.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Microlite75 Basic rules are based on three little booklets found in the boxed set of the 1974 original edition (0e) of the world&rsquo;s most popular tabletop fantasy roleplaying game. The rules are not intended to be a clone of the 0e rules, but rather a conversion of them to a rules-lite D20-based system that encourages old-school play without strictly old-school rules. Microlite75 Basic is based on the third edition of the original Microlite74 rules, modified to use advancement and experience systems closer to those of the original game and including some of more popular systems from Microlite74 Extended (e.g. Body Points and Backgrounds).<br/><br/>Although the Microlite75 Basic rules are complete, they are fairly basic. There are only three classes (Fighters, Magic-Users, and Clerics) -- however, backgrounds allow a great deal of easy character customization. Spells are limited and character levels top out at 12 to 14. Microlite75 Standard and Microlite75 Extended provide more classes and other options.<br/><br/>This book contains the complete rules for Microlite75 Basic. This book includes:<br/><br/>    Simple Character Creation Rules: Roll 4 attributes and select a race, class, background, and (optionally) alignment.<br/>    Limited Classes as in original 0e boxed set: Fighter, Magic-User, and Cleric.<br/>    Backgrounds provide a simple and fast way to factor in a character's culture and non-class-related abilities.<br/>    Simple and fast-playing combat system that tracks physical damage (aka body points) separately from luck/skill/fatigue (aka hit point) damage.<br/>    Hit points recover with a night&rsquo;s rest. Spells cost hit points to cast. Actual wounds recover more slowly.<br/>    Rules for hirelings; monster reactions (not every monster wants to fight); morale (not every monster fights to the death); strongholds; magical research; dungeon, wilderness and ocean exploration; and more.<br/>    A complete list of spells, monsters, and treasure.<br/>    Compatible with most other 0e based games and adventures.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Each player is responsible for building their lineage and defending their family members from rival families.<br/><br/>This is done through a family tree style playing field. Players begin the game with a Noble House Card that shows both a Lord and Lady. From there, players use Court Drama Cards to arrange marriages and have children and thereby grow their family tree. Each character can play two Court Drama Cards on their turn to maintain and develop their own family tree, or attack their rivals.<br/><br/>In addition to helping characters wed and have children, some Court Drama Cards also let players make others illegitimate or infertile, preventing them from winning the throne. Likewise, other Court Drama Cards allow players to remove these negative effects and to restore themselves to their former glory.<br/><br/>In order to win the throne, a noble family must produce at least one great-grandson that is of age and neither illegitimate nor infertile.<br/><br/>",

Action Cards represent what you&rsquo;re up to in the darkness of the Museum, like sneaking, swiping, stashing and stealing. But while you're collecting loot, remember to keep a close eye on the remaining time and the alerted Security to plan the perfect getaway. Escape from the Museum with the most valuable works of art, and pull off the grandest heist of all time!<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s Different about Master Thief?<br/><br/>When designing the functions of Master Thief we used probability matrices to craft the most variety and build the most tension. The game is meant to incite visceral emotion from its players and even a few arguments.<br/><br/>Some combinations of cards and items offer interesting strategies that are purposefully left vague, this allows for what we&rsquo;re calling The Jury of Thieves. In a Jury of Thieves players are given the chance to decide the fate of their opponents and their actions by majority vote. This is a great way to earn your opponents&rsquo; trust and an even better way to make enemies.<br/><br/>In the museum you&rsquo;ll also be able to steal charmed items. Charms provide new and exciting ways to manipulate the functions of the game. We&rsquo;re very excited about these in particular, because they have allowed us the opportunity to explore the use of specialty printing with AdMagic. Standard items in the museum will give the illusion of a dark and stealthy heist, but the Charmed items will shimmer with a golden hue using holofoil applications.<br/><br/>"

Six dice are rolled and re-rolled until a player decides to stop, or &quot;busts&quot;.<br/><br/>The dice are split into 3 types. Six &ldquo;sea&rdquo; dice are used for the initial rolls, this is where players try to rescue survivors; 9 &ldquo;Dicelantis&rdquo; dice form an island in the middle of the table; and 3 &ldquo;Treachery&rdquo; dice provide a take-that mechanism to spoil the plans of other players<br/><br/>The Dicelantis dice act as a countdown mechanism in the game. As the game progresses the island of Dicelantis is washed away by the tide and these dice are claimed in front of players.<br/><br/>Players try to collect as many survivors as they can from the roiling seas surrounding Dicelantis. As it sinks beneath the waves, the Dicelantis dice also give the players the option of claiming Treachery dice. By claiming these black dice, players can keep hold of them for end game points, or add them to an opponent&rsquo;s cup, bringing catastrophe to the target player and seizing an exciting victory!<br/><br/>"

No one knows how to play this mysterious game &mdash; until now when this ancient game is reborn as Ominoes.<br/><br/>In this abstract strategy/tactical game, 2-4 players want to collect their favored gods &mdash; Horus, Ra, Apep, and Khepri &mdash; in groups to earn points. They do this by rolling custom dice that both determine actions and are placed on the game board to count as a piece of the player's color. On a turn, the active player does the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Roll: Take a die and roll it.<br/>    Move: Move a die on the board that matches the rolled color exactly three spaces.<br/>    Place: Placing the die just rolled on the board, possibly scoring a group.<br/><br/><br/>The dice have four faces matching the players colors, with unused colors in a two- or three-player game being scorable by anyone. The other two faces &mdash; &quot;Yay-Ra&quot; and &quot;Ominotep&quot; &mdash; allow the player to move or reroll any die, respectively, and they count as wild once on the board. Groups of four (or more) dice of a color are scored immediately and give their player points equal to their number. The first player to 13 points (or 21 points in a two-player game)wins!<br/><br/>Quick to learn, easy to play but with layers of light tactics. Ominoes is 15 minutes of play.<br/><br/>",

Whether you&rsquo;re looking to populate a memorable encounter or a villainous story arc, our Monster of the Week is made for maximum creepfactor and memorable &ldquo;wow&rdquo; power!<br/><br/>Within this installment&rsquo;s pages you will find the true and terrible description of the lump hag &ndash; a twisted crone with tragic origins. Disquieting and gruesome in the extreme, the lump hag makes an excellent choice for horror-themed adventures and encounters, as well as those designed to illicit feelings of uneasiness in your players. The lump hag might also serve well for certain sorts of mystery adventure, as each hag might incorporate elements of local history into the truth of her own origins. Take a seat by the fire and read on, my friends, and hear the tale of a once-lovely lass turned mindlessly-miserable, hunchbacked old crone; a tragic hag whose doom she inherited from her equally-monstrous mother&hellip;<br/><br/>"

        "description": "It is 21st century America--a place where money talks and politicians listen. In this game, you are a member of the uber-wealthy class and you use your fortune to bribe and influence law makers.<br/><br/>The game is a 2-player revision of Slush Fund.  While it has similar mechanics and ideas, there are important rule changes that make it quite a different game.  In the game, players use money cards to bribe 5 different politicians in an effort to score Victory Points for having the highest bribes on politicians at game end. The politicians start with a base value of VPs, but these may change during the game.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws 3 cards from the deck, chooses 2 of them to play, and places 1 in the Slush Fund (a face-up pile of presently unused cards).  If there are at least 3 cards in the Slush Fund, the player may choose to take 3 cards from the Slush Fund instead of drawing from the deck. In this case, however, the player can use all 3 cards. In addition to money cards, there are special cards, such as the Investigator, Journalist, Larcenist, and Accountant. Each of these provides a unique special power.<br/><br/>The game contains 54 cards and is packaged in a tuck box for ease of portability.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, the vast majority of monsters available for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game are terrifying foes for adults, and few responsible parents would set a mohrg or succubus against players under the age of eight. Beyond that, the base game assumes a foe is generally defeated through battle, which isn&rsquo;t always the best lesson for impressionable young minds.<br/><br/>Monsters Under the Bed is here to help! The Four Horsemen believe RPGs should be enjoyed by gamers of all ages, so we&rsquo;ve both put together templates to make any existing monsters more child-friendly (from potentially adorable Baby Monsters to the cowardly or thorn-in-it&rsquo;s paw Weakened monster), and specific creatures (closet creature, candy golem, boogren gremlin, haunted house, and white hag).<br/><br/>We also provide plot hooks for each template and monster, to help spark ideas for family-friendly adventures!<br/><br/>So get ready for all-ages adventure. There IS something under your bed!<br/><br/>"
