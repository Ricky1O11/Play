Every product I am currently cooking up is living in this little bugger's shadow and, really, that's not a bad position to be in. So, yes, thank you so very much! As I've said time and time again, it's you who keep the hamster wheel turning around here!<br/><br/>Given their ability to command hordes of mindless and subservient minions, there has always been a bit of a rivalry between tinkers and necromancers. It is not a blood feud, by any stretch of the imagination. Rather, it can be thought of as much like the rivalries that exist between various educational institutions or between two professions that rub together the wrong way at times, much like alchemists and physicians. This rivalry, in a rather amusing paradox given how the two parties dislike each other, brings about an exchange of culture. Invariably, such a cultural exchange (the sort with a bit of acid between the two parties) brings about those individuals who attempt to bridge the gap between the two by embracing the tenants of both at once. These are the mechromancers, tinkers who have delved deeply enough into the necromantic arts to command both a squadron of mechanical minions and a squadron of undead minions. As they progress down this path, the line between machine and corpse blurs until it finally becomes one, at which point the two camps whose views they were attempting to integrate invariably agree that the mixture of the two concepts is an abomination and the mechromancer must be banished.<br/><br/>The mechromancer is a mixture of spellcaster and tinker. Requiring both the alpha and the animate dead spell to qualify, among other, lesser requirements, the mechromancer fills the role that the mystic theurge does for conventional casters: useful abilities piled onto full progression in both of your esoteric arts. Unlike the mystic theurge, the mechromancer is only a 5 level prestige class. Also, given magic and tinkering tends to mesh less well than magic and more magic, the class has a glut of small, useful abilities to help blend the two ideas together in a logical fashion.<br/><br/>The Mechromancer at a glance:<br/><br/>     Full spell and invention progression<br/>     The Blue Screen of Undeath ability, which allows the mechromancer to raise fallen automatons as &quot;zombie robots&quot;<br/>     Mechromantic Grafts, which allows the mechromancer to add dead tissue to each of his blueprints for some rather potent benefits<br/>     Beacon of Undeath, which causes the mechromancer's alpha to emit a permanent desecrate effect, and eventually some benefits of the unhallow spell<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "144002": {"rpgartist": ["Kristen M.

The Wild West was characterized by famous heroes, villains, lawmen and outlaws. Players will now be able to choose a side and hire either classic White Hat or Black Hat type characters. The good guys, called Rebels, have abilities that assist players in accomplishing goals. The bad guys, called Rogues, can harass opponents and even rob from them. Players can opt to exclude Rogues or add in a variant that allows characters to initiate gunfights and capture Rogues.<br/><br/>Reputation adds in a thematic decision that can affect player&rsquo;s options in many of the expansion variants. For example, additional Action Cards will be introduced that will have two options on them. Players will only be able to select the option that corresponds to their Reputation.

Simple to understand and great fun, Agricola lets everyone play to the end in a race to see who can build the most productive farm.<br/>Easy To Play!<br/><br/>Agricola is a turn-based game, played in six Stages and 14 Rounds. On a turn, players place a family member token on a location in town in order to collect resources or to take actions to improve their farm. They can get building materials such as wood and clay, plow fields and sow crops, or build fences to keep animals. New actions become available at the start each round and resources get replenished on any taken in the previous round.<br/><br/>At harvest crops are reaped, newborn animals arrive and you must feed your family. Growing your family gives you more actions but means you have more mouths to feed!<br/><br/>The player with the most productive and advanced farm at the end of 14 rounds is the winner. Victory Points are awarded for the number of fields and pastures you have, as well as for crops and animals. Additional points are awarded for extension and renovation of the family's home, for the number of family members, and for played Occupation and Improvement cards.

Once you've solved all the colored squares, you will have a large illustration of 80x80.<br/><br/>The micross puzzles in this game are themed after world-famous paintings.

CIC lockout chips and FX chips are no longer going to be an issue, as we aim to achieve 100% compatibility with all cartridges.<br/><br/>On the front of the console, there is a power button to turn on the console, and adjacent to this button, is a sync button. This button will allow you to sync up to 4 wireless controllers to one console, allowing you to play multiplayer compatible titles without the use of a multitap.<br/><br/>On the back of the console, will be a standard AV output, a USB port to allow for charging of the wireless controller, an AC Adapter to power up the system, and a HDMI output for HDTV connectivity.<br/><br/>Along the sides of the console, are controller ports for the SNES, Genesis, and NES, totalling 6 controller ports, allowing for users to use their original controllers. Users will also be able to use any controller they desire for any system. That means, if you want use a SNES controller to play Genesis games, the RetroN 5 will allow you to do so.<br/><br/>The RetroN 5 will come with a wireless controller that utilizes Bluetooth technology, allowing for a playable distance of a minimum of 15 feet without losing sync from the console. This new controller will also have a Microswitch Directional Pad instead of a traditional directional pad. Along with 6 face buttons, two shoulder buttons, a start and select button, and 4 LED light indicators to display the player number, there is also a Home button that will serve multiple functions; one is to sync the controller to the console, but to also gain access to the Game User Interface (GUI) at any point during gameplay. There are also two Macro buttons that will allow you to program. Every controller will have a rechargeable lithium ion battery than can be charged through any USB port via the micro USB cable.<br/><br/>When you power on the RetroN 5 for the first time, you will notice, that the user will be taken to a digital user interface. We have created a new system menu that will allow for users to select which system they would like to play, as well as access features that we felt were important to gamers.<br/><br/>Most games did not allow for you to freely save your games. The RetroN 5 will allow you to save their games at any point during gameplay, and will feature an autosave feature upon shutdown. You will be able to load your saves at anytime during gameplay.<br/><br/>The RetroN 5 will up convert the video signal to show clearer and cleaner images, with vibrant colors on an HDTV with a resolution output of up to 720p through the use of shaders. You will also be able to select the aspect ratio in our GUI, from the standard 4:3 to the HD ratio of 16:9. Our goal is to fill up as much of the screen as possible.<br/><br/>Overall audio output quality will be improved through the utilization of audio interpolation, a method of making digital sound better than it really is, resulting in a smoother, cleaner audio output. As a sound wave enters an ADC (analog to digital converter), samples are taken at timed intervals. Higher sample rates produce better recordings, but also require the use of more memory. As a result, to conserve space, most developers used sound that was of lower quality. What interpolation does is instead of repeating each low quality sample, it creates new samples between the originals. As a result, it creates a smoother, crisper sound output than the original sound.<br/><br/>Users will be able to program the controller to assign buttons to their preference. In turn, the RetroN 5 will save these custom layouts, so that users will not have to constantly reconfigure the button configuration. This feature will also be available to people wanting to remap their buttons on their original controllers.<br/><br/>The RetroN 5 will allow for manual and passive overclocking, giving the users the ability to speed up or slow down their games as they see fit. This option will be available on our GUI, and users will have the ability to access this at any time during gameplay by utilizing the 'Home' button on the controller. You will also be able to utilize this function by programming the Macro buttons on the wireless controller as well.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "144057": {"statistics": [], "name": "RetroN 2", "videogamehwversion": ["Black RetroN 2", "Gray RetroN 2"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "4", "videogamehwmfg": ["Hyperkin"], "poll": [], "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Console"], "videogamehardware": ["NES", "SNES"], "description": "&quot;Play all your classic Nintendo favorites with the RetroN 2 two-in-one system!

You may move your pawns around a maze of streets, back alleys and even make use of the Underground train system. The three interior tiles have police stations, the nine outside tiles have evidence locations.  The object of this game is to score the most victory points.  Victory points are earned by moving your &quot;police&quot; pawn around the game board to various named evidence locations, acquiring the evidence and returning the evidence to one of three police stations.  When you attempt to find the piece of evidence you decide how valuable it will be, the more valuable the harder it is to find.  During your game turn you also move one of nine &quot;bad&quot; guy pawns.  When moved adjacent to another players pawn you may pay the &quot;bad&quot; guy to attempt to steal various items from the player (money, tools, or evidence).

Its concept is a heavy departure from other installments in the Final Fantasy series, providing a darker and more realistic atmosphere that focuses on human emotions and believable characters. The game features expansive environments and a seamless and customizable battle system, which gives players great freedom regarding their preferred play method.<br/><br/>The story is based on the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythology, but has no direct relation to the other games in this series as it features a unique world, visual design and different characters. Its main protagonist, Noctis, is the prince of a mafia-like royal family which protects the last remaining crystal in the world and rules over a technologically advanced city-state. The plot centers on the invasion of a medieval war nation that tries to conquer the crystal. During the course of the game, Noctis meets the aristocratic and kind Stella who shares his ability of seeing a mysterious 'light' connected to a goddess of the dead.<br/><br/>Final Fantasy XV started production shortly before its announcement in May 2006, when it was initially unveiled under the title Final Fantasy Versus XIII (\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30b5\u30b9XIII Verusasu S\u0101t\u012bn) alongside Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Agito XIII (which was later renamed to Final Fantasy Type-0). The game's long development time and absence from the public eye gave rise to several rumors concerning its possible cancellation or shift to another platform. In June 2013, it was eventually revealed to have been renamed and switched systems from PlayStation 3 to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Final Fantasy XV is being developed by a team within Square Enix's 1st Production Department and directed by Tetsuya Nomura, who also designed the characters and conceived the concept and base story.<br/><br/>Final Fantasy XV is an action role-playing game with third-person shooter elements. The player character is seen from a third-person perspective that will be adjusted depending on the weapon currently equipped. The game's environments among others include kingdoms and villages and allow for much freedom and interactivity: for example, objects can be destroyed and different paths may be chosen to reach a destination. The world map is a wide, open field that the player can traverse on foot or by using a car, an airship or a chocobo. A day-and-night time system affects the appearance of monsters on the world map. Final Fantasy XV uses interactive cutscenes in the form of real-time events. The player keeps control during them as the gameplay is not interrupted, which will result in natural progressions and storytelling that is similar to that of first-person shooters. However, the game also features uncontrollable pre-rendered full motion videos (FMVs) for scenes in which player control would have little effect. The ratio of real-time event scenes and pre-rendered FMVs is 7:3.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "144122": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Robert G.

The game is richly historic, and keeps players within historic parameters in such a way that alliances and politics can shift, depending on how the war is going, but only within the limits of historic possibilities. Some city-states of the Delos Confederation may ally with Athens, while others may ally with Sparta, for example. Athens vs Sparta includes four scenarios: The Archidamian War (431 - 422), The Peace of Nicias and the Sicilian Expedition (421 &ndash; 413), The Ionian War (412 &ndash; 404), and the campaign scenario covering the entire war.<br/><br/>The game includes one 22x34&quot; map of the Grecian Mediterranean, including Sicily and southern Italy, and as far east as the Persian empire, 280 counters of all participants in the Peloponnesian War.

Each player starts with a tiny Starting Island made out of 7 hex tiles. Players will expand their islands in order to mine stone, ore and gather wood needed to build the more advanced buildings. Players will grow food and wine to keep their soldiers and wizards loyal and collect mana to cast powerful Spells.<br/><br/>In Fantasy Islands, many roads lead to victory: Pure Military force, Naval supremacy, securing the Trade monopoly, keeping your population happy, Cultural dominance or Spellcasting power. Excelling at one or more of these aspects will net you the VP needed to win and furthermore, players will be able to engage in Conflicts (Military, Trade, Sorcery, Cultural and Naval) which, in case they emerge victorious, will get them certain benefits.<br/><br/>This game is a cooperative effort by Andreas Propst (Austria) and Tobias Strunz (Germany).<br/><br/>"}, "144141": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jean-Philipe Chapleau"], "rpgitemversion": ["Free RPG Day 2013 Print Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Temple of the Forbidden God", "rpgartist": ["Anthony Cournoyer", "Rick Hershey", "Ean Moody", "Yamand\u00fa Daniel Orce", "Jason Walton"], "rpgproducer": ["Joshua Yearsley"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1695206.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["NeoExodus: A House Divided"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Louis Porter Jr. Design, Inc."], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Free RPG Day 2013"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1695206_t.jpg", "description": "From back cover:<br/><br/>First, a man covered in moving tattoos is found floating in a river.

The object of the game is to capture the most situation cards with the appropriate polite responses.&quot;<br/><br/>Gameplay description:<br/><br/>Cards are dealt to each player (child). The remaining cards form a draw pile. The dealer turns cards over from the draw pile until s/he reaches a &quot;situation&quot; card. (Others are mixed back into the pile.)<br/><br/>The dealer announces the situation and the youngest player (presumably to help children learn politeness and pragmatics starting at a young age) figures out whether s/he has the appropriate response card. If so, s/he says so and takes the situation card as a matched pair with his/her response card.<br/><br/>Else, the player takes a draw card and further, the game's rules require the child state, &quot;Now you try, please&quot; and the next player or opponent to respond, &quot;Thank you&quot; as an additional method of reinforcing politeness. If the next player has the corresponding response card, s/he may claim the pair. Otherwise, s/he draws a card and play continues so on and so forth.<br/><br/>If a player is able to match a response card to a situation card, s/he become dealer. A series of formalistic polite exchanges must be had between the players and if any player forgets the appropriate phrase, such as, &quot;May I give you a situation, please?&quot; then the offending player must hand his opponent a response card or draw until he gets one to hand over.<br/><br/>The winner is the one with the most pairs.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this game focuses not only on physical game mechanics but social dynamics to reinforce its educational affect.

Each challenge consists of a parcours built out of the wooden blocks according to the challenge card you draw randomly from three piles: A - C, from easy to difficult. After having built the landscape course, you have to push, pull, lift, slide or swing the &quot;trapper&quot; from the start to the end block. This trapper has a metal eye on top, and you move it with a wooden rod with a hook at its end. Some challenges require an intermediate string between rod and pawn, while others require both hands to simultaneously move pawn and grizzly bear, the bear being another wooden piece. A third kind of piece to be moved is provisions, which you &quot;kick&quot; with the trapper.<br/><br/>When you master the challenge, the next player decides whether to change to the next parcours or try to master the same one again. Depending on the difficulty of the challenge, your piece can move 2-4 steps toward the summit. If you lose track, fall down, or lose your provisions, you have lost this challenge and must move backward!

There&rsquo;s been at least one new Sentai series on Japanese television each and every year since the late 70s, and thanks to the success of the Power Rangers, similar shows have been a staple of American kid&rsquo;s television for two decades now.<br/><br/>Sentai adventures emphasize teamwork: an elite squad of 5-6 colorful, spandex-clad superheroes use phenomenal gadgets, martial arts talent and equally colorful giant robots to battle alien monsters the size of small office buildings. As a genre, Sentai is predicable and formulaic to a fault: each episode follows a similar pattern. The Sentai team investigates some crisis, fights some low level adversaries until the episode&rsquo;s real villain reveals itself. After battling the episode&rsquo;s mastermind to a standstill, the villain grows to enormous size thanks to vile magic or alien technology, and to finally destroy the villain, the heroes must do the same, activating their own mecha or tapping into size changing circuitry built into their costume.<br/><br/>Alone, you&rsquo;re powerful. You&rsquo;re a skilled martial artist wearing an armored body stocking capable of shrugging off small arms fire and backed by an array of crime fighting gadgets years more advanced than anything else on Earth.

Jak and Poi builds on this &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; concept and the result is an accessible one-card-per-turn game that has surprising depth and strategy.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to reduce your opponent&rsquo;s 20 life points to zero. To do this, each player uses the 2 main card types in the game: Jaks and Pois. The main mechanic of the game revolves around how these two card types interact with each other. Since Jaks (representing Rock, Paper, Scissors) can counter against or synergize with Pois (representing your lighting, bomb, tank, etc.) correctly anticipating your opponent&rsquo;s moves or leading your opponent to play in your favor is key to victory.<br/><br/>While unique, the gameplay of Jak and Poi is only half the reason the game is so special. Leveraging on the fact that every one of us, at some point in our childhood, invented our own hand symbols to try and win at Rock, Paper, Scissors, we crowdsourced the creation of all the cards in the game from players and artists who wanted to let their imaginations run wild.<br/><br/>The two decks in Jak and Poi&rsquo;s first release are the result of the efforts of 40+ designers and 20+ artists.

Each player will select a cycling team and take responsibility for managing the movements of 5-6 riders in their team. The aim of each team will be to secure victory at the end of each stage or in the general classification.<br/><br/>The course is built from hexagonal tiles.  Each hexagon tile is divided in turn into three spaces, with each space representing a kilometre of the race. Mountain sections, intermediate sprints and the finish line are shown using indicator tokens placed at the kilometre points agreed upon by the players at the beginning of the race.<br/><br/>This game comes in three versions: Junior, Senior and Master.  Each version builds on the rules of previous versions.   In the Junior version each rider is moved by rolling two six-sided dice.  Riders in a peloton (at least five riders in the same space) may choose not to roll and instead move five spaces.  A rider in the peloton may choose to roll in the hope of raising its pace or of breaking away (roll of 10-12).  The difficulty of the mountain sections is represented by rolling just one dice.  Each team has five water bottles that can be spent to move a rider an extra space (cost of one bottle on the flat, 2 bottles in mountains).  The rider furthest across the finish line at the end of a turn is the winner.<br/><br/>The Senior version introduces different categories of climb and gives each team member a role (climber, sprinter, rouleur, domestique (flat or mountain), and lantern rouge).  Each role has particular abilities.  Each team may launch one attack by rolling four dice instead of the normal two.  Falls, fast descents and falling back to join a team-mate are also represented.<br/><br/>The Master version makes use of software accessed through the publisher&rsquo;s website to enable whole tours to be run.<br/><br/>"}, "144461": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Seb\u0109jo"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Kvaredroj", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3126660_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Seb\u0109jo"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)", "The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3126660.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Esperanto edition", "Multilingual pocket size edition", "Stone prototype"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "A 2 players abstract game that uses a bunch of d4. <br/>The goal is to capture the opponent's 4 target dice.<br/>The dice can move as many times as shown on their current position but one can chose to use one turn to change the value on one die instead of moving.<br/>Any captured non-target die is rerolled and replaced on the board, so placement and adjusting values is often a better option than attacking the opponent's dice.<br/><br/>"}, "144462": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1756099.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Seb\u0109jo"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Sir John Tenniel"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "The Game Crafter, LLC"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1756099_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fantasy", "Novel-based", "Print & Play"], "description": "\u011caber\u016doko (Jabberwock) is a trick taking card game with an Alice in Wonderlands theme where players must fulfill different contracts (20 available), sometimes trying to take some specific cards, sometimes avoiding them.<br/>The game contains standard Ace-&gt;10 cards and three different Jabberwocks in each color.

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the war merged into the greater conflict of World War II as a major front of what is broadly known as the Pacific War. The Second Sino-Japanese War was the largest Asian war in the 20th century. It also made up more than 50% of the casualties in the Pacific War if the 1937&ndash;1941 period is taken into account. Although the two countries had fought intermittently since 1931, total war started in earnest in 1937 and ended only with the surrender of Japan in 1945.<br/><br/>In this game, you, the player, lead China&rsquo;s Army (KMT Central Army) to fight against Japanese invasion.

You might be taking winners of the Culling to meet a Starliner around Europa station, or supplies to and from Io.  Something goes wrong, and someone winds up seeing something they shouldn't.  DE finds out something is off, and a patrol ship goes to investigate.<br/><br/>(2) Escape and Pursuit: your characters know the awful truth: the Demosians do send the winners of the Culling off to Jupiter, but there are no starliners taking them to Wonderland: they are used as incubation chambers for Demosian eggs.  When the larvae hatch, they slowly eat their way out of the paralyzed hosts.  Those culled on the other hand are used as fresh meat for adult Demosians, and occasionally recycled as cheap meat for human fast food restaurants a la soylent green.  You&rsquo;ve heard of something called Haven on pirate broadcasts, a place safe from the aliens, and you&rsquo;ve stolen or hijacked a ship and are trying to find it.  The Demosian Enforcers of course are trying to find you.<br/><br/>(3) Rebellion: In an Earth-based game, the PCs can be fighting a rebel war, probably mostly covert, against the Demosians.

Not only do they have to maintain a handle on the stage they are setting, but they also have to keep things interesting. A lot of times a GM will look towards a pre-made adventure - many of which require players to do A then B then C to get D, etc. - to save some time in the game preparation. Just as many times, players will start at A then send their characters to X, destroy C, and then run away from D to get to M. All the GM's planning in the world cannot account for every action the players want their characters to take.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst situation in which a GM can find himself results when a player character (&quot;PC&quot;) is trying to have an unforseen conversation with a non-player character (&quot;NPC&quot;). For example, the Mayor that Dooley wants to meet. The GM could just ignore the player's request and say that the Mayor says nothing interesting. Another GM could use the Mayor to get the PC's back on track with the prepared adventure. A GM could take a break to flesh out the area the PC's want to explore.<br/><br/>This supplement attempts to help a GM create interesting NPC's on the fly so that if the third option is taken, the task is simpler and the results fun. Instead of just a stereotypical Mayor (whatever that may be), with a few die rolls a Mayor can be created with a history, motivations, and even a reason to speak with the PC's.
