Every product I am currently cooking up is living in this little bugger's shadow and, really, that's not a bad position to be in. So, yes, thank you so very much! As I've said time and time again, it's you who keep the hamster wheel turning around here!<br/><br/>Given their ability to command hordes of mindless and subservient minions, there has always been a bit of a rivalry between tinkers and necromancers. It is not a blood feud, by any stretch of the imagination. Rather, it can be thought of as much like the rivalries that exist between various educational institutions or between two professions that rub together the wrong way at times, much like alchemists and physicians. This rivalry, in a rather amusing paradox given how the two parties dislike each other, brings about an exchange of culture. Invariably, such a cultural exchange (the sort with a bit of acid between the two parties) brings about those individuals who attempt to bridge the gap between the two by embracing the tenants of both at once. These are the mechromancers, tinkers who have delved deeply enough into the necromantic arts to command both a squadron of mechanical minions and a squadron of undead minions. As they progress down this path, the line between machine and corpse blurs until it finally becomes one, at which point the two camps whose views they were attempting to integrate invariably agree that the mixture of the two concepts is an abomination and the mechromancer must be banished.<br/><br/>The mechromancer is a mixture of spellcaster and tinker. Requiring both the alpha and the animate dead spell to qualify, among other, lesser requirements, the mechromancer fills the role that the mystic theurge does for conventional casters: useful abilities piled onto full progression in both of your esoteric arts. Unlike the mystic theurge, the mechromancer is only a 5 level prestige class. Also, given magic and tinkering tends to mesh less well than magic and more magic, the class has a glut of small, useful abilities to help blend the two ideas together in a logical fashion.<br/><br/>The Mechromancer at a glance:<br/><br/>     Full spell and invention progression<br/>     The Blue Screen of Undeath ability, which allows the mechromancer to raise fallen automatons as &quot;zombie robots&quot;<br/>     Mechromantic Grafts, which allows the mechromancer to add dead tissue to each of his blueprints for some rather potent benefits<br/>     Beacon of Undeath, which causes the mechromancer's alpha to emit a permanent desecrate effect, and eventually some benefits of the unhallow spell<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "144002": {"rpg": {"9041": "Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Watchful Gaze", "rpgproducer": {"31284": "Kristen M.

The overall goal of the expansion is to inject a heavy dose of historical theme into the Dark Horse game as well as offer additional game play options.<br/><br/>The expansion introduces the concept of players having a specific Reputation. This is done through various game mechanics and cards by offering two distinct options based on Reputation tokens, i.e., White Hat or Black Hat. The Wild West was characterized by famous heroes, villains, lawmen and outlaws. Players will now be able to choose a side and hire either classic White Hat or Black Hat type characters. The good guys, called Rebels, have abilities that assist players in accomplishing goals. The bad guys, called Rogues, can harass opponents and even rob from them. Players can opt to exclude Rogues or add in a variant that allows characters to initiate gunfights and capture Rogues.<br/><br/>Reputation adds in a thematic decision that can affect player&rsquo;s options in many of the expansion variants. For example, additional Action Cards will be introduced that will have two options on them. Players will only be able to select the option that corresponds to their Reputation. So, if a player chooses to side with Outlaws then they would only have access to &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; abilities.<br/><br/>The expansion will also offer players additional Action Cards, Player Characters, and Special Roles.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"211970": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.75758", "name": "Dark Horse: Rebels & Rogues", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "33", "expands": {"98443": {"name": "Dark Horse"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "144025": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Knights of the Dinner Table Magazine (Issue 195 - 2013)", "rpgproducer": {"6159": "Jolly R.

Simple to understand and great fun, Agricola lets everyone play to the end in a race to see who can build the most productive farm.<br/>Easy To Play!<br/><br/>Agricola is a turn-based game, played in six Stages and 14 Rounds. On a turn, players place a family member token on a location in town in order to collect resources or to take actions to improve their farm. They can get building materials such as wood and clay, plow fields and sow crops, or build fences to keep animals. New actions become available at the start each round and resources get replenished on any taken in the previous round.<br/><br/>At harvest crops are reaped, newborn animals arrive and you must feed your family. Growing your family gives you more actions but means you have more mouths to feed!<br/><br/>The player with the most productive and advanced farm at the end of 14 rounds is the winner. Victory Points are awarded for the number of fields and pastures you have, as well as for crops and animals. Additional points are awarded for extension and renovation of the family's home, for the number of family members, and for played Occupation and Improvement cards.

You can earn victory points with diplomatic actions, domestic politics, war movement, the actions of production, etc., and at the end of the game, the person with the highest score after the third era wins.<br/><br/>Because you can make combos with lots of features on historical cards and you can score in various ways, Patchistory will give you another new exciting play every time it hits the table.<br/><br/>&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;<br/><br/>\ud328\uce58\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\ud14c\ub9c8\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\ubcf4\ub4dc\uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc720\uad6c\ud55c \uc778\ub958\uc0ac\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc778 \uc601\uc6c5, \uae30\ub150\ube44\uc801\uc778 \uac74\ucd95\ubb3c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uce74\ub4dc\uac00 \uac01\uac01 1,2,3\uc2dc\ub300\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7f0 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uce74\ub4dc\ub4e4\uc744 \uacbd\ub9e4\ub85c \uac00\uc838\uc640 1\uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0\ub294 5*5, 2\uc2dc\ub300\ub294 6*6, 3\uc2dc\ub300\ub294 7*7 \uce78\uc758 \ubc94\uc704 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb9\uce58\uac8c \ubc30\uce58\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc2e0\ub9cc\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4 \uac11\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub807\uac8c \uc644\uc131\ub41c \uc790\uc2e0\ub9cc\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \uce74\ub4dc\ub4e4\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\ub4e4\uc774 \ubc1c\ub3d9\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uace0 \uc678\uad50, \ub0b4\uc815, \uc774\ub3d9 \uc804\uc7c1, \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ub4f1\ub4f1\uc758 \uc561\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc5bb\uac8c \ub418\ub294\ub370<br/>\uc774\ub54c 3\uc2dc\ub300\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc5bb\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \uc2b9\ub9ac\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.<br/><br/>\ud328\uce58\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub9e4\ub825\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uce74\ub4dc\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ub2a5\ub4e4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \ucf64\ubcf4\uac00 \ubc1c\ub3d9\ub418\uace0 \uadf8\ub85c\uc778\ud55c \uc810\uc218 \ud68d\ub4dd\ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uc5ec \uac8c\uc784 \ud560 \ub54c\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ub9e4\ubc88 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub97c \uc900\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"212001": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.3353", "name": "Patchistory", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1568", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"27646": "Tableau Building"}}, "144042": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Picross e2", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"212003": "Nintendo 3DS eShop edition"}, "average": "7", "videogameseries": {"22725": "Picross e"}, "videogametheme": {"2351": "Puzzle"}, "usersrated": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"5857": "Nintendo 3DS"}, "poll": {}, "description": "&quot;This is the sequel to 'Picross e' with a navigation feature to make gameplay even smoother.

The rules are simple and easy to understand. Anyone can do it!<br/><br/>The Navigation feature is a new feature that was first used in Picross e.

By narrowing the field down to the columns you need to pay attention to, you can now solve puzzles at a much smoother pace. There are 150 puzzles that can be enjoyed by novices and experts alike. There is even a completely new &quot;Micross&quot; mode for hours and hours of puzzling fun!<br/><br/>Micross puzzles are made up of 1 overall puzzle (8x8) and several detail puzzles (10x10). Once you have completed the overall puzzle (8x8), you will be able to enter the colored squares to solve the detail puzzles (10x10) inside, in order to create a more detailed picture. Once you've solved all the colored squares, you will have a large illustration of 80x80.<br/><br/>The micross puzzles in this game are themed after world-famous paintings.

You will also be able to use Super Famicom, Mega Drive, Game Boy Color and Game Boy cartridges as well. Because we have created a new chipset, it allows us to ensure that region locks and compatibility are no longer an issue, and the RetroN 5 will play both PAL and NTSC cartridges. CIC lockout chips and FX chips are no longer going to be an issue, as we aim to achieve 100% compatibility with all cartridges.<br/><br/>On the front of the console, there is a power button to turn on the console, and adjacent to this button, is a sync button. This button will allow you to sync up to 4 wireless controllers to one console, allowing you to play multiplayer compatible titles without the use of a multitap.<br/><br/>On the back of the console, will be a standard AV output, a USB port to allow for charging of the wireless controller, an AC Adapter to power up the system, and a HDMI output for HDTV connectivity.<br/><br/>Along the sides of the console, are controller ports for the SNES, Genesis, and NES, totalling 6 controller ports, allowing for users to use their original controllers. Users will also be able to use any controller they desire for any system. That means, if you want use a SNES controller to play Genesis games, the RetroN 5 will allow you to do so.<br/><br/>The RetroN 5 will come with a wireless controller that utilizes Bluetooth technology, allowing for a playable distance of a minimum of 15 feet without losing sync from the console. This new controller will also have a Microswitch Directional Pad instead of a traditional directional pad. Along with 6 face buttons, two shoulder buttons, a start and select button, and 4 LED light indicators to display the player number, there is also a Home button that will serve multiple functions; one is to sync the controller to the console, but to also gain access to the Game User Interface (GUI) at any point during gameplay. There are also two Macro buttons that will allow you to program. Every controller will have a rechargeable lithium ion battery than can be charged through any USB port via the micro USB cable.<br/><br/>When you power on the RetroN 5 for the first time, you will notice, that the user will be taken to a digital user interface. We have created a new system menu that will allow for users to select which system they would like to play, as well as access features that we felt were important to gamers.<br/><br/>Most games did not allow for you to freely save your games. The RetroN 5 will allow you to save their games at any point during gameplay, and will feature an autosave feature upon shutdown. You will be able to load your saves at anytime during gameplay.<br/><br/>The RetroN 5 will up convert the video signal to show clearer and cleaner images, with vibrant colors on an HDTV with a resolution output of up to 720p through the use of shaders. You will also be able to select the aspect ratio in our GUI, from the standard 4:3 to the HD ratio of 16:9. Our goal is to fill up as much of the screen as possible.<br/><br/>Overall audio output quality will be improved through the utilization of audio interpolation, a method of making digital sound better than it really is, resulting in a smoother, cleaner audio output. As a sound wave enters an ADC (analog to digital converter), samples are taken at timed intervals. Higher sample rates produce better recordings, but also require the use of more memory. As a result, to conserve space, most developers used sound that was of lower quality. What interpolation does is instead of repeating each low quality sample, it creates new samples between the originals. As a result, it creates a smoother, crisper sound output than the original sound.<br/><br/>Users will be able to program the controller to assign buttons to their preference. In turn, the RetroN 5 will save these custom layouts, so that users will not have to constantly reconfigure the button configuration. This feature will also be available to people wanting to remap their buttons on their original controllers.<br/><br/>The RetroN 5 will allow for manual and passive overclocking, giving the users the ability to speed up or slow down their games as they see fit. This option will be available on our GUI, and users will have the ability to access this at any time during gameplay by utilizing the 'Home' button on the controller.

Designed to fill in the gaps during the early journeys of the Far East Adventure Path, this adventure delivers clever combats, negotiation and investigation, a delightful mix of urban and wilderness adventure possibilities, and roleplaying possibilities aplenty. Perhaps even more so than other Adventure Path Plug-Ins, Road to Destiny ably stands on its own as a self-contained micro-campaign, but it can provide equal richness and excitement in any campaign. Legendary Games combines stellar writing talent with innovative layout and product design and top-notch artistic values that we think will bring you back again and again, and we think that Road to Destiny will absolutely help Make Your Game Legendary!<br/><br/>"}, "144098": {"statistics": {}, "name": "League of Evil 2", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"212124": "iPhone/iPad edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"22730": "League of Evil"}, "videogametheme": {"2287": "Superhero"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "description": "ABOUT<br/>League of Evil 2 is the sequel for the award winning original, League of Evil, which came out February 3, 2011.

Once you get the chance to tap on the amazing 3D weapon models and toy with them, you will know what we mean. There are already over 30 beautifully rendered weapons and there will be more!<br/><br/>NEW GAME MECHANICS<br/>Our fans and players of Overkill have always asked for health and armor upgrades. At Craneballs we listen and we deliver. Introducing combat equipment and armor and health boosting tactical items.<br/><br/>NEW UNITS<br/>Of course all units in Overkill 2 are new. Strictly speaking though, we've introduced a completely new type of unit. Be ready to face the grenadiers! You are no longer the only one who can throw stun and flash grenades. Plus there are also the high explosive grenades falling on your head. Grenades can be shot midair, which adds yet another challenge to test how quick your reflexes truly are.<br/><br/>THE GRAPHICS<br/>Gameplay is always the key component to any successful game. We know that very well. But we also know that when you add graphics that are pleasure to look at, you improve the gameplay experience by thousands. Which is exactly what we did. Attention to the very last detail is what makes our games different.

Its concept is a heavy departure from other installments in the Final Fantasy series, providing a darker and more realistic atmosphere that focuses on human emotions and believable characters. The game features expansive environments and a seamless and customizable battle system, which gives players great freedom regarding their preferred play method.<br/><br/>The story is based on the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythology, but has no direct relation to the other games in this series as it features a unique world, visual design and different characters. Its main protagonist, Noctis, is the prince of a mafia-like royal family which protects the last remaining crystal in the world and rules over a technologically advanced city-state. The plot centers on the invasion of a medieval war nation that tries to conquer the crystal. During the course of the game, Noctis meets the aristocratic and kind Stella who shares his ability of seeing a mysterious 'light' connected to a goddess of the dead.<br/><br/>Final Fantasy XV started production shortly before its announcement in May 2006, when it was initially unveiled under the title Final Fantasy Versus XIII (\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30b5\u30b9XIII Verusasu S\u0101t\u012bn) alongside Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Agito XIII (which was later renamed to Final Fantasy Type-0). The game's long development time and absence from the public eye gave rise to several rumors concerning its possible cancellation or shift to another platform. In June 2013, it was eventually revealed to have been renamed and switched systems from PlayStation 3 to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Final Fantasy XV is being developed by a team within Square Enix's 1st Production Department and directed by Tetsuya Nomura, who also designed the characters and conceived the concept and base story.<br/><br/>Final Fantasy XV is an action role-playing game with third-person shooter elements. The player character is seen from a third-person perspective that will be adjusted depending on the weapon currently equipped. The game's environments among others include kingdoms and villages and allow for much freedom and interactivity: for example, objects can be destroyed and different paths may be chosen to reach a destination. The world map is a wide, open field that the player can traverse on foot or by using a car, an airship or a chocobo. A day-and-night time system affects the appearance of monsters on the world map. Final Fantasy XV uses interactive cutscenes in the form of real-time events. The player keeps control during them as the gameplay is not interrupted, which will result in natural progressions and storytelling that is similar to that of first-person shooters. However, the game also features uncontrollable pre-rendered full motion videos (FMVs) for scenes in which player control would have little effect. The ratio of real-time event scenes and pre-rendered FMVs is 7:3.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "144122": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2282": {"name": "Robert G.

The map is a point-to-point map, using city-states and the common land and navigable sea routes as the conduits that defined the Grecian Mediterranean. The game is designed for simple movement and combat mechanics to resolve battles and sieges, all centered upon the predominance of famous and historic leaders (e.g., Alcibiades). The game is richly historic, and keeps players within historic parameters in such a way that alliances and politics can shift, depending on how the war is going, but only within the limits of historic possibilities. Some city-states of the Delos Confederation may ally with Athens, while others may ally with Sparta, for example. Athens vs Sparta includes four scenarios: The Archidamian War (431 - 422), The Peace of Nicias and the Sicilian Expedition (421 &ndash; 413), The Ionian War (412 &ndash; 404), and the campaign scenario covering the entire war.<br/><br/>The game includes one 22x34&quot; map of the Grecian Mediterranean, including Sicily and southern Italy, and as far east as the Persian empire, 280 counters of all participants in the Peloponnesian War. Each game turn is played as four seasons of one year. Each inch equals ~18 miles. One naval strength point represents 5 galleys of the era (Triremes), and one land strength point represents 350 to 450 heavy infantry (Hoplites) or 500 to 600 light infantry or 200 to 300 cavalry.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"212205": "First edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Sparta versus Athens", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "average": "5.365", "usersrated": "20", "boardgamefamily": {"18614": "Cities: Athens"}}, "144136": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Elysium-TCG", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"212206": "iPhone edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1695511.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2403": "Board Game"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4443": "iPhone"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1695511_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Elysium-TCG is a digital trading card game that offers single player mode as well as online and local bluetooth play.<br/><br/>"}, "144137": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Might & Magic: Duel of Champions", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"212208": "iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1710250.png", "videogametheme": {"2403": "Board Game"}, "usersrated": "9", "average": "7.27778", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1710250_t.png", "description": "Might &amp; Magic Duel of Champions is a free To play online card game set in the fantastic Might &amp; Magic universe.

Set in the fascinating and disturbing world of Zenozoik, the first game put you in the role of Ghat, a man whose defiance of his clan&rsquo;s leader and progenitor, &lsquo;FatherMother&rsquo;, tore their family apart.<br/><br/>Despite events that forced him to leave his home, Ghat never intended to reveal FatherMother&rsquo;s dark secret, the reason for his defiance. However, after deciding to return with a mysterious being he&rsquo;d met in his exile that called himself &lsquo;Golem&rsquo;, the secret came out. FatherMother was incarcerated and the clan went their separate ways.<br/><br/>Now, with FatherMother jailed and the family dissolved, the world of Zenozoik faces new hardships. Nobody knows why the Golem has decided to stay in Zenozoik, yet his power and knowledge are undeniable. Ghat finds this outsider&rsquo;s imposition upon his home unacceptable, and wants to rid Zenozoik of his influence. Rimat simply wants the family to be reunited, but feels that Ghat is the only one she can turn to. The two form an uneasy alliance and embark upon a journey to change the future of Zenozoik.<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/><br/>A surreal world to explore:<br/>The world of Zenozoik has been lovingly rendered with the Unreal III engine, allowing the madmen of ACE Team to fully capture the beauty of Zenozoik as it exists in their imagination.

Fans of Axis Empires: Totaler Krieg and Axis Empires: Dai Senso will want to get this &ndash; it&rsquo;s a big, big package designed to add even more enjoyment to our popular series of World War II grand strategy games. The AE Expansion Kit includes three parts. First, there&rsquo;s Schiffskrieg, the air-and-naval expansion that provides additional detail for players who want more from the game beyond its abstract support units. Now players must base their air assets and ships (down to the cruiser level) on the map and move them to respond to threats. Air-naval combat, commerce raiding, anti-submarine warfare and naval construction are all accounted for while preserving that Krieg design elegance you know and love.<br/><br/>Second, there&rsquo;s Dice of Decision II, a much-expanded update to the Random Campaign Generator featured in Totaler Krieg! As before, you&rsquo;ll be able to create new, very different Second World Wars based on alt-history paths from the Great War and the 1920s and &lsquo;30s: What if the Tsar still ruled Russia? What if Germany had won the war in 1917? What if there hadn&rsquo;t been a Great Depression? New for DoD II is everything related to Asia and the Pacific &ndash; now you&rsquo;ll be able to explore alternate Pacific Wars: What if there were no Washington Naval Treaty? What if Japan&rsquo;s 1931 involvement in Manchuria had unfolded differently? What if Gandhi had gained independence for India? Naturally, your alt-hist Europe and Pacific games will still link to tell a completely original Global War story.<br/><br/>Finally, there&rsquo;s the TK &amp; DS Upgrade: everything you need to update your existing Axis Empires games to true &ldquo;second edition&rdquo; status without requiring you to buy whole new copies. The Upgrade incorporates six years of additional design, development and research since the 2011 publication of TK and DS. It also includes new optional rules and scenarios that had to be cut from those games for space reasons. Now you can play out that East vs. West &ldquo;Separate Peace&rdquo; scenarios and spring unexpected surprises on your opponents with &ldquo;Fortunes of War&rdquo; cards!

While there are districts wher law and order hold sway, no single force exercises control over the whole city and outside its walls there is near anarchy to the West, while Taskan soldiers maintain some order in the East to keep the road to the imperial heartlands open.<br/><br/>Sorandib has been kept alive by two things: its control over the trade in Fengo, a drug harvested from the weeds that choke lake Barur to the North; and the creations of the Guild of Artificers, a centuries-old association of sorcerer-scientists who are famous for their inventions, feats of engineering and practical devices &ndash; many of which are built into the very fabric of the city.<br/><br/>Just as the Emperor owes his immortality to magic provided by the king of Sorandib, the city will surely play a role in his final ascension to the heavens. The cult of Thesh in Taskay has its eye on direct control not only of the Artificers but of the fire-demon Sorantar who is the city&rsquo;s god. The Iron Simulacrum himself looks to Sorandib as the place he will discover his fate when the Emperor departs the physical plane, where he might be unmade in such a way as to find the key to a continued existence as an independent soul. Sorandib could be the scene of Treason on a world-shattering scale.<br/><br/>Age of Treason: The Iron Companion provides a comprehensive view of this famous city, including maps, floor plans, NPCs, cults, scenarios and rules for creating Artifice.<br/><br/>Also in this book are new spells, price lists, new rules for training, henchmen and hirelings, running a business and using Passion traits in the setting. Comprehensive Spirit Magic rules synthesise the Legend rules and the Setting rules into a single document, and statistics are provided for Elementals, including the bizarre Flesh Elemental, the Blemmye.<br/><br/>In addition to the fully detailed scenarios set in Sorandib, the Companion describes six major treasonous plots to form the backdrop for further adventures, as well as suggested plotlines for scenarios set on the wild frontiers of Marangia and Kitan.<br/><br/>"}, "144196": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Jack and the Beanstalk", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"212333": "English/European Amstrad CPC edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2335": "Fairy Tale"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"5203": "Amstrad CPC"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"144289": "Soft Aid"}, "description": "From the inlay (Soft Aid compilation):<br/><br/>As Jack you have to search for the castle's riches, being careful not to wake the giant sleeping in the parlour.

The remaining cards form a draw pile. The dealer turns cards over from the draw pile until s/he reaches a &quot;situation&quot; card. (Others are mixed back into the pile.)<br/><br/>The dealer announces the situation and the youngest player (presumably to help children learn politeness and pragmatics starting at a young age) figures out whether s/he has the appropriate response card. If so, s/he says so and takes the situation card as a matched pair with his/her response card.<br/><br/>Else, the player takes a draw card and further, the game's rules require the child state, &quot;Now you try, please&quot; and the next player or opponent to respond, &quot;Thank you&quot; as an additional method of reinforcing politeness. If the next player has the corresponding response card, s/he may claim the pair. Otherwise, s/he draws a card and play continues so on and so forth.<br/><br/>If a player is able to match a response card to a situation card, s/he become dealer.

Torn by destructive chaos and strife, it was completely devoid of any creative powers and life . Nothing could exist in this Disharmonious Void. It was death for the dead in essence and completely uninspired. A spark of Inspiration or Awen, called the Great Spark, blazing red and shaped like a thunder-bolt, tore its way through the blackness with fury. The Fire of Creation split the shapeless Void into the (as yet empty) Three Circles (Tr&iacute; F&aacute;ine) that were anchored around one magnificent, growing oak tree.

Each challenge consists of a parcours built out of the wooden blocks according to the challenge card you draw randomly from three piles: A - C, from easy to difficult. After having built the landscape course, you have to push, pull, lift, slide or swing the &quot;trapper&quot; from the start to the end block. This trapper has a metal eye on top, and you move it with a wooden rod with a hook at its end. Some challenges require an intermediate string between rod and pawn, while others require both hands to simultaneously move pawn and grizzly bear, the bear being another wooden piece. A third kind of piece to be moved is provisions, which you &quot;kick&quot; with the trapper.<br/><br/>When you master the challenge, the next player decides whether to change to the next parcours or try to master the same one again. Depending on the difficulty of the challenge, your piece can move 2-4 steps toward the summit.

Each player has two types of Counters: Hexagonal and Circular. Hexagonal counters can move in 3 directions, while Circular counters can move in all 6 directions.<br/><br/>Each player tries to outmaneuver and eliminate all of the opposing player's pieces on the board. To do this, they can do one of three things on their turn. They can either: Move/Attack with a counter or stack of counters, prepare a stack of Hexagonal counters for an advanced move with changing directions, or &quot;Swytch&quot; (i.e., change the orientation of a Stack of Hexagonal counters, and thus what directions they can move).

In truth, the majority of the family sagas take place in the hundred years between 930 (the year of the first national assembly) and 1030.

Following the army build rules, each side can customize their force to suit their own strategy. They also control how the forces are deployed at the start of the game. The balancing factor is a victory point time limit and a growing defensive force. The attackers must move fast!<br/><br/>The 20&quot; X 30&quot; map depicts the United States and surrounding areas as it was around WW2. Areas are broken up into Land Territories, City Zones, Nuclear Research Sites, and Naval Landing Zones. The Allies must defend their 20 major Cities from Axis occupation in order to continue fielding their defensive forces. However, they must also keep the enemy from capturing the 2 research facilities across the U.S. so atomic research can be harnessed and Victory Points earned. Axis forces are tasked with simultaneously cutting off Allied supplies and capturing nuclear technology for themselves to crush the last remaining opposition to Axis world domination. By attacking America from both sides at once, coordination and decisive action is a must!<br/><br/>AMERIKA also introduces veteran game players to a variety of new units like jet fighters and self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, while keeping each unit type&rsquo;s rules easy enough for beginners to master. With just 8 unit types in the game, purchasing and combat move fast and are resolved simply using a battle board.

There&rsquo;s been at least one new Sentai series on Japanese television each and every year since the late 70s, and thanks to the success of the Power Rangers, similar shows have been a staple of American kid&rsquo;s television for two decades now.<br/><br/>Sentai adventures emphasize teamwork: an elite squad of 5-6 colorful, spandex-clad superheroes use phenomenal gadgets, martial arts talent and equally colorful giant robots to battle alien monsters the size of small office buildings. As a genre, Sentai is predicable and formulaic to a fault: each episode follows a similar pattern. The Sentai team investigates some crisis, fights some low level adversaries until the episode&rsquo;s real villain reveals itself. After battling the episode&rsquo;s mastermind to a standstill, the villain grows to enormous size thanks to vile magic or alien technology, and to finally destroy the villain, the heroes must do the same, activating their own mecha or tapping into size changing circuitry built into their costume.<br/><br/>Alone, you&rsquo;re powerful. You&rsquo;re a skilled martial artist wearing an armored body stocking capable of shrugging off small arms fire and backed by an array of crime fighting gadgets years more advanced than anything else on Earth.

Inside, you&rsquo;ll find details about the Galactic Legion, a sprawling armada of super powerful galactic guardians, and the artificial moon, now in orbit around the 35th Century Earth, they call home. You&rsquo;ll meet some new heroic races with their own unique gifts.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll also find a new selection of character options designed to emulate the thrills of DC Comic's long running Legion of Superheroes franchise: several new player races, new starting talents, new feats, new Powered Hero abilities and superpowers of all kinds, not to mention new weapons, equipment and starships. Finally, new threats and adventure ideas on entirely new planets and forgotten asteroid tombs challenge your galactic legionnaires.<br/><br/>"}, "144276": {"rpg": {"305": "d20 Modern"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Black Tokyo Unlimited: The Races of Black Japan", "rpgproducer": {"15781": "Christopher A.

In it, we choose a King, create a Kingdom to rule, then play out a series of scenes to discover what happens.<br/><br/>At the start of the game the King possesses three Regalia: a crown, castle, and sword, that give them authority over the characters, places, and threats in the kingdom. Like a Game Master in a traditional role-playing game, the king wields vast power over their Kingdom.<br/><br/>The rest of us play members of the Kings Court. We might begin as subservient nobles, losers, jocks, or lowly dish-dogs at a fast food restaurant, but through play, when we seize the King's Regalia, we seize the Narrative Authority that goes with it.

But when we were kids, we all tried to go around this rule by inventing our own hand symbols like Lightning, Bomb or Tank. Jak and Poi builds on this &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; concept and the result is an accessible one-card-per-turn game that has surprising depth and strategy.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to reduce your opponent&rsquo;s 20 life points to zero. To do this, each player uses the 2 main card types in the game: Jaks and Pois. The main mechanic of the game revolves around how these two card types interact with each other. Since Jaks (representing Rock, Paper, Scissors) can counter against or synergize with Pois (representing your lighting, bomb, tank, etc.) correctly anticipating your opponent&rsquo;s moves or leading your opponent to play in your favor is key to victory.<br/><br/>While unique, the gameplay of Jak and Poi is only half the reason the game is so special. Leveraging on the fact that every one of us, at some point in our childhood, invented our own hand symbols to try and win at Rock, Paper, Scissors, we crowdsourced the creation of all the cards in the game from players and artists who wanted to let their imaginations run wild.<br/><br/>The two decks in Jak and Poi&rsquo;s first release are the result of the efforts of 40+ designers and 20+ artists.

The symbols on the dice let you slide a row left or right one space, reroll your other dice, or move an unoccupied level to the top of the game board (effectively pushing players down). If you do jump or use a symbol, you can reroll the remaining dice to try to move again or you can stop where you are.<br/><br/>If you land on another Doodler, that player falls straight down. If you land on a power tile (which are not recommended for the first game), you acquire a propeller hat, shield, jetpack or jump shoes to use on a later turn; flip over a trampoline or springs, and you jump again immediately.

It's also illegal to form a crosscut, i.e. a 2x2 pattern of stones consisting of two diagonally adjacent Black stones and two diagonally adjacent White stones.<br/><br/>If a player can't make a move on his turn, he must pass.

With gun towers fixing their sights on the player's craft and platoons of enemy tanks and drones closing in, each round can determine if KOKUGA will complete its mission or if it will be engulfed in enemy fire.<br/>     Attack and support cards - In each stage, the player has access to a fixed set of 20 attack and support cards. Distributed at random, use the cards strategically to maximize your score, blast through tough enemy platoons, or assist another player in your squad.<br/>     Personalize your play time and degree of difficulty - Whether you want a quick run or a long challenger, players can easily tailor their game time in KOKUGA. For some fast action, clear a stage next to one of the finals and proceed directly to one of the main bosses. Or if you want to dig in for a lengthy session, work your way through several stages before facing off with a boss. Choose from 4 different difficulty levels as well.<br/>     Multiplayer modes - KOKUGA supports Local and Download Play, so assemble a squad of up to four players for some co-op gaming.

Play proceeds clockwise from a random start player.<br/>    All players start with a hand of five cards. Player 1 plays up to two cards, and then draws two cards, unless affected by cards or special abilities. Players may have no more than 10 cards in their hand. If, after drawing, you have more than ten cards, discard until you have only ten. If a player runs out of cards in their deck they shuffle their discarded cards and start the deck fresh. Play moves clockwise until the last planet is drawn. (Planets can only be drawn when Explorers are played.)

Each player will select a cycling team and take responsibility for managing the movements of 5-6 riders in their team. The aim of each team will be to secure victory at the end of each stage or in the general classification.<br/><br/>The course is built from hexagonal tiles.  Each hexagon tile is divided in turn into three spaces, with each space representing a kilometre of the race. Mountain sections, intermediate sprints and the finish line are shown using indicator tokens placed at the kilometre points agreed upon by the players at the beginning of the race.<br/><br/>This game comes in three versions: Junior, Senior and Master.  Each version builds on the rules of previous versions.   In the Junior version each rider is moved by rolling two six-sided dice.  Riders in a peloton (at least five riders in the same space) may choose not to roll and instead move five spaces.  A rider in the peloton may choose to roll in the hope of raising its pace or of breaking away (roll of 10-12).  The difficulty of the mountain sections is represented by rolling just one dice.  Each team has five water bottles that can be spent to move a rider an extra space (cost of one bottle on the flat, 2 bottles in mountains).  The rider furthest across the finish line at the end of a turn is the winner.<br/><br/>The Senior version introduces different categories of climb and gives each team member a role (climber, sprinter, rouleur, domestique (flat or mountain), and lantern rouge).  Each role has particular abilities.  Each team may launch one attack by rolling four dice instead of the normal two.  Falls, fast descents and falling back to join a team-mate are also represented.<br/><br/>The Master version makes use of software accessed through the publisher&rsquo;s website to enable whole tours to be run.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"212749": "First edition"}, "name": "Cycling Party", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "average": "6.89164", "usersrated": "67", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "144461": {"boardgamedesigner": {"69093": {"name": "Seb\u0109jo"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Kvaredroj", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3126660_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"69093": "Seb\u0109jo"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"772": {"name": "(Unpublished)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3126660.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"321119": "Esperanto edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "A 2 players abstract game that uses a bunch of d4. <br/>The goal is to capture the opponent's 4 target dice.<br/>The dice can move as many times as shown on their current position but one can chose to use one turn to change the value on one die instead of moving.<br/>Any captured non-target die is rerolled and replaced on the board, so placement and adjusting values is often a better option than attacking the opponent's dice.<br/><br/>"}, "144462": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1756099.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"69093": {"name": "Seb\u0109jo"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"22611": "Sir John Tenniel"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1756099_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "\u011caber\u016doko (Jabberwock) is a trick taking card game with an Alice in Wonderlands theme where players must fulfill different contracts (20 available), sometimes trying to take some specific cards, sometimes avoiding them.<br/>The game contains standard Ace-&gt;10 cards and three different Jabberwocks in each color.

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the war merged into the greater conflict of World War II as a major front of what is broadly known as the Pacific War. The Second Sino-Japanese War was the largest Asian war in the 20th century. It also made up more than 50% of the casualties in the Pacific War if the 1937&ndash;1941 period is taken into account.

Major battles and historical events are represented by event cards which may be executed chronologically as the history (see the Historical Game option in 17.0), or randomly so as to make youself unprepared for what will happen in the next turn. You have to use your limited resources (limited number of actions, and event cards beneficial to you) to avoid Japanese capture of your Capital, Chungking.

The difference is that each platform has a number, which is steadily increasing. Jumping on a platform reduces the number. If a disk is reduced to 0 (green) then it is safe and will no longer increase unless a neighbour explodes or Ron the Robot steps on it. If any of the discs reach the maximum number, they start to flash. If the player doesn't reach it in time it will explode and will then be shown with no number on it. Ron can be shot to remove him from the board for a time.

When the larvae hatch, they slowly eat their way out of the paralyzed hosts.

Not only do they have to maintain a handle on the stage they are setting, but they also have to keep things interesting. A lot of times a GM will look towards a pre-made adventure - many of which require players to do A then B then C to get D, etc. - to save some time in the game preparation. Just as many times, players will start at A then send their characters to X, destroy C, and then run away from D to get to M. All the GM's planning in the world cannot account for every action the players want their characters to take.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst situation in which a GM can find himself results when a player character (&quot;PC&quot;) is trying to have an unforseen conversation with a non-player character (&quot;NPC&quot;). For example, the Mayor that Dooley wants to meet. The GM could just ignore the player's request and say that the Mayor says nothing interesting. Another GM could use the Mayor to get the PC's back on track with the prepared adventure. A GM could take a break to flesh out the area the PC's want to explore.<br/><br/>This supplement attempts to help a GM create interesting NPC's on the fly so that if the third option is taken, the task is simpler and the results fun. Instead of just a stereotypical Mayor (whatever that may be), with a few die rolls a Mayor can be created with a history, motivations, and even a reason to speak with the PC's. The best part is that this supplement is universal. It was designed to work for every genre from fantasy to horror, space opera to post-apocalypse adventure.<br/><br/>"}, "144498": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1703132.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"8862": {"name": "Scott Caputo"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"12383": "Pier\u00f4"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11652": {"name": "Stronghold Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1703132_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "description": "The balance of power is shifting among the Order Of The Gods!<br/><br/><br/>     The goddess Freya can permanently increase the value of the other beings.<br/>     The resourceful Dwarf taps the power of neighboring gods.<br/>     The monstrous Niohoggr hoards extra benefits for anyone brave enough to defeat it.<br/>     And the swift flying Raven can score twice in the same turn!<br/><br/><br/>Play these new tiles with the V&ouml;lusp&aacute; base game, or blend tiles from the Order of the Gods expansion with tiles from the Saga of Edda expansion.
