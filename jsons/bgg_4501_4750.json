Obviously Max has a better chance to move, more often and further than the others creatures who share the green pip rolls.  On the other hand Max can only move forward, as well the players can opt to move their animals before or after Max.

In fact Max can end up between or even ahead of the other animals as they advance down the path together.  When Max reaches the base of the tree, he camps out and waits for the animals behind him, who will have to risk a final leap on and off Max's back to get to safety.

It included 20 players on each at-that-time current (1970 season) baseball team, presented on tri-fold color charts.  The following two years, they released new editions to cover the most recent season.  For 1972, they switched to teams of 25 players each, on double-sided color charts without folds.  In 1973, The game title was changed to Pennant Race and the team roster size was reduced to 19 or 20 players per team. The team charts were replaced by individual player cards on perforated sheets, with no color coding.<br/><br/>Also in 1972, Time released a set of 16 All-Time All-Star Team Charts (in the same style as that year's edition), for each of the original American League and National League franchises, each with the 25 &quot;best&quot; players from that team's long history. In 1973, the same All-Time charts were released in a separate All-Time All-Star Baseball game.  This product was popular among tabletop managers.<br/><br/>The All-Time All-Star game was then changed to an individual card format and retitled as Superstar Baseball.  This was later transferred to The Avalon Hill Game Co when they picked up the entire line of sports games from Time.  This also granted The Avalon Hill Game Co the right to use the words &quot;A Sports Illustrated Game&quot; on any The Avalon Hill Game Co sports product, even if it wasn't part of the original Time, Inc line of games, which led to some confusion for titles such as Baseball Strategy, Football Strategy, and Pro Golf.<br/><br/>Special dice with results ranging from 10 through 39 (often called 10-39 Dice, see How to make a set of SIBB dice -- A Tutorial) were required to play this game, and sister games in the original Sports Illustrated sports simulation line.<br/><br/>"}, "4643": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic276928.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1288": {"name": "Jens-Peter Schliemann"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": {"1425": {"name": "H.

Each player is handed a copy of the appropriate race form (which should be studied!). The eleven racehorses, which are numbered two through twelve, are randomized and are bought, one at a time, by the players in an open auction. Money spent in the auction will be brought back into the game during the third, fifth and eighth races.<br/><br/>Eight races make a complete game and each follows the same procedure. Each player, in turn, has the option to make as many bets as one wants but each bet is made &ldquo;across the board.&rdquo; All bets are made in 150-skin (the game&rsquo;s monetary unit) increments: 50 to win, 50 to place and 50 to show. After everyone has placed their bets, the money is divided as equally as possible into seven stacks.<br/><br/>After all bets have been placed, the race is run. A horse has completed a circuit of the track when five Xs have been placed next to it. Sometimes horses begin with some Xs and sometimes the favorites, horses 6, 7 and 8, need an extra X.<br/>When a player rolls the dice, that player may give the horse rolled an X and pass on the dice or give that horse a / (half-X) and roll again to that horse an X. When three horses have finished the race, the owner(s) of the winning horse and winning bettors are paid. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Across the Board features a pari-mutual betting system to mimic a real racetrack. There are no fixed odds.

The large box was nearly twice the area of a traditional AH box. Later the game came out in a traditional-size box.  A second edition with clarified rules was issued in 1974 with the same standard size box but thinner.<br/><br/>The rules are fairly straightforward.  The strategies are extremely deep. Stalingrad is by far the most thoroughly and deeply analyzed board war game.  Furthermore, the game preserves interest for players at a wide range of levels. Stalingrad is a good game to use to introduce players to hex-based war games.<br/><br/>Stalingrad uses a move-combat sequence, alternating between players.  There is limited advance  (one square) or retreat (two squares) after combat.  Units have one-square thick zones of control; movement directly from one square in the zone of control of a unit into an adjoining square of the zone of control of the same unit is not allowed.  Functional terrain includes swamp (one square per turn movement), mountains (one square per turn movement, defenders are doubled), major cities (defenders doubled), rivers (defenders behind rivers are doubled if attacked only across the river), railroads (ten square movement bonus, must be taken all at once), lakes (impassible).  Weather is good in summer, snow in winter, and governed by a table in the spring and fall.  Mud halves ground movement.  Snow halves ground and rail movement, and freezes (converts to clear terrain) some swamps, rivers, lakes, and oceans.  Combat is mandatory between units that are adjacent at the end of each turn, but the attacker chooses which units attack which other units, so long as all adjacent units are in some battle.  The classical Avalon Hill D6 table, with results such as D Elim, A Elim, etc is in use.  Germans have limited replacements; Russian replacement rates escalate as the game goes on.  The objective is to capture the opposition's key cities (for the Russians, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad) or to destroy the other side's army.  The Russian (implicit in rules) can also win by taking Helsinki, Warsaw, and Bucharest, and holding them for two complete turns, but I have never heard of this being done between normal players.<br/><br/>Several extremely bad German strategic plans are in wide use.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"31454": "Avalon Hill First Edition (with trays)"}, "name": "Stalingrad", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "average": "5.91091", "usersrated": "385", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"11966": "Country: Russia"}}, "4652": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "1.5", "poll": {}, "name": "Drug Attack", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2028": "Role Playing"}, "yearpublished": "1971", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15064_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"377": {"name": "Dynamic Games / Dynamic Design Industries"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15064.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"155021": "Dynamic First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Drug Attack<br/>Springboard to Family Communications<br/>An informative game on drug abuse<br/><br/>Something unseen is happening in your community now!

Knock your opponents dice out of play in the basic game, or develop unique combinations to expel dicers to the dungeon in the advanced game. For ages 5 years and over.&quot;<br/><br/>The dicers game is played with collectible dice. These have 5 clear sides, with a figure representing the character inside of the dice. The sixth side is solid, and shows the name of the die, its &quot;casting number&quot;, its special ability, and its affiliations. The clear sides are numbered from 1 to 5, while the solid face is the '6'. Each die represents a character or item from the Harry Potter stories.<br/><br/>The starter set includes 6 dice; Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, Hagrid, and the Sorting Hat. It also includes a sheet of rules.<br/>The rules actually have 3 levels of play described in them. The basic game only uses the casting numbers on the dice. The Intermediate game adds in the abilities of the dice, and different areas of play, and the advanced game adds in the affiliations of the dice, and reserve abilities.<br/><br/>In the basic game, players set out the six dice and each take turns picking one to determine which dice they will use. Players then roll to see who goes first (the &quot;Challenger&quot;).<br/>The challenger picks one die, and then the defender picks on of their dice.<br/>The challenger may roll the die a number of times up to its Casting number, looking for as high a roll as possible. Only the last roll made counts, even if it is lower than a previous roll.<br/>The defender does the same with his or her die.<br/>The lower roll is expelled (removed from play) and the winner becomes the new challenger. This is repeated until only one player has dice left.<br/><br/>In the Intermediate game, there are three areas of play. All dice begin in the Field. A losing die is placed in the dungeon, where it cannot be used. A winning die is placed in the Keep. Dice in the keep cannot be used until a player has no dice left in the field, at which point all of the dice in that player's Keep are moved into the Field. The winning die can choose to either expel the losing die to the dungeon, or to just place it in the Keep and activate the special ability of the winning die. One side of the rules lists the different special abilities. A few examples include:<br/>Capture, which lets you take the enemy die and use its special powers as well as your own.<br/>Summon, which lets you retrieve a die that has been placed in the dungeon.<br/>Swap, which lets you trade the locations of two of a player's dice.<br/>The game ends when one player's dice are all in the dungeon or captured.<br/><br/>In the Advanced game, you can use the affiliations on the dice. The affiliations include the four houses, creatures, and wizards. For every die with the same affiliation as your chosen die in your Field, your die gains +1 to its casting number. This level of the game also adds reserve abilities. These are special powers that, when activated, have no immediate effect but allow the die to be set aside in 'Reserve' and activated later.<br/><br/>Extra dice are sold as single dice. The die you are buying is clearly displayed on the outside of the packaging.<br/><br/>The packaging stated that there were &quot;54 characters to collect&quot; but only 36 were released.<br/><br/>There were two 'Starter Packs' with 6 dice each and 24 individual dicers.<br/><br/>"}, "4670": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Proclaim!", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2002", "usersrated": "10", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic120529_t.jpg", "average": "6.8", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1099": {"name": "Lunch Table Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic120529.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Players take turns giving clues to their fellow participants.

The more people that guess the correct Proclaim! word, the fewer points that are awarded to each person, so clues must be clever enough to lead players to different possible answers to maximize their score. Creative, tricky ambiguity is the key to the game. Both the clue giver and guessing players have additional opportunities for extra points. For example, if a guessing player is certain they know the Proclaim! word, they yell &ldquo;Proclaim!&rdquo;, and roll the dice to determine the number of points to move forward for a correct guess, or backward for an incorrect guess. Also, the clue giver earns a &quot;unique&quot; bonus if the guessing players each give a different answer.

The Pawns start at the bottom-most spaces on the board and try to move up to the large, central top-most space: THE PIEDESTAL. Meanwhile, the Knights guard the PIEDESTAL and try to remove the Pawns from the game before they can reach the PIEDESTAL.<br/><br/>The Pawns win the game if five of them reach the PIEDESTAL, otherwise the Knights win.<br/><br/>SETUP: The twelve Pawns are placed three to a corner on the three lowest level spaces in each corner. The eight Knights are placed next to the PIEDESTAL, on all eight of the second-highest spaces on the board.<br/><br/>MOVE: A Pawn can move to a space on the next higher level directly beside it. Or it can move any number of spaces around the same level, unless blocked by another Pawn or Knight. The Knights can move the same way, with the additional advantage of moving either to a lower or higher level.<br/><br/>CAPTURING: During his turn, if a player is able to capture an opponent's piece, he must do so instead of making an ordinary move. To make a capture, the player moves his piece onto his opponent's space, and removes the opponent's piece from the board. A Pawn is able to capture a knight only if the Knight is one level higher than the Pawn, and directly beside the Pawn. A Knight is able to capture a Pawn only if the two pieces are on the same level, and directly beside one another.

Originally released in limited quantities by Ragnar Brothers of the UK, Angola quickly became a rare and highly sought after game of almost cult status. Why? Angola features a number of innovative game systems that keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution. MMP is now updating this classic with the fabulous graphics of the IGS line of games and bringing it to a wider audiences.<br/><br/>The map is divided into areas, and units represent military formations and also special weapons, such as artillery, rockets, tanks, and airplanes. A unique command and activation system has players committing in secret to the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is like a tense game of poker, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies.<br/><br/>The game is finely balanced, and all players frequently feel as if they are simultaneously on the verge of victory or defeat thanks to an ingenious victory point system that rewards good play for both sides and allows players to absorb reversals and strike back with the right countermove.<br/><br/>Angola contains:<br/>    2 decks of cards (110 total)<br/>    32 page full-color rulebook<br/>    2 player aid cards<br/>    22&quot; by 34&quot; inch map <br/>    3 countersheets <br/>    4 six-sided dice<br/><br/>Developer: Adam Starkweather<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"154664": "Multi-Man Publishing edition"}, "average": "7.99305", "name": "Angola", "playingtime": "480", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "331", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"27518": "Country: Angola"}}, "4689": {"boardgamedesigner": {"24": {"name": "Alex Randolph"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Parallelslalom", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15424_t.jpg", "average": "4.18571", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"834": {"name": "RAK Graphics"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic15424.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"184568": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "2 players try to get &quot;downhill&quot; first.

It was later published by Milton Bradley as part of their &quot;Life of the Pary&quot; line in 1987.<br/><br/>Episode: Mystery of the Mislaid Egg<br/><br/>Faberge: The Man and the Egg <br/>Peter Carl Faberge was born in 1846 and died in 1920. The Russian achieved fame by designing dazzling fantasies in gold and silver, set with precious stones and further decorated with brilliant enamel work. After winning a medal at the Pan-Russian Exhibition in 1882, his work attracted the attention of the Tsar. This ultimately led to the creation of the series of Imperial Easter Eggs. Faberge's eggs were first commissioned in 1886 by Tsar Alexander III, for his wife, Maria Feodorovna. The tradition continued with Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra.<br/><br/>The Plot: Imperial Russia is about to collapse. Members of the Pahlov family, cousins of the Tsar, are clinging to the tattered shreds of Imperial privilege. Shortly after the Peasant Circus celebration, the family's prized Imperial Faberge Easter Egg was discovered missing. The family regards the egg as a symbol of legitimacy and social status.<br/><br/>The Time: March 1917<br/><br/>The Place: Petrograd, Russia<br/><br/>The Cast:<br/><br/>Vladimir Pahlov: Head of the House of Pahlov and disgraced military leader. Vladimir led 300,000 men during the Battle of East Prussia in 1915, but couldn't find a fourth for a game of bridge when it was over. He currently courts peasant girls and designs Petrograd's defense for the impending Red invasion.<br/><br/>Natasha Pahlov: Wildly eccentric grand dame of the House of Pahlov, wife of Vladimir, and possessor of the largest shoe collection in Mother Russia. Natasha believes that the shoes vie for social position and partake in scandalous gossip. As a result, the footwear is constantly monitored and rearranged in the Imperial Shoe Chamber.<br/><br/>Lord Peter Welthrop: Natasha's half-brother and second cousin. Welthrop has lived in the House of Pahlov for the past six months. A native of London, he fled to Russia after running his father's bank into the ground. Destitute and confused, Peter spends most of his time in the Imperial Sable Yard, poking the animals with sticks and watching them bare their teeth.<br/><br/>Ludwina Pahlov: Beautiful and manipulative daughter of Vladimir and Natasha. Ludwina has persuaded the family to adhere to the practice of Khlysty (Flagellants). Flagellants believe that a person must sin and repent before he or she can become closer to God. This belief inspired the Pahlov family tradition of the Peasant Circus. This bimonthly event calls for the humiliation of invited peasant &quot;guests&quot;.<br/><br/>Grigory Yamovich: Disheveled yet hypnotic mystic. Invited home by the adoring Ludwina, Grigory became the guest who wouldn't go away. Besides indoctrinating Ludwina with the nuances of Khlysty, he ensured his &quot;usefulness&quot; within the House of Pahlov by seemingly curing sickly sables through hypnotism.<br/><br/>Zudnyet the Dung Hauler: Preferred peasant of Natasha. Zudnyet is keeper of the Imperial Compost Pile and overseer of the Imperial Beet Patch. He invariably sits beside Natasha during the Peasant Circus celebrations, clad in sable furs. Zudnyet is often summoned to Natasha's chambers for late-night discourses concerning man and God.<br/><br/>Olga Grimach: Lady-in waiting to Natasha and a woman of true inner strength. Most of Olga's time is spent as shoe organizer for Natasha's sometimes &quot;animated&quot; footwear collection. When not soothing soles, Olga writes eternally senseless poetry for a lover no one has ever seen.<br/><br/>Tatiana Mikhapolov: Sister of Vladimir and chief rival of Grigory. Tatiana is constantly trying to drive Grigory from the House of Pahlov in hopes of curbing the family's slide into a moral abyss. She poisoned his tea, dropped glowing embers in his shorts, and pushed him out a third story window-all to no avail.

It seems she became involved with some interesting characters who frequented a run-down bar in Havana called the Passion Cabana. Upon her return to Philadelphia, she promptly withdrew $1 million from her bank account. She was accompanied by a rather disheveled young man, possibly of Cuban descent. Her anxious family has not seen or heard from her since.<br/><br/>The Time: May 8, 1943.<br/><br/>The Place: The Passion Cabana in Havana<br/><br/>Max Hammond: A 35-year-old man who came to Havana in 1940. He is the owner of the Passion Cabana and has a black belt in karate. The funds he used to purchase the club supposedly came from the proceeds earned form twelve years of bounty hunting in the States. While rumors link Hammond romantically with every woman who ever crosses his path, he actually lives alone with a parrot and a motorcycle which hasn't run in two years.<br/><br/>Harlan Standard: An expatriated American author of some of the most controversial fiction of the '30's. Standard came to Havana to escape the constraints placed on him by his sexual and political leanings. A New York book reviewer slammed his latest book by saying, &quot;Who wants to read drivel penned by a man whose heart lies in Stalin's boudoir?&quot; Standard lives at his Aunt Edith's compound under her iron-fisted rule.<br/><br/>Mama Lisa: The gregarious madam of the largest house of ill repute in Havana. On the streets, Mama Lisa is known as an angel of mercy to her girls and the island's most vengeful practitioner of voodoo to her enemies.<br/><br/>General Luis Beltro: The brutal leader of Havana's provincial militia who refers to himself as Luis the Eraser. He has gone on a one-man crusade of late, driving most gambling and prostitution operations out of Havana. Beltro is catching heat from his superiors. They feel he should spend more time dealing with the growing bands of communist rebels which ring the outskirts of Havana.<br/><br/>Maria Solez: Smoldering, black-eyed beauty who is Max's closest advisor and night bartender at the Passion Cabana. Maria is rumored to be the only person on the island &quot;woman enough&quot; to tame Max Hammond's amorous urges.<br/><br/>Edith Pitvay: The youngish dowager of Cecil Pitvay, the late sugar cane magnate. Edith owns a large compound on the beach which has been a refuge for struggling artists and site of some of Havana's more decadent parties. Rumors of a &quot;chamber of horrors&quot; on the compound have never been substantiated, however.<br/><br/>Marylin Desmond: A seemingly permanent fixture at the Cabana. Marylin is renowned for her ability to consume enormous amounts of rum. Despite the amount of time she spends at the place, this well-dressed and well-spoken woman has managed to keep almost everything about herself a secret.<br/><br/>Reggie Van Peller: The fianc&eacute; in search of his beloved Katherine. A product of all the best schools, Van Peller was exempted from military service because of a large monetary donation to a member of the local draft board.

Now and then, they would ascend to the top of their towers, and, just for the fun of it, would spit out dice in all directions out over the surrounding lands. As a result, it wasn&rsquo;t long before they were known far and wide as the Dicemouths.<br/><br/>However, one day the rain of fried dice dried up, and the Dicemouths got extremely hungry.  But they remembered all the dice that they&rsquo;d spat out in the older, better, times.  Looking around, they found that many of them had developed into full grown dice trees, covered in fresh ripe fried dice.  But when the dicemouths tried to leave their towers to pick the dice, they found that they&rsquo;d got so fat that they couldn&rsquo;t get out through the doors.  They were trapped in their own towers.<br/><br/>But just before it was too late, one of the dicemouths, who&rsquo;d saved a few dice in his tower, had a brilliant idea.  He spat out a die, just as they had always done, but this time, as the die shot out from the tower, he kept tight hold of it, and he and his tower were dragged along behind the flying die.  In this way, he managed to reach the dice trees, picked their fruit, and passed them on to all his friends, saving the race of dicemouths.<br/><br/>Soon, all the dicemouths were able to travel this way.

Early iterations of the game included cards with attached objects, and cards of a variety of sizes and shapes within the same deck and gameplay session. Many cards in later decks have a point value, but this is by no means a requirement.<br/><br/>Cards generally include hand-drawn pictures.

Card illustrations can represent anything the designer wants to feature, from serious to absurd.

In other variants, players seed an otherwise blank deck with their own invented cards, which are shuffled in with blank cards to form a deck of about 60-90 cards. In this latter variant, a player may only craft a new card if he or she draws one of the blank cards during the course of play.<br/><br/>In most cases, unless countermanded or constrained by rules created during gameplay, players may play a card on themselves, on another player, or on all players. Card rules and actions may counter other cards which have already been played.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck is exhausted. Points may be tabulated and a winner declared. In some variants, players may then lay out all of the cards face-up for the &quot;epilogue&quot;, which allows players to choose the best cards to seed the deck for the next game.

Each player has 15 identical pieces that are set up on opposite sides of the board, which is comprised of an 8 x 8 playing field of squares that is further divided diagonally in alternate fashion (see picture). Pieces are comprised of: 8 small triangles of various orientation (Auxiliaries), 4 squares (Archers), which are the size of two Auxiliaries, 2 Hoplites (which are the size of an Archer with a Auxiliary on top), and 1 Syntagma, a larger triangle (the size of 2 Auxiliaries combined). Since each piece must always be oriented to face it's owner (diagram for set-up is printed on the board), you'll find that some pieces are not interchangeable with others of the same type (like Hoplites and Auxiliaries). This is important as all movement is done by moving pieces diagonally, horizontally or vertically along paths that are not blocked and the piece must end on a space where the board outline matches his piece.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture or &quot;Phalanx&quot; your opponents pieces - not by jumping (Checkers) or by taking it's place on the board (Chess), but by surrounding it on two of it's sides with your pieces. A multiple Phalanx attack is possible if a move surrounds several of his opponents pieces with a single move. When 14 of a players 15 pieces are captured, that player can no longer win and is eliminated. Tied or games that are a draw (you can play to a time limit as well) are determined by the value of each players remaining pieces, which are from 5 - 20 points each.<br/><br/>"}, "4555": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1289217.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"233": {"name": "Johann R\u00fcttinger"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1986", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"233": "Johann R\u00fcttinger"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"24954": {"name": "Dourios"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1289217_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "description": "Das Blaue Amulett (The Blue Amulet) is a fairly simple boardgame in which the players take on the roles of princes trying to be the first to reach the Castle of Light to claim their inheritance.
