The mechanics are more complex than the average children's roll-and-move game.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of four cards at the start of the game and draw one card at the start of each turn.  There are several different types of cards in the deck:<br/><br/>- Bionics Cards (Cards for Steve Austin's Bionic Eye, Bionic Arm, and Bionic Leg abilities)<br/>- &quot;Wild&quot; Bionics Cards (May be used as any type of Bionics)<br/>- Move Opponent<br/>- Set Obstacle<br/>- Remove Obstacle<br/><br/>Some of the spaces on the board are marked with one or more bionics symbols that represent cards the player must use to get past that particular challenge.  For example, you may need to use a Bionic Eye card to spot an enemy airplane or use one Bionic Arm and two Bionic Leg cards in order to swim across a treacherous river.  A player landing on one of these spaces must discard the needed cards before being able to move again.<br/><br/>The obstacles are balanced by the paths that the player can take across the board.  The shortest path from start to finish is densely populated with some heavy challenge spaces (requiring up to four cards to get past).  By contrast, the longer routes have a smaller density of challenge spaces, usually with one to two card challenges.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the players move by the difference of a roll of two dice.  Roll two dice and subtract the lower number from the higher to determine how far you move.  This means that rolling doubles means you get zero; you don't move.<br/><br/>The rules I have are incomplete.  They do not explain how to use the Move Opponent, Set Obstacle, or Remove Obstacle cards.<br/><br/>"}, "29005": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic256024.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"7189": {"name": "Jim Long"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"6509": {"name": "Red Juggernaut, Inc."}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic256024_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Battue: The Walls of Tarsos is the first expansion Battue: Storm of the Horse Lords.

The object is to win the most battles in any given round to become Captain for the next round. But be careful &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t win ANY battles in a round, you&rsquo;re out of the game. You&rsquo;re dealt fewer cards in each successive round, and the player who wins the final round wins the game! Play is fast and furious, with an average game time of only 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Walk the Plank comes with a deck of 68 cards. The deck has sixty-five numbered cards, two Walk the Plank! cards, and one Sea Monster! card. The sixty-five numbered cards are divided into five suits: Doubloons, Hookhands, Monkeys, Parrots, and Peglegs. The cards in each suit are numbered 1 through 13, with 1 worth the least and 13 worth the most.<br/><br/>The first dealer, or Captain, deals 7 cards to each player in the first round of seven. Subsequent rounds deal one less card. (Round 2 is 6 cards, Round 3 is 5 cards, etc.) The Captain then turns over the top card on the deck so that everyone may see it. The suit of the card revealed will be trump for the first round. The trump suit is the most powerful suit in any given battle. For example, if Monkeys are trump, then a low card in Monkeys will beat even a higher-numbered card in any other suit. If the card the Captain turns over is a Walk the Plank! or a Sea Monster!, there is no trump suit for this first round. In every round after the first, whoever is Captain chooses the trump suit after looking at his or her cards.<br/><br/>The suit of the first card played in a battle is called the current suit. If this card is a numbered card, it may or may not be from the trump suit. If the first card played in a battle is one of the three special cards, there is no current suit for that battle, but each player still has to play one card.<br/><br/>You must play a card of the same suit as the first card played in each battle, if you can. We call this following suit. So if you have any cards in your hand of the same suit as the first one played in a battle, you have to pick one and play it. You don&rsquo;t have to follow suit if you have no cards in the current suit. You don&rsquo;t have to follow suit if you have a special card (Walk the Plank! or Sea Monster!), unless you choose not to play the special card.<br/><br/>Walk the Plank! will win any battle, beating even the highest card in the trump suit&mdash;think of it as a &ldquo;wild card&rdquo; worth one more than the highest card in play. When someone plays Sea Monster!, no one wins the battle, no matter what cards<br/>have been played. The player who played Sea Monster! doesn't win the battle, but he/she does gain control. (So he/she gets to choose the current suit for the next battle by playing the first card.)<br/><br/>The player who wins the battle in the round becomes the Captain in the next round, which means you get to play the first card in the next battle.<br/><br/>If you win one or more battles in a round in which no other player wins a battle, you win the game!<br/><br/>"}, "29011": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mensch \u00e4rgere Dich nicht: Das Kartenspiel", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic201415_t.jpg", "average": "3.21429", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"38": {"name": "Schmidt Spiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic201415.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"148680": "German first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The object of the game is to be the first to have a set (1-6) of the same color.

Led by one of Rome&rsquo;s favorite son&rsquo;s, German born Arminius, turned on those that loved and trained him, leading four German tribes (18000 men) into deadly battle with Varus&rsquo; Roman Army. The German ambush at the Kalkriese Narrows ( a narrow strip of land only 220m wide) caught the Romans by complete surprise with an am-bush. One the 2nd day, all 20000 Romans had been killed. This game focuses on the second day as the Romans approached the narrows and the German attack !<br/><br/>The map scale is about 550 yards per hex. Each combat unit is a cohort of 500 men for the Roman and between 500-1000 men for the German. A game turn represents one hour of time.<br/><br/>The design is unique and captures the flavor of battle during this period. The game depends upon the German player and when he launches his devastating attack. In fact, until the German attacks, the Romans simply casually march towards their destination. When the attacks begin, blood will spill across the map as the Romans try desperately try to maintain damage control.

My copy came with a sheet of 27 (9x3) brown markers in addition to 25 already cut-out markers - were 2 sheets of each color provided? Additionally the rules state that each player starts with $1,900 (not $1,000) broken out into 16 $100 bills, 4 $50 bills and 20 $5 bills, meaning there should be at least 64 $100 bills, 16 $50 bills and 80 $5 bills in a complete set, maybe more]. Players move around the board contributing money into the Sweepstakes purse. buying horses, and buying sweepstakes tickets.<br/><br/>If a player lands on a square already owned by another player, the player makes a side bet of 5.00 by paying the fee to the owner of the horse. If that horse eventually wins the owner must pay off the bettor at odds shown below the name and price of his horse.<br/><br/>A player must be on the yellow circuit of the board in order to win. If a roll puts his marker past the &quot;winning post&quot; square on his first time around he must go around the circuit once more. As he hears the 'Winning Post&quot; position a 2nd time he must stop if a roll were to take him past the square and then on another turn re-roll and try again to hit the Winning Post square by exact roll. If he does he takes all the money in the Sweeps Fund, pays off all bets on his horse and then wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "29182": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5039": {"name": "Walter Lantz"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Woody Woodpecker", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "1968", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"17146": "Characters: Woody Woodpecker"}, "boardgameartist": {"5039": "Walter Lantz"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1992": {"name": "E.

Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled.

If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn.

Hitler issued goals that ranged from the far oil fields to a city on the Volga by the name of Stalingrad, finally deciding not to decide and ordered the far flung Army Group to divide and go for both.<br/><br/>Across endless steppe, in the blazing sun and freezing cold, the Axis legions advanced to the edge of Asia and the Caucasus mountains. Some of the oil fields, and most of the city were taken.<br/><br/>Then the Red Army had its turn...<br/><br/>Case Blue is a game that covers both the Axis advance (1941 and 1942) as well as the Soviet counterattacks (Nov 42 to Jan 43) and the German counteroffensive at Kharkov (Feb-March 1943) that ended the series of campaigns in the south. The game covers in great detail all the operations from October 1941 until May 1943 on a large play area extending from Voronezh almost to the Turkish border. The full scope and grandiose nature of these operations come to life here.<br/><br/>Case Blue covers and replaces the 1994 award winning game Enemy at the Gates. Players get to encircle Stalingrad, run their pocket and relief attempts and the many operations that game covered.<br/><br/>Case Blue is the 10th game in the award winning Operational Combat System and is the result of over 6 years of intensive research and testing. Players control units ranging from battalions through divisions (OK, there are a few very strange companies), making key decisions on the use, objectives, and means of war. The series is based on modern concepts of maneuver warfare and allows players a far more insightful look into how campaigns (large and small) really work.<br/><br/>Case Blue is designed to be played both separately or linked to the 2001 game Guderian's Blitzkrieg II. The monster linked game allows players to run operations on the entire Eastern Front (except for Leningrad) from the fall of 1941 until mid-1943.<br/><br/>Multiple scenarios (one map to very large) allow play to be picked up at various key points in the campaign.<br/><br/>If you want a serious look at these pivotal campaigns while having fun at the same time, this is the game for you.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Operational Combat System finest hour, this game is huge.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: Half Week<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km<br/>Units: Company to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Nine 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets (Maps A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K)<br/>One 14 x 22&quot; full-color mapsheet (Map E)<br/>Ten dual-side printed countersheets (2,660 1/2&quot; Unit counters)<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2&quot; Marker counters)<br/>One 48-page OCS v4.0 series rules booklet<br/>One 16-page Case Blue game rules booklet<br/>One 80-page Case Blue Scenario Book 1<br/>One 48-page Case Blue Scenario Book 2<br/>One 24-page Case Blue Axis Booklet<br/>One 24-page Case Blue Russian Booklet<br/>Two 4-page two-color OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"43841": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "average": "8.18151", "name": "Case Blue", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "253", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"11966": "Country: Russia"}}, "29286": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic337920.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"51": {"name": "Hasbro"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic337920_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "Stratego with an American Civil War theme.

This time, in July, from the 13th to 23rd, the German front at the Koltov area shattered from the weight of the Russian 3rd and 4th Tank armies breaking through a narrow 3-4 km gap in the German lines. As the 8th and 1st Panzer Divisions counterattacked, Russian aircraft filled the skies and wreaked carnage upon the 8th Panzer. Further north, a large German pocket had been created, which attempted to breakout. As German forces were tossed into the relief effort, the front shattered like glass. The 16th Pz and 20th PG Divisions but could barely hold their positions as the two massive Russian tank armies streaked for the Vistula River!<br/><br/>This unique game has both players secretly issuing orders (five to select from) to each one of their formations. When revealed, a player's plan may be enhanced or wrecked depending on the orders issued to the opposing formation! It captures the reality of war quite well. Combat losses are in strength points. The German has a hard road to hold in this game as the Russian tank armies exploit the Koltov gap that is always created. The Russian also has some hefty victory conditions that require most objectives on the map to be in their control.

It's also not to be confused with the same author's Beowulf: The Legend. It's an abstract strategy clothed in a theme based on the movie directed by Robert Zemeckis. The players' goal is to score the most victory points by clever tile and figurine placement on the board, composed of squares arranged in a grid. Its layout is changed, as the game is divided into three chapters that feature slightly different sets of tiles that can be drawn. Clever hand management (of tiles and figurines) is also important in the game, as some of them can be used only once throughout the entire game. Gameplay is as follows:<br/><br/>1. On his or her turn, a player may either place a tile (which can be a negative or a positive number, feature a special power or not) or a figurine on the board. If the player wishes to place a tile, he/she can add one to his/her hand of two and place one of the three tiles. Special powers of these tiles may be: displace a figurine, swap a tile from the board from the one from a player's hand, block other tiles, increase the power of figurines in the same row/column, cancel positive numbers on tiles, swap two tiles on the board.<br/><br/>2. By placing tiles and figurines, players will form rows and columns. After the board is full, the value of each figurine is calculated. Each figurine has a value of 1-4. This value is multiplied by the sum of values of all tiles from tiles that are in its row and column. Special powers of tiles may apply here (like the increasing of figurines' power or blocking). Players evaluate all their figurines on the board and gain points equal to their value.<br/><br/>This game differs considerably from its predecessor (not all of these may apply to the third English edition by Fantasy Flight Games released in 2012):<br/><br/>1. In Kingdoms, all three acts took place on the same board. Here, the board is two-sided, with three varying grids.<br/>2. There are more positive tiles than negative ones in this game, therefore situations when players lose points for their figurines are much less frequent.<br/>3. Here, a player manages a hand of three tiles. In Kingdoms, the players had no hand. Instead, he/she drew a single tile which had to be placed on the board.<br/>4. There are more tiles with special powers. More tiles can be swapped, even figurines can change their position, which didn't happen in Kingdoms.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"75299": "Baltic Edition"}, "average": "6.35982", "name": "Beowulf: The Movie Board Game", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "1369", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"7005": "Animals: Dragons"}}, "29309": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic206746.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"41159": {"name": "B'Maso!"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"6649": {"name": "Richard Clarke"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgamepublisher": {"5109": {"name": "Too Fat Lardies"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic206746_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "description": "Platoon level World War 2 miniature wargames rules.<br/><br/>Troops, Weapons &amp; Tactics (TW&amp;T) is not just a rule set.

It started before the birth of Christ (B.C.) and lasted, in the East, until year 476 A.D. (anno domini) and, in the West, until 1453 A.D. Let us go back to year 140 D.C., when this Empire reached its greatest extension and dominated practically all Europe, part of Asia and northern Africa. Times that were not completely peaceful, for enemies threatened the borders of the empire and the conquered people insurrected against domination, seeking freedom. Go back in time with War: Roman Empire and feel the thrill of defending your borders and advancing your legions, conquering provinces of the roman world in 140 A.D.! Observe, though, that the political division of the provinces adopted in the board objectives to ease the game mechanics, and not portrait the reality of that age. All province and sea names are written in latin. Only the region names are in portuguese. Each players is dealt an objective, that will only be known by himself. The knowledge of this objective by other players will make your conquest harder. It is important for the player to, when reading the rules, try some practical plays, simulating, inclusively, the mentioned examples.

Each player is dealt thirteen cards.<br/><br/>The auction process is more simple than bridge. Each player counts the number of high card points he has (4 for an Ace, 3 for a King, 2 for a Queen and 1 for a Jack) and states the number of high card points. The partnership with the more high card points then has to play the hand. (If both partnerships have the same number of high card points, the hand is thrown in.) Of this partnership, the partner with the more high card points becomes the declarer. The partner with the fewer high card points becomes the dummy and lays out his hand.

He was faced by well entrenched Boer commandos who inflicted a reverse upon the British that ultimately led to Buller being relieved of command.<br/><br/>Redvers Reverse is a solitaire area movement game that recreated the difficulties for the British in trying to affect a successful crossing of the Thukela against the Boer commandos (who are played by the game system).<br/><br/>The game is at Battalion and Battery level with emphasis upon the leadership of the British at a Brigade level for Infantry and at Divisional level for the Cavalry.<br/><br/>The key feature of the game is to present the player with the problems and difficulties that Buller himself faced. The player is provided with the same level of information and ability to influence events.<br/><br/>Units are activated by orders sent from HQ to the various commanders, with the caveat that the receiving commander may not react as required. Orders remain in place until a rout or a commander initiative role. The nature of orders are to occupy a designated area.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved rolling a 10 sided dice with a minimum number to hit. The impact on the two sides, from hits received, differs considerably due to the asymmetrical situation, both historically and in game terms. In addition there are numerous die modifiers for Dug in (mostly Boer), Terrain of area, Density of units in the area, Flank fire etc etc.<br/><br/>Boer fire is usually determined by each Gruppe firing at the closest occupied area but there are certain designated exceptions.<br/><br/>Besides combat loses units can become Disrupted, Suppressed or Rout. Leaders can Stand Firm or Panic. Both Units and Leader can recover from these postures during the Recovery Phase.<br/><br/>For the British it is a race against time, the longer he delays the higher the Boer confidence goes, this is measured by a &lsquo;Confidence track&rsquo; which rises and falls according to events on the Battlefield. As the level of Boer confidence, alongside the extent of the Boer loses, is central to determining if the Boer retire and thus the British win, it must be kept low at all costs. This simple rule prevents the British concentrating against the Hlangwane and turning the Boer flank, he just hasn&rsquo;t got the time to redeploy his forces.<br/><br/>There will also be a simple rule to handle Hart&rsquo;s confusion when trying to find a fordable crossing of the Thukela.<br/><br/>The Boer Gruppe are in their historical positions but their exact Firepower can change slightly from turn to turn. The British player does not know the exact firepower of each Gruppe until they are engaged. As loses are inflicted upon the Boer&rsquo;s their firepower will slowly decline and the likelihood of them withdrawing slowly increase. Whether or not they withdraw is determined at the end of each game turn by revealing the full firepower available, the position on the &lsquo;Confidence track&rsquo; and a die role.<br/><br/>The British can win but it won&rsquo;t be easy, the system will win most of the time.

It is significant for a number of reasons; it was the first time that the French army used a large-scale attack with tanks supported by a surprise (i.e. not pre-registered) artillery bombardment, similar to the British attack the previous year at Cambrai, and it was the first time that full-size US divisions went on the offensive incorporated in the French army. But most importantly, it was the opening of the Second Battle of the Marne. It not known at the time, although suspected by many, that this battle was the death-knell of the German army.<br/><br/>French 10 Army, reinforced by US troops, had been assembled to strike the over-stretched German forces on one side of the Soissons &ndash; Ch&acirc;teau Thierry &ndash; Reims salient. The French had sixteen infantry divisions, including two US corps-sized divisions, as well as over three hundred tanks. The Germans facing them consisted of ten divisions, the quality of which varied widely although all had taken a bettering during the Spring Offensive fighting. The German positions had been reached a few weeks previously during the final thrust of the offensives and therefore there had been no time to extensively fortify it; thus the battle was far more mobile than most of those previously on the Western Front. In addition, German artillery was sparse at the start of the battle because all of the heavy &amp; super-heavy artillery in the area had been sent north for the planned Hagen Offensive in Flanders, giving the French a roughly 2.5:1 advantage in artillery. Although the battle continued beyond when the game ends, it was largely over by the 23 July, progress after that day being very slow, which is why the simulation terminates on that day. The German defence at Soissons was skilfully executed, particularly as the attack had been a complete surprise.<br/><br/>This simulation helps illustrate the serious problems facing commanders in the Great War. Even with the element of complete surprise and greater numbers of troops &amp; equipment facing a tired enemy, the French army was unable to maintain the pace of the advance attained on the first two days. This was not through any lack of competence but because during the war the defence could nearly always bring in reinforcements of men and equipment faster than the attacker could. Popular opinion might believe that commanders in the war were almost without exception poor but an examination of this battle shows how sophisticated the armies on the Western Front had become. By this stage in the war, commanders could almost guarantee breaking through the enemy frontline but the difficulty was maintaining the advance once attacking troops had gone beyond friendly artillery cover. Both the French and the German player will need their wits about them to better the achievements of their historical counter-parts. The simulation will succeed if players come away with a sense of how difficult it was for the historical commanders to achieve a decisive victory with the fragile assets available. It is hoped that it will draw some attention to a very interesting battle that Robert Citino calls &lsquo;the turning point on the western front&rsquo;.<br/><br/>"}, "29378": {"boardgamedesigner": {"83756": {"name": "John J.

The first battles began with the bombing of the island in ealry 1942 and ended in May of that year with it's surrender.<br/> After General Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines, Corregidor once again became a target of invasion, both to avenge the loss three years before and to clear the mouth of Manila Bay to Allied shipping.<br/> Corregidor: Fall of a Fortress 1942/1945, includes two games. The first game recreates the Japanese bombardment and invasion in 1942 and the second simulates the American airborne invasion and reconquest in 1945.<br/><br/><br/>EXTENDED GAME DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>CORREGIDOR is played in successive game turns composed of alternate player turns during which the phasing player maneuvers his units and resolves combat in sequence. Turns consist of the Administrative Phases (reinforcement arrival, disruption removal, Fired marker removal), the Air Attack Phase (which includes airborne assault), first Player Turn (AA fire, bombardment, invasion, ground movement, and combat), and then the second Player Turn.<br/><br/>Some detail features of the game are tracking Japanese landing craft losses, American communications disruption, U.S. air and naval support points, unit disruption levels, and which artillery units have fired.<br/><br/>The six hexes adjacent to an undisrupted land unit constitute that unit&rsquo;s Zone of Control. Disrupted land units DO NOT have ZOCs, and therefore judicious use of support to disrupt enemy units allows the attacker to infiltrate through weak positions and to launch flanking attacks against defending units. This is critical because defending units are doubled and sometimes tripled by the rugged and the unique features on the maps, such as rough terrain, cliffs, elevation changes, tunnels, towns, and coast defense artillery emplacements.<br/><br/>In the 1942 scenarios, there is a cat-and-mouse game which develops between the Japanese artillery and air units versus the American artillery and anti-aircraft defenses. Aircraft need to designate the altitude at which they conduct bombing &ndash; the lower the attack level the more accurate the bombing, but also the more accurate the AA fire. Similarly, artillery which fires is more vulnerable to counter-battery fire and so making a bombardment attack must be weighed against the possibility of return fire.<br/><br/>In 1945, in addition to banzai options, the Japanese have the option to make suicide demolitions, which destroy the attacking unit but also damage adjacent units. There is a mechanism to occasionally compel such attacks, which not only forces some historicity but it also models the uncoordinated local Japanese command structure in 1945.<br/><br/>Some optional rules included:<br/><br/>Spike Rule - U.S. Batteries must be spiked when Japanese units come within two hexes to prevent them from being captured in usable condition. They may not be voluntarily destroyed until after a Japanese unit has landed on their island. Flip the battery over after the following U.S. Bombardment Phase. The unit may then move and fight normally.<br/><br/>Restored Batteries - Roll one die on the turn of the American invasion in 1945 for the surviving former U.S. batteries:<br/> 1 &ndash; Battery may fire normally.<br/> 2 &ndash; Battery sabotaged by POWs, gun crew fights as infantry.<br/>3-6 &ndash; Battery was never manned; remove from map.<br/><br/>Additional U.S. Batteries - Three 240mm howitzer batteries which were to be installed in 1922 actually arrive. One battery is deployed anywhere on Fort Frank, one on Fort Hughes, and one on Fort Mills (Corregidor).<br/><br/>Philippine Division Transferred - The 31st, 45th, and 57th Regiments are transferred to Corregidor prior to the fall of Bataan. Add them to the available U.S. forces in Scenario 11.1. Due to the effects of fighting on Bataan, plus short rations and disease, these units are deployed at reduced strength. As an additional option, they may be deployed at full strength to simulate these units being in better condition historically.<br/><br/>Itagaki Rule - Japanese defense commander Capt. Itagaki did not believe an airborne assault could be made on Corregidor. He was killed on Topside during the initial paradrop, while waiting to observe the amphibious assault for which he had prepared. Additionally, his central communications station was overrun very quickly by the paratroops. In this rule, he is killed and no Japanese unit may move until the first night turn.<br/><br/>U.S. Roving Batteries - During the campaign for Bataan and Corregidor, the U.S. created a number of &ldquo;roving batteries&rdquo; of 155mm guns by removing them from their emplacements and mounting them such that they could be moved about Corregidor.<br/><br/>U.S. Searchlights - The U.S. had several searchlight batteries on the Fortified Islands. This option forces the Japanese to actually expend the effort to destroy them and if they are not, they provide some advantage to the U.S. Player.<br/><br/>If a Japanese invasion or evacuation is occurring in a night turn and there is an active U.S. searchlight unit on the map, the U.S. Player receives a +2 die modifier (cumulative with any other DRMs) when firing on Japanese units in water hexes.<br/><br/>If a Japanese air bombardment is conducted at night, U.S. Anti-aircraft fire receives an additional +1 modifier to any other DRMs which apply; Japanese Bombardment rolls receive an additional -1 modifier to any other DRMs which apply.<br/><br/>Battery Way - Battery Way did not have a crew and was not operational until April 28. The U.S. might have activated this battery sooner. Roll at the beginning of the 0300 daily turn. The battery is active at full strength on a roll of 2 or 12. The battery becomes active automatically on Turn 65 if not activated sooner.<br/><br/><br/>Game scale<br/>Unit size: Generally artillery batteries and infantry platoons, with some company- and section-size units. Some individual naval units are depicted; air units are generally three aircraft per step.<br/><br/>Game turn: Movement and combat on the Fortified Islands maps is in three-hour turns in 1942, and two-hour daylight turns in 1945, with night turns representing five hours each. There are also daily turns to keep track of reinforcements as well as to frame the complete campaigns. By mutual agreement, players may skip any daily or hourly turn in which neither player plans to execute any movement, combat, or bombardment.<br/><br/>Hex scale: The scale of the Fortified Islands map is roughly 250 yards per hex; the scale of the Bataan map is roughly 1.25 miles per hex.<br/><br/>"}, "29379": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2216140.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"7610": {"name": "Kim Kanger"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"7610": "Kim Kanger"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"9512": {"name": "Legion Wargames LLC"}}, "maxplaytime": "300", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2216140_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "300", "boardgamecategory": {"1069": {"name": "Modern Warfare"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"21210": "2009 Charles S.

It cost the lives of at least half a million Algerians, it brought the tumultuous exodus of one million French settlers from Algeria and it brought France itself to the brink of civil war. But to be portrayed as a game has its difficulties, though. How do you recreate the fact that the side which lost militarily won the war? How do you make it interesting to play when FLN never succeeded in creating an army, like the Viet Minh did in the Indochina war, and therefore was never able to rival the French?<br/><br/>To address this, the game contains &ldquo;three games&rdquo; within the game: A political, an insurgency and a military game. Politics are driven by chits which alter four parameters: FLN structure; Algerian population; Pied noir feelings (the French settlers in Algeria) and French public/government. Each one will affect the play, in different ways, when it changes. What eventually ends the game is when the French public reaches 0 and calls for a referendum. Then you check each region whether they will vote to stay with France or become independent. If a majority votes pro-France, the French player win and vice versa. It is through different insurgency or counterinsurgency actions that you will make a region pro-FLN or pro-France. Finally, the military part will allow you to contest or control regions. This will affect your ability to mobilize, tax and conduct insurgency/counterinsurgency actions.<br/><br/>In other words, you will have to fight to control, conduct insurgency/counterinsurgency actions in order to win the hearts and minds of the population and, through politics, see to it that the public in France either supports you or gets fed up with the war. Some things might help you in one way but at the same time give disadvantages in other aspects. Nothing in war is purely a good decision. There is always a cost.<br/><br/>Each year has four gameturns. You start the game with eight random political chits of 28 possible ones. Each chit may only be played during a certain time span and after you play a chit you will draw a new one.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;operation points&rdquo; are the main engine in the game. You will receive a certain number of points and with these points you will pay for everything you do, like recruiting or bringing in reinforcements, certain movement, fighting and conducting insurgency/counterinsurgency actions.<br/><br/>FLN recruitment will depend on how pro-FLN the Algerian population is and how efficient the FLN structure is. It will also depend on population density and whether they control a region or not. The French can bring in new units and replacements, but it will cost operation points and put pressure on the French public. So the reason to attack is to control/contest as much as possible and to force the opponent to spend operation points to replenish his force.<br/><br/>The counters have no movement points. With a gameturn of three months there is no lack of time to position units anywhere on the map. You follow the road network (as French) but it will cost you operation points when you pass regions which are controlled by the enemy. FLN moves off-road and will have some limitations to whether they may leave a region or not. The numbers represent strength and quality.<br/><br/>Fighting will include combat chits which in certain combination will affect the combat. My first ambition is to minimize the amount of tables in order to make the game faster to play. You roll a number of dice corresponding with your strength and modify your roll with the difference in quality. You get a hit when you roll 5-6. The complexity and difficulties lies more in what to decide and when to do it.<br/><br/>Best regards<br/>Kim Kanger<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"243416": "First edition with slipcover"}, "average": "7.77704", "name": "Ici, c'est la France!

Part of Admiral Nimitz's Operation Granite II, the seizure of the Marianas was divided into two parts, the Northern Troops Landing Force (NTLF) and the Southern Troops Landing Force (STLF). Saipan and Tinian were the objectives for the NTLF, with Saipan being the immediate objective and Tinian the second. The STLF objective was Guam. Before the Capture of Saipan both the US Navy and the Japanese Navy had powerful carrier based air forces, and with the exception of China based aircraft, no US land based aircraft could reach homeland Japan. After the capture of Saipan only the US Navy had a powerful carrier based air arm, and powerful land based bombers could now bomb Japan relentlessly.<br/><br/>Tinian is a simulation of the American invasion and capture of Tinian in the summer of 1944. Tinian was the first US Marine Corps sized shore-to-shore operation and it was the first time napalm was used against enemy troops. After its seizure Tinian was developed into the greatest B-29 base in the war. B-29s from Tinian flew 29,000 missions and dropped over 157,000 tons of bombs on Japan by the end of the war, including the two atomic bomb missions flown by the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and &quot;Bocks Car&quot; against Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br/><br/>Saipan Game Components:<br/>17&quot; x 22&quot; map<br/>270 Double-sided game counters<br/><br/>Tinian Game Components:<br/>11&quot; x 17&quot; map<br/>180 Double-sided counters<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/>Unit size: Platoon, Company, and Battalion<br/>Scale: Hex scale: 1/2 mile<br/>Game Turn: Each turn represents 12 hours<br/><br/>The Island War Series game system is a simulation of ground combat in the Pacific during World War II. Each game in the system represents a battle between Allied and Imperial Japanese forces on one of the many Pacific Islands.<br/>The series begins with Vol. I - Saipan/Tinian and will also include Guam - Vol. II , and Attu &amp; Kiska - Vol. III.<br/><br/>Two sets of rules are provided with each game. The first contains the Standard Rules that are common to all the games in the Pacific Island Series. The second set contains the Exclusive Rules for each game in the system, which includes Special rules, the Initial Deployment and the Reinforcement Schedule. Generally the unit scale is battalion, but there are company and platoon formations represented. The time scale, unless noted in the Exclusive rules, is 1/2 day per turn.<br/><br/>Due to the nature of the battles covered in the series, all naval and air forces are abstract. This means the main focus of each game is ground combat. The games are designed for two players, but can accommodate multiple players. For example, one player can play the US Marines, one can play the US Army, and the third plays the Japanese.<br/><br/>This series of games is loosely based on or inspired by several different game systems, including SPI's Island War series and GRD/GDW's Europa series, but many concepts are quite original. The tactical situation for the defender can be described as &quot;against the odds&quot;, which means it will be very difficult for the player playing the  defender to win the game tactically. The victory conditions are designed in such a way that the defender can win by performing better than his historical counterpart. This also puts a lot of pressure on the attacker because he cannot afford to make many mistakes.<br/><br/>Game features include:<br/>1. Limited intelligence<br/>2. Amphibious Landings<br/>3.

The Germans believed they could launch an offensive on both sides of Reims, which would pinch out an Allied salient and draw in Allied reserves, and thus possibly produce a breakout across the Marne leading to the final drive to Paris. Despite gaining their bridgehead across the Marne, the Germans did not expect the fierce resistance offered by the Allies including the American 3rd infantry division-which earned its honorific name &ldquo;Rock of the Marne&rdquo; for its steadfast defense.<br/><br/>An even bigger surprise awaited the Germans, however, when the Allies attacked them with crushing power from a wholly unforeseen direction three days later. Refusing at first to relinquish the initiative, the Germans showed why they were masters of defensive warfare in World War 1 as they exacted a fearsome toll in casualties from the attackers including the American 1st and 2nd infantry divisions.<br/><br/>Rock of the Marne shares many of its design features with MMP&rsquo;s earlier game on the 1918 battles - Operation Michael. The Germans&rsquo; striking power consists of the battle-depleted, but still dangerous, stosstruppen. Trained specifically in infiltration tactics, these hard-core infantry units can find a way to pick apart the toughest Allied defensive position. The Germans also have mobile, and deadly, machine-gun units that will wreak havoc on unwary attacking Allied units. The Allies used tanks in record numbers in their initial assault, and these are shown in the game, as well as the six big American divisions that participated including the famous 1st Infantry Div, The Big Red One, the 42nd Infantry Div, the Rainbow Division, as well at the 3rd.<br/><br/>The air game has been significantly expanded in Rock of Marne as both sides deploy their air assets to bomb bridges, and strafe infantry. Finally, both the Allied and the German player must learn to operate within their constraints and opportunities of the WWI command and control environment, which means you may not automatically get to attack with all the units you had planned!<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    One 22&quot;x34&quot; map<br/>    280 counters (1 countersheet)<br/>    Series Rules<br/>    Rock of the Marne Specific Rules<br/>    Two Dice<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Part of the Standard Combat Series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"31342": "Multi-Man Publishing first edition"}, "average": "6.65357", "name": "Rock of the Marne", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "112", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"121": "Standard Combat Series"}}, "29383": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic230942.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"406": {"name": "Dean Essig"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"11857": "Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"196": {"name": "Multi-Man Publishing"}}, "maxplaytime": "360", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic230942_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "GD &rsquo;42: The Battle in the Luchessa Valley, 29 November - 4 December, 1942, covers the desperate battle for survival of the GD Division as it faced down the entire Soviet 3rd Mech Corps (with over 200 tanks) over several days. 25 November, 1942: As part of Operation Mars, the Soviet 238th Rifle Division, supported by tanks of the 49th Tank Brigade, attacked into the Luchessa Valley, trying to create a breach for the waiting 3rd Mech Corps to exploit. For reasons still unknown, right before the attack the German 9th Army ordered three battalions the GD Division to move to the Luchessa Valley as OKH reserve, thus backing up the weak 216th Grenadier Regiment.

The Metis (half Native and half European) set up a provisional government to try and get recognition of their concerns with the federal government in Ottawa.<br/><br/>The federal government orders a detachment of Mounties to confiscate any weapons located at the Metis settlement of Duck Lake. The Mounties were met by a force of Metis and Natives and initially there was just talk. However, during the course of the discussion a gun was discharged and within minutes, the battle was on! The Mounties retreated, having taken 25% casualties - the rebellion was on.<br/><br/>To prevent the rebellion from spreading, the government in Ottawa quickly dispatches a military force which would grow to 5,000 troops, most transported by the nearly complete Canadian Pacific Railway. After 4 months and several battles later, the government had successfully suppressed the rebellion - if they had not, and this was their worst fear, the whole Northwest might have erupted in rebellion, keeping the government busy for years.<br/><br/>The basic military unit in the game is the battalion. All the battalions that participated in the campaign are represented, as are the various Northwest Mounted Police detachments, local militias, artillery, and Gatling guns. They are faced by the Metis, the Woods Cree, and the Plains Cree. Units can remain together as battalions, or they can break down. Morale is better as a battalion, while mobility is better as a breakdown unit. Each strength point represents 50 men.

Each player has a &quot;king&quot; (the Communication and Command Pod, or C.C.P.) that must be captured for the opponent to win.  The board is 15-by-15 squares, divided into 9 5x5 sections.  And there is a repeating pattern of walls that restrict movement.  The basic movement mechanic is that each piece (individually called &quot;Pods&quot;) moves a given number of segments, called &quot;Direction Changes&quot; or D.C.'s.  For example, a piece with 3 D.C.'s could move forward as many spaces as it wants (subject to walls of course), then left as many spaces as it wants, and then forward again.  Pods must move their entire number of D.C.'s without backtracking.<br/><br/>In addition to the basic movement mechanic of D.C.'s, many of the pieces  have additional movement abilities, such as the Jump Pod (J.P.) that can jump over one piece during its movement, or the Variable Direction Change Pod (V.D.C.P.) which has a choice as to how many D.C.'s it may make when it moves.<br/><br/>There is a basic game (nine pods), and an advanced version which adds four more pods.  They give an even more advanced version (which they call &quot;POD Pinnacle&quot;) in which the nine board parts are set up in a non-standard way.  You can also combine two sets together for a four-player game (assuming the pieces are of four different colors), and presumably, you could combine even more sets together for as many players as you want, as long as you have some means of distinguishing each player's pieces from the others.<br/><br/>"}, "29438": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8711": {"name": "Bill Kuhnely"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Slahal", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "1600", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic211097_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"171": {"name": "(Public Domain)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic211097.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Slahal (pronounced sle -`hal) is an indigenous very old, Pacific Coast Indian Gambling Game.

It is played, either as a two player game or as a team game. It originally used small pieces of animal bone as game pieces but now many kinds of substances have replaced those bones. Pieces of antler having both a rounded side and a flat side were used while a grouping of separate sticks serve as the score keeping method. Each team begins with a set number of scoring sticks. The two game pieces (acting almost like dice) are picked up by a player and secretly arranged on a flat surface. This is done to the accompaniment of Native Music. The object of the game is to correctly guess where certain game bones are located in the opponents hand. During the playing of the music the pieces are arranged in different patterns, either both flat pieces down, both round pieces down or 1 going each way so that there are 4 possible combinations that can be accomplished. The opponent or the leader of the opposing team will motion to the other leader that they are ready to guess the direction of the unmarked bones. He uses a set of hand signals to make his guess. Each time he guesses incorrectly, he must throw one of his score keeping sticks to the opposing team. The team that eventually wins all of the opponents score keeping sticks wins the match<br/><br/>Nothing in this description was intentionally taken from the Elliott Avedon Museum &amp; Archive of Games, a public funded Museum in Canada who would not give permission for the Museum's description of the game to be used.

In shifting their forces to try and limit American expansion, the Spanish-loyal authorities opened the door to losing the remainder of two continents. Guerra a Muerte depicts the 14 year struggle that saw Spain's possessions in the hemisphere change from &quot;almost everything not U.S.&quot; to &quot;Cuba and Hispanola.&quot;<br/><br/>As in the American Revolution, the local population could be divided into &quot;patriots/revolutionaries&quot; on one side, &quot;loyalists/Royalists&quot; on the other, and a huge middle block of those who wished to stay out of battle--over which both sides exerted tremendous pressure, making these episodes as bitter as a period in history. The game title means, &quot;War to the Death,&quot; and comes from a proclamation Simon Bolivar made to all Spaniards in Venezuela--&quot;support us or else.&quot;<br/><br/>Warfare took place from the remote northern border with America to the tip of the continent now shared by Chile and Argentina. Progress ebbed and flowed, with territories changing hands several times and the intensity and size of battles slowly escalating.<br/><br/>The overall war is a fascinating struggle of varied elements, from Spanish and &quot;Royalist&quot; troops to formed patriot units, militias, armed mobs, Indians, and mercenaries. Actions include slave revolts, naval assaults, guerilla war, battles with a hostile environment, and the interplay of politics with economics...all depicted and intermeshed to affect overall play as they affected real events. The game offers a map from &quot;New Spain&quot; to &quot;Rio de la Plata,&quot; with area movement, one-year turns, and 280 half-inch counters.<br/><br/>Guerra a Muerte offers a chance to understand a hardly-heard-of period of Western history, the effects of which are still with us today.<br/><br/>A playaid sheet with additional optional rules are organized into one sheet and included on issue #27.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"30895": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.36087", "name": "Guerra a Muerte", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "46", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"10649": "Country: Colombia"}}, "29448": {"boardgamedesigner": {"8714": {"name": "Peter Solymosi"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Denker", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic221701_t.jpg", "average": "5.25", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"648": {"name": "Peri Spiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic221701.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"105806": "Peri German version"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Mixture of Rummy and Domino. 72 tiles and 12 wild tiles facedown.

Each player places his checkers in the back row of his side of the board.  The game turns alternate between the two players.  The number of checkers in a stack determines the distance that a stack may move.  Moves can be made in any of the eight corresponding directions and cannot be blocked by stacks situated in the path of the move.  All moves are done in a straight line unless the move would extend through 6 by 6 grid formation, in which case the move is reflected by the edge of the 6 by 6 grid like a mirror.  A stack belongs to the player whose piece is on top.  It might be noted that the arrangement and order of the pieces within a stack can never be altered except by continued stacking.  Captured stacks always remain on the board and become part of the stack must be included in the count for the new movement distance.  A player may use his turn to place a stack on top of another one of his own stacks.  During a turn a player has the option of moving one of his stacks or only its top portion which may include any number of pieces and may leave behind a stack also composed of any number of pieces.  The height of the new divided stack determines the new movement distance.<br/><br/>In 2005, the &quot;Too-Tall Rule&quot; or variant was introduced.  This rule states that at the beginning of a turn that any player's stacks taller than four pieces must be divided.
