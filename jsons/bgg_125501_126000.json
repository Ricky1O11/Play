However, the world in this shard is a distorted reflection of earth, where evolution and cultural development took many twists and turns, vastly different from the original. Numerous intelligent races and creatures, both frightening and wondrous, evolved alongside several subspecies of humans.<br/><br/>In this world, technology and civilization did not develop far beyond the iron age. Due to the primeval nature of this world, and the absence of advanced technologies, its inhabitants have learned to harness the extraordinary powers Mythos and Spirit. These forces are particularly pure and strong in Taramythica.<br/><br/>The Taramythica Shard expansion supplements the Core Rules, and will provide players of the Shards of the Shattered Universe Role Playing Game a completely developed, unique and original fantasy setting. The expansion includes new options for character creation, including six human subspecies and six non-human species, each with their own culture. In addition, the set will include an expanded bestiary, new weapons, armor, and equipment, including extraordinary (mythical and spiritual) items ranging from common to legendary power and rarity. Furthermore, the expansion will provide detailed crafting, mythical enchanting, and spiritual empowering rules. Finally, to help get players started in their campaigns and adventures, we have included a large variety of story hooks, unique to each region of Taramythica.<br/><br/>The expansion will be available in softcover and PDF format, concurrently with the release of the Shards of the Shattered Universe Core Rules and Combat Card Sets.<br/><br/>"}, "125554": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6518": {"name": "Hans-Peter Pauly"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Timeline", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2019": "Partnerships"}, "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamefamily": {"10311": "Country: Switzerland"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1664572_t.jpg", "average": "6.6125", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1935": {"name": "Carlit"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1664572.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"167423": "Carlit Edition 2009"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Timeline is a trivia board game about an exciting journey through Switzerland.<br/>Players answer the questions and if these are correct place that card in front of their teammates with a series of eight cards.

Most battles are fought against wild monsters encountered randomly in the wilderness, or generic kotodama battlers placed throughout the game map. Certain battles cannot be avoided because they are essential to the game's story. When the player enters a battle, the right side of the screen is the player's field, and the opposite side is the enemy's field. As a kotodama battler, the player has the ability to summon up to three friendly monsters to assist in battle, each placed on the top, mid, and lower sections of the screen.<br/><br/>There are four options available in the battle menu; &quot;Use kotodamas,&quot; &quot;Kotodama history,&quot; &quot;Defend,&quot; and &quot;Escape.&quot; Items cannot directly be used by the player, and battles are fought out entirely through the use of kotodamas. Turns are determined by the &quot;timecost&quot; assigned to each type of kotodama or monster, and begin when the other side's timecost goes to zero. Kotodama battlers begin each battle with a timecost of 5, and monsters may have a timecost shorter or longer than that according to their type.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Koto Battle: Tengai no Moribito&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "125616": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Carve", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"167551": "English/European Xbox edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2542": "Ocean / Sea"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4442": "Xbox"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Back of box:<br/> Get ready for the rush!

Neither the designer nor anyone else is allowed to make any financial profit from it.<br/><br/>About the game:<br/><br/>I hope you remember the great movie &ldquo;Inception&rdquo;. Cobb and his team of Extractors are offered a job to implant an idea into a person&acute;s mind by infiltrating his dreams. The target is Fischer and the client is Saito, who will profit greatly from Fischer's new &ldquo;idea&rdquo;. The reward: a lot of money and the chance for Cobb to return home to see his children. But to plant a thought deep enough into someone&acute;s mind, you&acute;ll have to go very deep. A dream within a dream&hellip; within another dream. And if you die in a dream, you&acute;ll end up in Limbo and probably go mad.<br/><br/>Guide Cobb and his team through the different dream levels. Recruit your team members and sedate Fischer in the waking reality. Step deeper into his dreams, plant Inceptions, and prepare for the final Kick that&acute;ll bring the team back home. Fight against attackers, Cobb's adversaries and Fischer&acute;s &ldquo;dream police&rdquo;. Cobb&acute;s wife Mal will show up and try to stop the team. And some of your team might end up in Limbo and have to be saved first before they can return to reality.<br/><br/>About the gameplay:<br/><br/>Inception is a solo (1-player) card game with a playing time of around 50 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Each turn the player draws 2 cards to his hand. Some negative cards (Cobb&acute;s Flashbacks) apply immediately, while the others may be played in the &ldquo;Play cards&rdquo; step. Cards may be played in different ways. They may be discarded to use their one-shop effects. Weapon cards may be attached to a character to increase his strength against attacks. Other cards may be placed in a dedicated &ldquo;Convince Display&rdquo; from which they may be played when trying to convince opponents or to plant Inceptions. But the player should also keep some cards in his hand, to either react to new Events or boost his strength when defending against an attacker. These are the tactical choices that have to be made and that will determine success or failure.<br/><br/>An Event card is drawn from the Dream Level the Characters are currently in. You will have to evade attacks, convince people, plant Inceptions in Fischer&acute;s mind, and face other challenges. Team members might die, as in the movie, and have to be found in Limbo and convinced to come back with you.<br/><br/>To win the game, the final Inception on Fischer has to be successful, Mal must be dead, and Saito, Cobb, and enough members for the final Kick must still be alive.<br/><br/>Designed for the BGG Solitaire Print and Play Contest 2012.<br/><br/>Inception is available<br/>as Print and Play (see file section)<br/>via ArtsCow,<br/>Printerstudio (thanks Jay)<br/>as PC game (thanks David)<br/>and as Vassal module.<br/>See forum section for links.<br/><br/>Microbadge: <br/><br/>"}, "125635": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Zill O'll Infinite", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"167598": "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"18386": "Zill O'll"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Set on the continent of Bioscian, you head out to a guild to take on different jobs and earn money.

Joint ventures between the countries have been undertaken and players are happy to travel beyond their own borders to participate in other countries events.<br/>With this book we are trying to collect some of the Knudepunkt magic. Knudepunkt has always been a forum where innovation and creativity have flourished and where people from the Nordic countries have shared their visions and dreams for the future of larp.<br/>The book, like Knudepunkt itself, is about moving on from yesterday into tomorrow. The aim is to help the Knudepunkt newbie up to date - as well as spawn creativity, innovation and ideas.<br/>There is nothing as practical as a good theory. That is the foundation for this book.

Formula 90 is a car-racing game simulating all the typical elements of a motor sport event: car strategies, weather changes, pit stops, tire management, overtaking, doubling, and of course damages and crashes.<br/><br/>In Race! every game turn represents one or more laps of the track, and each player is in control of only one car. Other cars, called robots, move automatically on the track fighting between them and the human players. Players are provided with a set of racing cards and a car chart to keep track of all available resources (tires, damages, reliability). By playing racing cards, they move along the track and in so doing they spend resources. Movement can be affected by trajectories on the track, straight, corner and braking sections, opponents and other special events like yellow or blue flags.<br/><br/>Braking sections have a particular feature: here players and robots can try late braking, a dangerous maneuver that allows them to overtake multiple cars simultaneously. Other maneuvers or cards require a &quot;check&quot;, e.g., playing a card with a check value lower than a predefined target.<br/><br/>Strategies and driving skills are another key element of the game. Players must exploit these unique capabilities to gain against competitors while adapting their driving style to the actual race conditions. When using a strategy at his best, a player achieves a &quot;special&quot;, which allows him to draw a track card, which is usually more powerful than ordinary racing cards.<br/><br/>Race! is a board game with no dice in which strategy and risk melt together to convey a truly intense and deep racing experience. Usually the winning player combines excellent management of his car together with a pinch of opportunism and bravery.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"167807": "English first edition"}, "average": "8.02701", "name": "Race!

The sounds from the crashing shells concealed the oncoming Chinese, until they burst forward in what was described as &ldquo;a moving carpet of yelling, howling men--whistles and bugles blowing, their officers screaming like women driving their men uphill.&rdquo; In a bunker CP just beneath the crest of the hill Corporal Dale W. Cain heard his radio come alive with reports of &ldquo;enemy in large numbers&rdquo;. Company A reported hand-to-hand fighting in the trenches. The battle was fought in a driving monsoon rain, making evacuation of the wounded difficult, as well as re-supply. As the battle swayed back and forth, the Chinese made repeated pushes to take the hill while both sides unleased a storm of artillery fire upon the struggling soldiers. During the course of two days, parts of four companies defended Pork Chop. At dawn on July 8th, the rain ended for a time and the initial defenders withdrawn. A fresh unit, 2nd Battalion of the 17th, counter-attacked and re-took the hill, then settled in to prepare a defensive perimeter for the coming night.<br/><br/>We suspect the majority of you out there have witnessed the movie &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot; more than once, with its stirring performance by Gregory Peck.

The game develops social skills by helping children learn to gather information about others and share information about themselves.

These conversational skills are used to teach children how to begin and maintain an interesting conversation. A variety of topics (a hobby that interests me, a movie I saw recently, my favorite season, etc.) are used to generate ideas, or stories, for the players to figure out.

It is the final in a trilogy of games, which include Earnest Evans, and El Viento. The menus and game screens are all in English, while the dialogue and ending credits are in Japanese.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Set in the same fictional universe as Earnest Evans and El Viento, the story takes place two years after El Viento, and concludes the story of Annet and Earnest. Zigfried's true motives are finally revealed as well. Being rescued from certain sacrifice by father figure Ernest Evans, Annet travels across Europe and encounters a local sect that wants her special pendant. After an attempted ambush in the sect's castle, she barely escapes, and begins another quest to protect the world from destruction.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Unlike the first and second entries, which are 2D platform video games, Annet Futatabi is a side scrolling beat-em-up that deeply resembles Sega's Golden Axe and Bare Knuckle franchises. However, like the previous installments, the story is told through cutscenes between each brief multi-scrolling level, which includes a boss character, who appears out of thin air, usually wielding a weapon.<br/><br/>Annet's magic has 5 levels and is regulated by a power meter, and regenerates automatically. As her power meter increases, the higher her magical attacks become. The levels range from wind, earth, water, fire, and death. Wind is the lower level, while death is the highest level. However, magic cannot be used against the bosses. In addition to magic, Annet wields a sword, rather than bladed boomerangs. There are not any other weapons or power-ups included in the game, other than health restoration items.<br/><br/>Annet's journey ranges from escaping an enemy castle, being captured and forced to fight in a colosseum, spelunking in a tomb,&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Anetto Futatabi&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "125795": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Game Geek (Issue 30 - Jun 2012)", "rpgproducer": {"5349": "Robert Hemminger"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1329333.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"5874": "Game Geek"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"81884": "''Heroes Wear Masks'' Adventure"}, "rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "rpgissueversion": {"167871": "PDF"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1329333_t.png", "description": "From the table of contents<br/><br/><br/>     Musing of the Avalon Stogie <br/>     Behind the Game, Heroes Wear Masks <br/>     Coral Throne Chapter 20 <br/>     GROMM <br/>     Avalon Pathfinder<br/>     Excerpt from Today's Promise<br/>     Wired Issue #3 <br/>     Multi-Verse <br/>     Heroes Wear Masks Adventure <br/>     Nova Blast <br/>     Avalon Models <br/>     Arcana<br/>     Reviews <br/>     What's New <br/>     Free Stuff <br/><br/><br/>"}, "125796": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1493339.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"5634": {"name": "Bob O'Connor"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": {"928": {"name": "Critical Hit, Inc."}}, "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1493339_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "description": "The ground-breaking GENESIS '48 module sold out a decade ago, and has been awaiting a new edition for years.

Da f&auml;hrt er auch schon weiter. Jetzt aber schnell hinterher und weitere Pakete aufladen; je mehr, desto besser!

The players start by placing first the pollen pieces on the center of the board with their own color face up. After which, the players can choose to place two bees with piece from previous turn in between them or place a lady bug to flip a row or play the ant to push a row. Each piece must link to another piece at all time. At least 4 pieces are needed to capture an opponent's piece. Each captured piece is removed from the board and has a point. A pollen, a bee, a lady and an ant has 1, 2, 3 and 4 points respectively.  The game ends with the first player to get 8 points.<br/><br/>The lady bug and ant are useful for capturing pieces. When played at early stage of the game may result into earning points but at the same time presents difficultly to get additional points at the end part of the game. This also draws your opponent to try to capture your high scoring piece to score big against you. When they are played near the end of the game, it may be also too late to catch up and score ahead.

Each player starts with two pirate hideouts on different islands, and they can use the resources they acquire to build ships, hideouts or get help from Coco the Parrot.

There are two ways to earn points in Clubs:<br/><br/><br/>    Play all your cards as quickly as possible each round.<br/>    Win tricks with clubs in them.<br/><br/><br/>To play a round, deal out 10 cards to each player. Players may call Double or Nothing anytime before playing their first card.  The player to the left of the dealer leads with a Trick-Type.  Legal Trick-Types include any singleton, pair, 3-of-a-kind, 4-of-a-kind, or any run of 2 or more cards. Players can either pass or follow with a similar hand of higher rank.  When all of the players have passed consecutively, the pile is taken by the person who played last. That player leads with a Trick-Type of their choice.<br/><br/>Players score bonus points for playing all of their cards each round.  A 6-player game has all of the following Bonus Cards:<br/><br/><br/>    12 bonus points + points for clubs<br/>    10 bonus points + points for clubs<br/>    8 bonus points + points for clubs<br/>    5 bonus points + points for clubs<br/>    2 bonus points + points for clubs<br/>    0 bonus points.  Do not score points for clubs<br/><br/><br/>The last player out for the round does not get bonus points and does not receive points for any clubs he may have taken. The points for clubs varies from 5 points (for the 1 of clubs) to 1 point (for the 10-15 of clubs). The first player to 50 points wins the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"168162": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.61843", "name": "Clubs", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2661": "Press Your Luck"}, "age": "8", "usersrated": "670", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"131": "Climbing Games"}}, "125925": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Moron Test: Color Reaction", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"168163": "iPhone edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1338958.png", "videogametheme": {"2351": "Puzzle"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"4443": "iPhone"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1338958_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Moron Test: Color Reaction in a very simple game.

So grab hold of the Swiss Knife of survival kits &ndash; your Nintendo WiiU controller and make every second count; you only get one chance.<br/><br/>Stay human, we are a dying breed.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/><br/>ZombiU is a first-person survival horror game set in London, in which the player assumes the role of a random survivor in the Zombie Apocalypse. The player collects various items and weapons used to fight and kill zombies that are located or looted from different areas. If the player's character is killed by a zombie, which can occur with a single bite, the character will permanently die and the player will then take the role of another random survivor. The previous character will become a zombie, whom the player must kill in order to reclaim his original inventory. If the player has Miiverse enabled, it is possible that other players' characters will also appear as zombies carrying the items they had collected. The player can also tag clues and hints onto walls that other players can see when they're on their own adventure.<br/><br/>The game's controls extensively use the features of the Wii U GamePad. During normal play, the touchscreen is used to manage the player's inventory and displays a mini-map of the immediate area, which shows the player's location and nearby items. The touchscreen is also used for context-sensitive actions, such as barricading doors or hacking combination locks. The Wii U GamePad gyroscope, which allows the controller to sense its rotation and tilt in three-dimensional space, is also utilized: while viewing the touchscreen the player may move the controller around in space to focus on and scan different areas of the area in order to find items. While performing any of these actions, the perspective on the television switches to a fixed third-person view, showing the player character and the surrounding area. In this state, the player is vulnerable to attack and must watch both the Wii U GamePad touchscreen and the television screen in order to avoid potential harm.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;ZombiU&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "125963": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Game & Wario", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"212921": "Australian Wii U edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1724404.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5420": "Wario"}, "usersrated": "6", "average": "6.16667", "videogamegenre": {"2338": "Party"}, "videogameplatform": {"10763": "Wii U"}, "videogamehonor": {"31939": "2012 Game Critics Best Social/Casual/Puzzle Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1724404_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Wario and his Diamond City friends are back in action.

The premise is that a second World War could have broken out at any time, not just September 1939, given the numerous political crises that signaled the march of fascism against the contemporary international order.<br/><br/>Each player commands one or more powers representing an ideology: Fascism (Germany/Italy/Japan), Communism (USSR) or Democracy (UK/France/US). The status quo resides with Democracy, while Communism and Fascism use political or military force to revise the world order to their liking... but once all three ideologies are fighting, another World War is on!<br/><br/>Cataclysm is designed to be playable in one long sitting (five or six hours), but with scenarios as short as 60 minutes. Components will include one 22&quot; x 34&quot; map, 456 counters (9/16&quot;), 160 wood cubes, and about 20 pages of rules. The several scenarios include start points in 1933, 1939, 1941, and 1943, covering one or both theatres, plus an &quot;intro&quot; scenario covering just the Crisis in the West from 1937-40, and &quot;alternate history&quot; options like a fascist France or war between the Soviets and the West after the fall of Germany. There will be an extensive playbook with play-throughs, examples, design notes, strategy notes, and a bibliography.<br/><br/>The game scale is army groups, fleets, and air forces, and two years per turn (with a variable number of actions). Design goals include a minimum of maneuver elements, a minimum of arbitrary constraints, and a maximum of interaction. Players must do more forward planning than is typical of strategic WWII games, but also must remain flexible to respond to events. There is no sequence of play, everything (including production) is mediated through a chit-pull mechanism. Every game is an outlier.<br/><br/>Cataclysm was submitted for publication to GMT Games in March 2013, and went up for P500 pre-order in October 2014.

It's two separate games, interlinked: the main game is a Xevious variant, using a helicopter to bomb ground targets and air missiles for air attacks, the secondary game is similiar to Gauntlet/Shamus where you are roaming around underground fortresses in search of a missing crystal segment, but making use of inventory items along the way. A kind of scavenger hunt, all of it is linked via an interface of choosing which planet would you attack in what order. You can load/save saved games via the interface. So you do a Xevious-like run topside of the planet first, bomb a control mechanism at the end, to access the Secondary Game. The Secondary Game takes place within the planets interior fortress, completion of the secondary game takes you via teleport back to your own spaceship.

It has its roots in Downtown/Elusive Victory Raid style air combat but provides that experience at a whole new level for the Solitaire Gamer.  You will be placed in charge of the &ldquo;Cactus Air Force&rdquo; defending Henderson Field from furious Japanese attacks by Air, Land and Sea.<br/><br/>Cactus Air Force covers the period from 7 Aug -15 Nov 1942 and has a card-driven mission system based on two decks of 55 cards which will drive the weather, reinforcement schedule, events and Japanese attacks.  Two campaigns each covering 45 days of real-time action will be provided.  Player can follow the historical schedule of events to see how they fare or play a random sequence of cards that will test your mettle in defending Guadalcanal. You can also game out a sequence of missions over a smaller number of days if desired.<br/><br/>Player will have to manage their resources and pilot rosters to get the maximum effort under difficult circumstances.  Pilots will have different ratings for combat and navigation skill and diseases and fatigue will have a major effect on their capabilities.  Aircraft maintenance will be a key factor on how many serviceable aircraft you have available.  While flight maneuvering and air combat will be very similar to Downtown/Elusive Victory, the player will now have some tactical decisions such as High Side Pass and other tactics to choose from when attacking enemy formations.  Coastwatchers and Radar are your means of detection and you will rely on them to allow you to get in position in time to meet the enemy raids.<br/><br/>The Map: The 34&rdquo;x22&rdquo; Map encompasses a major portion of Guadalcanal, Savo Island, Florida Island, parts of Santa Isabel Island, Russel Island and New Georgia Island. (An area roughly 98nmx135nm)<br/><br/>Order of Battle: The American OoB will include the rosters of the following units - USN VF-5/VF-6 F4F-4; VS-71,E-300,VS-3,VB-6 SBD-3;  VT-8 TBF; USMC VMF-223/224/121 F4F-4;  VMSB-232,231,141 SBD-3; USAAF 67th FS P400 and 339FS P39.   A What-if Variant will have P38s available earlier than they were historically.  Japanese forces include: Zero 21/32s, Rufes, Bettys, Petes, Mavis, Vals and Kates.<br/><br/>Missions and Targets: As leader of the Cactus Air Force, you will assign your pilots and aircraft to missions. Many will be Air Combat Missions to defend Henderson Field and the Marines on Guadalcanal from Japanese bombers, but those will not be the only taskings.  Like your historical counterpart, you will also be tasking your aircraft and aircrews to stop the infamous Tokyo Express coming down the &ldquo;Slot&rdquo; to bring reinforcements and shell your forces.  You will also target enemy ground forces as they close in on the hard pressed Marines on the ground.<br/>Ship Targets include DD, CL, CA, TR, AVL, BB, Barges.<br/><br/>Ground Targets include Supply Dumps, Troops, Seaplane Bases.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>22x34 Map<br/>3-4 Sheets of Aircraft and Misc Counters<br/>Two 55 card decks<br/>Rulebook<br/>Playbook<br/>Roster Sheets<br/>Player Aid Cards<br/>Aircraft Data Cards<br/>Dice<br/><br/>The Stars and Stripes have been hoisted over Henderson Field, Guadalcanal.

The game starts on May 13th, the third day of Case Yellow. Six panzer divisions have passed through the Ardennes and are now at the Meuse River. The French and British have raced through Belgium to reach the Dyle Line and cover the Gembloux Gap. The stage is set. Can the Germans cross the Meuse in front of strong opposition? And, if they can, will they be able to break out from the bridgeheads and advance across the map while threatened by Allied reinforcements pouring in from the north and south?<br/><br/>Dynamo: Retreat to Victory<br/><br/>This game covers the British withdrawal to Dunkirk and the evacuation. The game starts on May 24th, the day the British decide that the B.E.F. is in real danger of being cut-off from their supply base and the best option is to head for the coast at Dunkirk. However, many of the German panzer divisions are closer to Dunkirk than the British. Can the British reach the coast before the Germans? Can they hold the Dunkirk perimeter for eight days while they evacuate?<br/><br/><br/>The rules for both games highlight armor, air support, and morale.
