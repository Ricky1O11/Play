The player takes on the role of engineer Kyle Mason.  Oxygen is used as action points to move, open locked doors, restore power, etc.  The player begins on the Airlock tile.  As he or she explores the ship, additional tiles are drawn randomly and added to the ship.  These tiles provide instructions on how to further advance, reveal the items that can be found in the new room, and detail the the puzzle(s), if any, that must be solved in order to win the game.<br/><br/>In the current version, a player sheet is used to track the player's physical and mental states (which affect the player's ability to search the ship and perform various actions), as well as the player's oxygen level and inventory.  Another optional version is in development that will use chart tiles and tokens to track these things.<br/><br/>As the player explores the ship, he or she will find data cards that gradually reveal the terrible fate of the Heresy and its passengers and crew.  They also provide victory points that are key to obtaining the specific ending a player desires.

There were also action sequences that used drawn graphical elements (not captured, as seen in games such as Mean Streets by Access Software). The side-scrolling action sequence consisted of the player battling ants in tunnels. The TurboGrafx CD version did reuse the graphical elements from the computer version for the overhead battle sequences, but not for any of the character conversation segments.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this version was marred by poor quality of the video playback of the system, and the limitations of the game console hardware that resulted in side scrolling arcade sequences that were tacky in terms of gameplay.

The game has been ported to several other gaming systems since its original release.<br/><br/>The player controls a Heian period police officer (kebiishi) who must defend the capital city (Heian-ky\u014d) from an alien invasion by digging holes in the ground and filling them back up after an alien falls inside. The player scores points for every alien trapped, and the quicker the hole is filled up after the alien falls in, the higher the amount of points are scored. The aliens increase in number as the levels progress, and they can escape from holes after a certain period of time elapses or if another alien passes above their hole. The player loses if they come in contact with an alien. There is a time limit for each level, and the number of aliens increases drastically when this limit is reached, essentially preventing the player from completing the level.<br/><br/>Meldac released a Game Boy version of the game in Japan and North America in 1990. This port includes a remake version where a new type of alien appears to chase after the player's character.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Taken from the manual:<br/><br/>The time is 1,000 years ago, way back in the Heian Age.  The peaceful city of Kyo is suddenly invaded by aliens.  A kebiishi (knight of the past) is entrusted to defend the city.  He decides to confront the terrible aliens in a bold plan to bury the dreaded beasts alive.<br/><br/>People are being horribly devoured bite by bite by the aliens as they ravages down Miyako Ooji (The city's main street).  Without even a hinawaju (type of firearm) to shoot the aliens, the keibiishi has no choice but to try to bury the aliens alive.  He sets himself to the task, digging a hole on the road where the aliens are headed.<br/><br/>Then he hides and waits.  Should any alien fall into the hole, he must quickly bury it before it can climb back out.  In this game, you are to play the role of the keibiishi trying to defend the city.<br/><br/>"}, "100415": {"poll": [], "name": "GeoSafari World Challenge", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1239699_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Educational Insights"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1239699.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Educational Insights Edition 1999"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Electronic", "Trivia"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This electronic talking quiz game challenges kids with fast-paced high tech fun!

Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.<br/><br/>Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.<br/><br/>To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian first edition", "Czech first edition", "English first edition", "English Revised Printing edition 2012", "French first edition", "German edition 2012", "German Revised edition 2013", "Italian edition", "Japanese edition", "Polish edition", "Russian edition", "Spanish first edition", "Wargames Club Traditional Chinese edition"], "average": "7.01616", "name": "Elder Sign", "videogamebg": ["Elder Sign: Omens"], "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["Elder Sign: Arkham Nights 2011 Promotional Ancient One Card", "Elder Sign: Arkham Nights 2012 Promotional Ancient One Card", "Elder Sign: Arkham Nights 2013 Promotional Ancient One Card", "Elder Sign: Arkham Nights 2014 Promotional Ancient One Card", "Elder Sign: Arkham Nights 2015 Promotional Ancient One Card", "Elder Sign: Arkham Nights 2016 Promotional Ancient One Card", "Elder Sign: Gates of Arkham", "Elder Sign: Grave Consequences", "Elder Sign: Omens of Ice", "Elder Sign: Omens of the Deep", "Elder Sign: The Hand of Solace \u2013  A Location Promotional Card", "Elder Sign: The Log of the Persephone \u2013 Promo Location", "Elder Sign: Unseen Forces"], "usersrated": "15058", "boardgameaccessory": ["Elder Sign: Museum Gamemat"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Arkham Horror", "Cthulhu Mythos", "Elder Sign", "Fantasy Flight Silver Line Games", "Solitaire Games"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["004: Live Coop &amp; Improved Audio!", "1P 010 - Elder Sign", "1P 115 - Wizard\u2019s Academy", "39: Boardgame Cthulhu", "Cubepushers - Episode 2: Traitors Everywhere!", "Elder Sign", "Ep 7 - Concordia &amp; Orleans", "Episode 11 - Horror Spooktacular!", "Episode 14 - Elder Sign &amp; Comic Art Festival", "Episode 3 - Scare Tactics", "Episode 3 - Witch of Salem vs Elder Sign - Gates of Arkham", "Episode 30 - Bob and Richard and Drizzt and Michael", "Episode 33 - Belfort", "Episode 33: Space Cadets, A Look Back at 2012 and our 2013 Resolutions", "Episode 34: Fiasco and Elder Sign", "Episode 39 - Between Two Cities", "Episode 6 - Picking Over the Bones", "Episode 69 - Gen Con 2011 Wrap Up", "Episode 72 March Craziness Dice Game Style Part 1", "Episode 73 March Craziness Dice Game Style Part 2", "Episode 83-- Live from GEN CON Part 2-- from the show floor", "Episode 9: Elder Sign, The Legend of Drizzt, Analysis Paralysis and Managing Minutiae", "Episode Thirty Four :Exit Through The Gift Shop", "Episodio 5 \u2013 Elder Sign: Omens y juegos de mesa en Android", "Episodio 6 \u2013 A Touch of Evil y \u00bftema o mec\u00e1nica?", "Game Gab: Gen Con 2011: Richard Launius", "House Rules 20: A Chat About Elder Sign with Co-Designer Kevin Wilson", "I've Been Diced! episode 25: Genres that do or don't work as boardgames", "I've Been Diced! episode 27: An expanding universe of expansions", "I've Been Diced! episode 45: Noble failures, and Eclipse on the iPad", "I've Been Diced! episode 60: Making history with Microscope, and games that tell stories", "Il Giocatore - Episodio 7 - Especial Juegos Lovecraft", "Il Giocatore - Episodio 7 - Especial Juegos Lovecraft - Parte 2", "Losing Our Sanity: Our Elder Signs Gates of Arkham Review", "OBG 96: We Salute Games", "Session Impressions: Elder Sign", "Show #22: Table Scraps", "Strange Assembly 089 - The Mayans Were Wrong", "The Gaming Gang Episode 27: Arkham Horror, Outbreak Undead, Elder Sign, Undead States of America and More!", "The Gaming Gang Extra 22: Gen Con Raw!

Pazuru R\u014ddo, Adventure! Puzzle Road) was a puzzle game for the Game Boy released in June of 1990. It was one of the few games produced by the little-known software company Vic Tokai. Cover illustration by Lawrence Fletcher.  The name of the game was inspired by Daedalus, the mythical character of Greek legend who created the labyrinth.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The game is essentially a series of 36 jigsaw puzzles with Tetris-like pieces known as pentominos that must be assembled into a specific shape. The puzzles start off with rectangular shapes and simple solutions, but the puzzles quickly grow more complex, with odder shapes like a rocket ship, a gun, and even enlarged versions of some of the pentominoes themselves. Each level is timed, and once the timer is started it cannot be stopped until the level is finished. One starts off the game with only three pentomino pieces, and at the completion of each early level, a new piece is awarded to the player. At the final level, the player is given the 2x2 square O tetromino and must complete an 8x8 square puzzle.<br/><br/>After completing each level, the player was given a password to access that level at a later time. Interestingly, each password was a common English four-letter word, so that by guessing common four-letter words, players could potentially access levels they had not actually reached by playing the game.<br/><br/>From the manual:<br/><br/>In the World of Daedalus there are puzzles houses on each of the 42 islands of this very puzzling land.  On the first island there are no bridges and no ships.  When you enter the puzzle house on this island you will find 3 Daedalian blocks.  Your task is to fill up the frame in front of you with the blocks.  There can be no space remaining!  When this has been done, a bridge will appear, and you can go on to the next island.<br/><br/>However, you are in an apprentice stage until you get up to a point where you are using 12 blocks.  While in this stage, you will find three blocks at the first island.  When the sprite appears over the bridge, you will get another block and go on to next island by passing through the puzzle house.  Only when you have gotten by your apprentice stage with 12 blocks, does the real game begin!<br/><br/>You will encounter many different types of frames.  Some will be very challenging, but don't give up!  When you have mastered all the puzzles on all islands up to 41, you will be confronted by island 42, where your final task awaits you.  Here you will be presented with 13 blocks.  Good luck!<br/><br/>"}, "100454": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1016980.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Robert Hemminger"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Robert Hemminger"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Avalon Games"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1016980_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fighting", "Horror", "Print & Play"], "description": "Dept. 13 part 2: Lincoln High is the first expansion to Dept. 13.

At the start of the turn, the starting player turn over the top deck card and show the number on it.<br/><br/>If that number is equal or higher thant the number of order cards on table, another order card is drawn and placed on the table.<br/><br/>Then the starting player choose to perform one of 4 actions on his turn. He can make that action as many times as the number shown at the start of the turn:<br/><br/>-Take cards from the product deck<br/>   -Search a card from the product deck<br/>   -Discard cards from the hand<br/>   -Place products on the table to build a burger<br/><br/>Then, he can choose to deliver a burger to the customers.

El jugador puede entregar una hamburguesa que no este acabada, con la esperanza de que el cliente no se de cuenta.<br/><br/>Acto seguido, el otro jugador realiza su turno, usando el mismo numero; y al final se convierte en el jugador inicial para el siguiente turno.<br/><br/>Si en algun momento, se debe anadir un 5&ordm; pedido a la mesa, el pedido mas antiguo que hubiera en la mesa se descarta (y cualquier jugador que estuviera elaborando ese bocata, pierde los productos que tuviera en la mesa).<br/><br/>OBJETIVO<br/><br/>Cuando un jugador entrega un pedido se queda esa carta de pedido.<br/>El juego finaliza si 4 pedidos se han descartado o si se muestra el ultimo pedido del mazo.<br/>Al final de la partida, cada jugador suma los puntos de victoria de sus cartas de pedidos.

The board is initially seeded with all the stations (unlike in String Railway) placed randomly inside the boundary string and filled with two goods cubes.<br/><br/>Each turn, players must place one string that connects stations. Then players have a number of action points to use. Players start with a 3 AP locomotive, and can upgrade to better locomotives that provide up to 6 AP per turn. Action points are used to moving goods cubes (1 AP to move from station to station). If a cube reaches a station of the same colour as the cube itself, the cube is then scored.<br/><br/>White cubes are special long distance cubes. Players have mission cards that show three stations in particular order. In order to fulfill the mission, the player must move a long-distance cube through the stations in right order. The reward depends on how many stations player moves the cube through. Unfulfilled mission is worth -2. Moving the cube through one station gets rid of the penalty. Two stations gets rid of the penalty and gives the player the white cube, which is scored as a wild cube. Three stations scores 5 points on top of that.<br/><br/>After five rounds, the cubes are scored. Each set of five cubes of different colours is worth 15 points, 4-cube sets are 10 points, 3-cube sets are 6 points, 2-cube sets are 3 points and remaining single cube sets give 1 point each. White wild cubes can be very useful at this point. Unfulfilled missions are -2 points, while perfectly fulfilled missions are +5 points.<br/><br/>In addition of moving cubes, action points can be used for upgrading locomotives and replenishing goods cubes. Collected goods cubes can be discarded to gain AP. Players can also draw new mission cards and each player has a personal station they can place on board at some point in game.<br/><br/>String Railway: Transport, with a playing time of approx. 15 minutes per player, differs from the original game by adding cargo delivery and removing the values of stations. Transport is an individual game, not an expansion. The games are not compatible: you can't play String Railway with the components of Transport (the stations are different and there's no river).<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "age": "10", "name": "String Railway: Transport", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Route/Network Building"], "average": "6.89274", "usersrated": "117", "boardgamefamily": ["String System"]}, "100475": {"poll": [], "name": "Treasure Isle", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "average": "8", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Zynga"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Zynga"], "description": "Before beginning the search for treasure, the player first creates a customizable avatar.

Games of chance such as &lsquo;snakes and ladders&rsquo; and &lsquo;ludo&rsquo; can be won by anyone, but they do not offer a lot in the way of mental stimulation for those taking part and soon the thrill of being able to play a board game together as a family diminishes.<br/>More intricate family board games such as &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monopoly&rsquo; do provide the level of mental stimulation required. However, one is much more likely to win these games if one has more life experience (to be able to play strategically) and more education (knowledgeable about a subject). As a consequence younger family members, or those with self perceived lower life skills, shy away from playing these games because they always expect to get beaten.<br/><br/>In order to encourage these groups of people to join in, adults will often have to play below their best to give them a chance to win and to maintain their interest in playing the game. Whilst this is fun for a while, it soon becomes difficult for the adult to gain enough satisfaction from playing the game from the levels of satisfaction achieved by seeing their offspring&rsquo;s delight at winning.<br/><br/>How is Whirred PLAY&trade; Unique?<br/><br/>So Whirred PLAY&trade; enables everyone to play a game at their own level of skill and strategy, but whatever their level this does not determine whether or not they are more or less likely to win. Whirred PLAY&trade; is open for any number of players to join in at the same time, so unlike when playing &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; (maximum four players) or &lsquo;Monopoly&rsquo; (maximum six players), no member of the family or social group need sit on the sidelines. Everyone can join in the fun.<br/><br/>Additionally, Whirred PLAY&trade; is designed so that at all times in the game everyone always has a chance of winning, no matter their position on the board, until the eventual winner crosses the finishing line. In games such as &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monopoly&rsquo; there will come a point where it is obvious certain players are not going to win.  Some participants may decide that they will leave the game at this point and that can have a detrimental effect on the pleasure of all parties involved in playing the game. This also may become a hindrance for future participation from those who have departed early. A special feature of Whirred PLAY&trade; is an element of the game called &lsquo;Pare Up&rsquo;, especially designed to provide ample opportunity for players to bring the leader back to the chasing pack.<br/><br/>Another element of Whirred PLAY&trade; that ensures maximum interest from all parties is that any particular game should last no more than 30 minutes. &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monopoly, in particular, can run on for long periods of time and this can be a barrier for those with shorter attention spans, usually children, to want to take part. And with over 440 cards in Whirred PLAY&trade;, there is very little repetitiveness, as a typical game usually only utilises 30 to 40 cards.<br/><br/>Additionally, the game play of Whirred PLAY&trade; is designed so that everyone is participating all at the same time. No-one has to wait for any one particular player to finish their turn, which in some other family board games can often be quite a long time.<br/><br/>Whirred PLAY&trade; is Educational<br/><br/>As Whirred PLAY&trade; is based on the simple premise of spelling everyday words that just happen to be homophones, a key stage two literacy curriculum topic, it has high appeal amongst both parents and teachers as an excellent fun method of teaching children this difficult subject. Children will want to play Whirred PLAY&trade; because of all of the elements of inclusivity and equality listed above, and parents will be delighted that a game they want to play offers more than just a fun half hour.<br/><br/>Schools can utilise Whirred PLAY&trade; in formal teaching classes due to its all inclusive nature and the ability for the whole class to participate in it, with an equal chance of winning it, at the same time regardless of its size or composition. The competitive nature of Whirred PLAY&trade; especially appeals to boys, traditionally a more difficult group of students to enthuse about learning how to spell.<br/><br/>Whirred PLAY&trade; - &lsquo;The Holy Grail of Family Board Games&rsquo;<br/><br/>So Whirred PLAY&trade; really is a board game like no other. Everyone can take part, everyone has an equal chance of winning, everyone can apply their own level of strategy and utilise their own level of life experience, everyone is involved at all times, everyone can win at all times during the game, no-one gets bored, everyone gets educated and everyone has fun.<br/><br/>"}, "100015": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1012451.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Andy Hopwood"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Andy Hopwood"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hopwood Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1012451_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Racing"], "boardgamehonor": ["2012 UK Games Expo Best New Boardgame Winner"], "description": "Andy Hopwood's third game, this time round it's a push-your-luck racing game with a twist.

It uses the series rulebook, Andromeda Foundation Official Battle Manual.<br/><br/>This particular game pits the Collodian Confederation (colonial outposts of the Xenon Empire) against the Kons Empire (or Dirak of Kons). The game can be combined with The Xenon Empire's Star Wars: Crusade Against the War-Lords in some way which is not entirely clear.<br/><br/>The game-specific rulebook has a lengthy description of the background (the forces are fighting over deposits of cesium, trillium, and magellinium), discussion of strategy, and the specific rules for this game. In the latter category, there are some special weapons for each side and neutral powers which might join the war.<br/><br/>According to the rulebook, a kit was available which added extra counters to enable play of &quot;the famed Xenon-Kons Frontier Battles of the First Galactic War.&quot;<br/><br/>From a GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim):<br/><br/><br/>        This connects to the previous Game and the Collodians represent the Colonies of Xenon above. In this game for the first time a Culture meets the KONS forces directly - not merely their Allies. There are many counters in this game as the Collodians must use stealth and trickery to protect themselves. The Kons Main Fleet, as governed by the Regent and Viceroy of Cyon is beyond number in power, yet the Kons can send 5 more fleets LKIE THIS at a snap of the fingers! But the Regency is surrounded by barriers of deadly Nebula of Gasses, Radiation Forces, Clouds of Anti-Matter near the Monopole. If the Collodians can move through the Tunnels of Low Energy and strike the Regency, they can cripple it long enough so new Kons forces will have to fight for a long time to reconquer the Zone. When they do, they will have to move up the narrow corridors (like the famous pass defended by Leonidas and his 300 Spartans against the Persion Host of Darius!), likewise limit the number of Kons Craft that can attack at one time. So a Culture with good fighters though outnumbered, can win. If Xenon (on the other board) wins, help will arrive and the Kons expansion might be halted in this direction permanently. Then this would  bring Xenon a springboard for its own counter-war!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>        Xenon Export Cruisers and Collodian Fleets containing the fastest ships in the Galaxy, are included with 40 Kons war&mdash;ship counters in Imperial White.

The player has a variety of techniques, such as a flying neck throw and a back-flip.[2] The player can obtain power-ups by throwing enemies into background objects, such as street lights and dumpsters. The player fights primarily with his bare hands, although a sword can also be used for a limited time as a power-up; he can also use environmental objects as a prop from which he can deliver more powerful kicking attacks. Although the game takes place in different environments, there are primarily only five kinds of enemies, all of which appear in every level (although some levels have extra enemy types). The game is mostly remembered for its infamous continue screen (where the player character is tied to the ground underneath a descending circular saw).<br/><br/>While the game itself bears little or no connection to the later NES trilogy or Xbox revival (although the Xbox version does feature the same flying neck throw from the arcade game), certain aspects of it were carried over to the first NES title. The first stage in the NES game is a loose adaptation of the first stage in the arcade game and the opening cutscene in the NES game vaguely resembles the intro in the arcade version.

As long as it is within the rules, players have the freedom to select different actions of their characters in order to shape the direction and outcome of the game.<br/><br/>One of the players is expected to assume the role of a game master (GM). The GM creates a setting in which each player plays the role of a single character. The GM describes the game world and its inhabitants while the other players describe the intended actions of their characters. Based on this information, the GM describes the outcome of each action. Some outcomes are determined by the rule system, and some are chosen by the GM.<br/><br/>New Horizon is a table top RPG. While the D20 tabletop system is the most popular, New Horizon uses an exciting new rule system called Vo|t.

The emperor promised riches and glory to the hero who could defeat the dragon. Many brave warriors tried. All failed. The few who survived brought back tales of the dragon's magical <br/>shape-shifting. Whenever a warrior seemed to gain the upper hand in pitched battle, the dragon changed shape: sometimes a turtle, a bear, a butterfly -- there seemed to be no limit to the dragon's magic.<br/><br/>One afternoon in Spring, a humble farmboy named Mah Jongg was carrying eggs to the village market. A man with a gray beard and a long white pigtail appeared from behind a rock. &quot;Young man,&quot; said the Wlse One, &quot;not far from here there lives the evil dragon. Go to its den and grab hold of the scaled back. The <br/>dragon will change form. No matter what happens, no matter how frightened you become, do not let go your hold until the dragon surrenders to you. Only good will come of this.&quot; Then the old man vanished as suddenly as he appeared.<br/><br/>Mah Jongg did as the Old One said. He sneaked into the dragon's den and took hold of the dragon's scaled back. The surprised dragon immediately changed into a hawk with a sharp beak and tearing talons. The boy did not let go. The dragon changed into a beautiful butterfly, a slippery fish, and a hungry bear. Still <br/>Mah Jongg held on. Even when the dragon took the forms of a poisonous spider and a snapping turtle, the brave farm boy held tightly to its back. Finally, exhausted, the dragon returned to its original form and surrendered to the boy.<br/><br/>From that time on, the dragon brought nothing but good luck and great harvests to the people of the province, Mah Jongg most of all.<br/><br/>Years later, the game of Shanghai was developed to remind the people of this event. It is said that anybody who can solve the puzzle in all its forms will receive a piece of the Luck of the Dragon.

Additionally, West Virginia and surrounding states in Appalachia had a large reserve of natural resources which would form the revenue stream for the C&amp;O for years to come.<br/><br/>Your object is to mimic (and beat) the C&amp;O's success.<br/><br/>The game starts with the player taking a loan for money to pay for track and locomotives to haul goods.  Play consists of rolling dice for each commodity in the board.  Some commodities such as coal are more plentiful than manufactured goods.  After the commodities are placed, track is built, link by link, using the railroad's treasury.  Locomotives may be purchased which have a range of anywhere from 5-10 links.  After this is complete, if a player is able, he may transport cubes to any market expecting them.<br/><br/>There are also markets in the game which decide the price of a commodity based on how often it is delivered and how often cubes are placed on the board.  These values are staggered for different cities.<br/><br/>For those who have played a number of train games, this game could be described as a cross between Silverton and Age of Steam with a little bit of Prairie Railroads thrown in for good measure.  The main challenge of this title was to create a compelling solitaire railroading experience.  The game is extremely difficult to beat.

The elements are \u5730 (earth), \u706b (fire), \u98a8 (wind), and \u6c34 (water).  Depending on how you combine the elements determines what style of attack you have available.  Most unique combinations of 1, 2, or 3 elements produce a different attack style, and using the best suited weapon for a given situation can help the player considerably.  After the opening story animation, there is quite a lengthy description of every combination of orbs showing how the different weapon styles operate.  The orbs can also be ejected as a bomb, which covers most of the screen area when used.<br/><br/>Each level has an end boss (and some have a mid-point boss as well) and each boss typically has multiple phases of attack as portions get destroyed.<br/><br/>Your ship gets destroyed any time an enemy shot hits you, you run into an enemy, or you run into a part of the scenery that happens to be at the same height as your ship.  Any time your ship is destroyed, the elemental orbs that you were using are scattered on the screen.  The screen keeps on scrolling and a new ship reappears after a couple of seconds, if the player has any remaining.  If you were not too close to the bottom of the screen, you have a chance to reclaim some or all of the previous elemental orbs.  It is also possible to catch a power-up that acts as a shield and allows your ship to take one hit without being destroyed.<br/><br/>The standard game has four difficulty options: Normal, Hard, Super Hard, and Unbelievable.  The differences in each difficulty mostly have to do with the number of foes on the screen, number of enemy shots fired, and speed at which the enemy shots fly towards your ship.  As the game is completed with the difficulty setting set higher and higher, the ending sequence is more complete.  The &quot;Unbelievable&quot; setting is well named.<br/><br/>In addition to the standard game, there is a challenge mode with options for speed and points.  The speed challenge times you on how quickly you can attain the target score of 1,000,000 points.  The points challenge is a race to see how many points you can score in 2 minutes.  Both challenges add an additional orb type that scores points, with each additional orb collected scoring twice as many points as the previous one.<br/><br/>Taken from the manual:<br/><br/>\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30d0\u30e9\u306e\u91ce\u671b\u3092\u7cbe\u970a\u306e\u529b\u3067\u6253\u3061\u7815\u3051\uff01<br/><br/>GAME STORY<br/><br/>\u9b54\u6cd5\u3068\u7cbe\u970a\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u3002 \u3072\u3068\u308a\u306e\u738b\u306e\u51fa\u73fe\u4ee5\u6765\u3001\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u30d0\u30e9\u5e1d\u56fd\u306f\u6b21\u3005\u306b\u4ed6\u56fd\u3078\u306e\u4fb5\u7565\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u305f\u3002 \u305d\u306e\u91ce\u671b\u306b\u6297\u3057\u3066\u7acb\u3061\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u305f\u306e\u304c\u7cbe\u970a\u56fd\u5bb6\u30b7\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002<br/><br/>\u30b7\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u306f\u7cbe\u92ed\u306e\u7cbe\u970a\u7532\u5175\u90e8\u968a\u306b\u51fa\u6483\u3092\u547d\u3058\u305f\u3002 \u7cbe\u970a\u7532\u5175\u3068\u306f\u3001\u642d\u4e57\u8005\u306e\u30a8\u30ec\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u3067\u7cbe\u970a\u306e\u529b\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3001\u8d77\u52d5\u3059\u308b\u88c5\u7532\u6226\u58eb\u3060\u3002 \u305d\u3093\u306a\u7cbe\u970a\u7532\u5175\u306e\u90e8\u968a\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u3001\u6700\u5f37\u3092\u8a87\u308b\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u6226\u58eb\u3001\u305d\u308c\u304c\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30ac\u30f3\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002<br/><br/>[translation]<br/><br/>Break the ambition of Buraizubara with the power of spirit!<br/><br/>GAME STORY<br/><br/>Jura, the world of magic and spirits.

At the ball, one more bit of business needs to be settled &ndash; each aristocrat has bet a parcel of land that he can curry the most favor from the seven sisters over the course of the party! With their land and honor on the line, each aristocrat is rushing to gain the favor of the daughters, and to cast derision on his opponents.<br/><br/>In Seven Sisters, a hand-management, area-control Euro-style board game, the players play the roles of wealthy aristocrats who are trying to gain the favor of the king's seven daughters, who happen to be named after the seven deadly sins: Wrath, Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Sloth, Pride, and Envy.<br/>  <br/>The game consists of four rounds, with the players being dealt six cards each round. Using five of the six cards, players influence the sisters by sending servants to do the sisters' bidding. Multiple options when playing each card create opportunities for players to use both strategic and tactical play to influence the sisters more than their opponents do.<br/><br/>Each round after cards are played, scoring occurs with each sister granting her favor (victory point) and a special reward or action to the player who has influenced her most that round. These rewards and actions are thematically tied to the name of the sister (e.g., Greed rewards players with gold). Gaining this favor is important not only for the victory point, but also to gain advantages and resources for following rounds.<br/><br/>After four rounds are played and scored, another scoring round happens immediately. Victory points are tallied, including bonus points for having gained the favor of all seven sisters and for having the highest quantity of unused resources remaining (gold, fruit, and servants).

DCC RPG has been in &quot;silent playtest&quot; mode for well over a year. Now, after many months of preliminary testing, the rules are ready for a public stress test.<br/><br/>The enclosed file is not the complete text of DCC RPG; rather, it is an excerpt. This file has the rules that are most pertinent to starting a game and running a short campaign. The finished DCC RPG includes many more spells and monsters, rules for characters up to level 10, as well as a much more robust judge's section. In fact, it&rsquo;s a more well-rounded work in general. However, for &quot;kicking the tires&quot; and just testing out the core rules, you don't need the complete work. Everything you need for a test run is enclosed herein.<br/><br/>Remember, the book you hold in front of you is only part of the finished whole. (Well, part of the still-to-be-finished whole - we are still transcribing the final manuscript!) You may find references to sections of the rules that are not included here. Don't worry; for now, you can ignore those references. They will be resolved in the final printed version. The final printed version will also include complete artwork and a final layout.<br/><br/>We strongly encourage you to provide feedback on this work! This document is not the final rules set for DCC RPG. DCC RPG has already changed, thanks to feedback from the hundreds of gamers who have stress-tested it over the last few years. We anticipate it will change again after this beta is reviewed and played by thousands of gamers. The game will change based on YOUR feedback.<br/><br/>Speaking of changing rules, the author has been tweaking the playtest rules as the editor does his work. (In fact, I added this paragraph to the intro after Aeryn finished his edit - he hasn't seen it! Hope I don&rsquo;t make any typos. - Joseph) The thief, cleric, and halfling classes were changed mid-edit. All the rules will continue to evolve based on YOUR feedback, but please be aware that our fearless editor isn't to blame if you find errors in this document - they're probably from the last-minute changes made as this living document continues to integrate playtest feedback.<br/><br/>"}, "100200": {"rpgartist": ["Marko Djurdjevi\u0107", "Marcio Fiorito", "Santiago Iborra", "Mark Jelfo", "Veronica Jones", "Lief Jones", "Socar Myles", "Gabe Pena", "Kevin Porter", "Scott Purdy", "Hian Rodriguez", "Alex Sheikman", "Mattias Snygg", "David Wong"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Dark Inheritance (Spycraft)", "rpgdesigner": ["Alex Flagg", "Scott Gearin", "Cameron Haigh", "Gareth Hanrahan", "Chad Justice", "Jason Olsan", "Aaron Rosenberg", "Karl Surber", "Wil Upchurch", "Sam Witt"], "rpgproducer": ["Alex Flagg", "Scott Gearin", "Scott Holden", "Chad Justice", "Judy Justice", "Stephanie Justice", "Mandy Smith", "Jeremy Tibbs"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1013391.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "10", "rpgissuearticle": ["Game Reviews"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Multiverse", "Mythology / Folklore"], "rpgpublisher": ["Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG)", "Mythic Dream Studios"], "rpg": ["Spycraft"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1013391_t.jpg", "description": "From Back Cover:<br/><br/><br/>What Secrets Will You Uncover...<br/><br/>Ungodly horrors crawl within an abandoned gene-splicing lab and deadly wonders lay hidden beneath a murdered city, shattered by a catastrophe that defies explanation.

A game will usually end when all but one of the players has been defeated, although there are some minor differences depending on which victory condition is selected. Most buildings and units are created by spending resources, while some buildings and units can also be summoned by certain units.<br/><br/>There are twelve different playable races, each with its own strengths, weaknesses and resource dependencies. There are roughly a hundred and forty controllable units which will fight and, in some cases, build buildings.<br/><br/>The game also features some basic role-playing elements including leveling-up characters and completing optional quests. In addition to these units, the player controls a Hero which they have created before playing. The Hero is a unique unit which, as well as being able to fight and build buildings, can cast spells and receive quests. Depending on the outcome of a battle, the Hero will receive experience points and level up, as is common in many role-playing games.<br/><br/>There are two main game modes: the campaign and skirmish mode. The campaign is non-linear, with a goal of conquering the entire continent of Etheria (the land in which the game is set). Skirmish games can be played against computer-controlled enemies and other human players. All the game modes and victory conditions available in the campaign are playable, as well as some multiplayer-only modes.

This is done at the beginning of the game while giving a tutorial of what controls will be needed during future stages.<br/><br/>The main part of the game takes place in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory where the Oompa Loompas help the player through each level. By giving them commands Charlie finishes each challenge and progresses through the game. Each Oompa Loompa specializes in different tasks, such as electrical work, harvesting and welding. Candy is scattered throughout the levels and when collected it boosts Charlie's energy.<br/><br/>Each level is very similar to the plot in the 2005 movie. For example, Charlie must help Willy Wonka remove the gluttonus Augustus Gloop from the pipe above the chocolate river. He must roll the blueberry Violet Beauregarde to the Juicing Room and juice her. When Veruca Salt is thrown down the garbage chute, the player's objective is to follow her down the chute and save her from the incinerator. The last objective of the game is after Mike Teavee shrinks himself the player needs to fix the television-chocolate machine. Throughout the game the Oompa Loompas must help Charlie return the chocolate factory back to normal by fixing the mistakes that the self-indulgent children made.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (video games)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "100247": {"boardgamedesigner": ["P.

The basic game mechanism is a kind of reverse werewolf/mafia game where the secret character, The Doctor, is the only person who can&rsquo;t kill anyone and has to survive on wits and confusion alone.<br/><br/>Background: (Or buy the DVD and watch it!)<br/>Human soldiers and the mysterious headless monks are working together in an uneasy alliance. They have kidnapped The Doctor&rsquo;s companion (Amy Pond) and taken her to the asteroid know a Demon&rsquo;s Run. The Doctor arrives on the asteroid disguised as one of the monks but reveals himself and demands Amy&rsquo;s return. The lights go out and then back on, all orchestrated by the doctor, of course. Now the soldiers are stood there facing the monks. The soldiers know that one of the monks is their feared enemy, The Doctor, determined to foil their plans. All they have to do is to work out which monk is The Doctor in disguise and shoot him before he escapes. But if they shoot the wrong monk they will feel the wrath of their allies and be killed themselves by the monks dying blast. The monks themselves know that the soldiers are trigger happy and might shoot them. It might be best for them to zap any of the trigger happy soldiers before they themselves are killed - at least the other soldiers would know that they were a monk and not The Doctor. But the monks&rsquo; plan needs the soldiers and if they lose all of their soldiers then their plans will fail and The Doctor will triumph. The soldiers and monks need to act quickly before The Doctor is able to escape. The scene is set for the Demon&rsquo;s Run Standoff.<br/><br/>The Game:<br/>The players take on the role of soldiers, headless monks and The Doctor through a series of standoffs. During each standoff: the soldiers try to kill The Doctor; the monks try to direct the soldiers to The Doctor, and The Doctor just tries to survive. At the end of the standoff, points are given to players whose characters are still alive.<br/><br/>"}, "100257": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jake Richmond"], "rpgitemversion": ["JPEG Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Lets use Panty Explosion Perfect to play Jedi Academy", "rpgartist": ["Jake Richmond"], "rpgproducer": ["Jake Richmond"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1013423.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Star Wars"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)", "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Atarashi Games"], "rpg": ["Tokyo Brain Pop"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "rpgseries": ["Lets use Panty Explosion Perfect to play..."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1013423_t.jpg", "description": "Designer's Description:<br/><br/>I hear this a lot: &quot;Gee Jake, Panty Explosion sounds really neat and I really like the mechanics but I can't get any of my friends to try it and Japanese school girls are weird and really I'd rather play Fill in the blank&quot;.<br/><br/>I get that.

They were elite warriors, charged with defending the strongholds from the many enemies of the dwarven people: the orc tribes of the north, the goblins from beneath the ground, and the various monsters and savage beasts that roamed the wilderness.<br/><br/>For the most part, they were highly successful. On only one occasion did the fortresses of the dwarf people become compromised, and that was mainly due the corrupting and poisonous magic of the goblins causing illness in many of the Stoneguard. But even then, they were able to overcome this and eject the goblins from their home.<br/><br/>All of this changed at the start of the Age of Darkness and Nightmares. The orc hordes attacked on masse, the goblins found new and powerful magics, and demons and undead monstrosities added to the dwarven problems. Slowly, one by one, the dwarven fortresses began to fall.<br/><br/>The Stoneguard, being the first line of defence for the dwarven people, were blamed for not defending their homes properly. They became maligned amongst their own people even though, in the face of overwhelming odds, they never once faltered or fled, laying down their lives for their homes.<br/><br/>Today, the Stoneguard continue to defend the last two dwarven fortresses left standing from their enemies. They do so with skill, bravery and resolution. Some Stoneguard have left their ancestral homes, traveling out into the wider world in the hopes of finding some sort of aid for the dwarfs. What they have found has left them in despair, yet they continue to fight, never giving up on the hope that, one day, the will push the darkness back and a new age of light will begin.<br/><br/>"}, "100293": {"videogame": ["Lemmings"], "poll": [], "name": "Playstation Network Collection - Puzzle Pack", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU PSP edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1016897.png", "videogametheme": ["Puzzle"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Cohort Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["PSP"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "videogamecompilation": ["Lemmings"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1016897_t.png", "description": "User Summary:<br/>Playstation Network Collection - Puzzle Pack is a set of three different puzzle games released by Microsoft in 2008.

The winner with the best record after four races is the champion badger!<br/><br/>Full rules may be found on wiki.decktet.com<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "8", "name": "If Badger was a Bunny", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Trick-taking"], "average": "5.83333", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Badgers", "Animals: Rabbits", "Animals: Turtles", "Climbing Games", "Decktet Games", "Shedding Games"]}, "100322": {"rpgdesigner": ["Michael Banks", "Len Neufeld"], "rpgitemversion": ["US Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Ultraheroes", "rpgartist": ["Steve Fastner", "Dennis Francis"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1080211.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Be an Interplanetary Spy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Bantam Books"], "rpgcategory": ["Solitaire Adventure"], "rpggenre": ["Kid-Friendly"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1080211_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>You are the hero of your own science fiction adventure!<br/><br/>Can you find the traitor in the galaxy's newest superteam?<br/><br/>Or help defeat Kort, enemy of Spy Center?<br/><br/>You make the decisions!<br/><br/>"}, "100323": {"rpgartist": ["Darrel Anderson", "Steve Fastner"], "rpgitemversion": ["US Softcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Planet Hunters", "rpgdesigner": ["Seth McEvoy"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1080213.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Be an Interplanetary Spy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Bantam Books"], "rpgcategory": ["Solitaire Adventure"], "rpggenre": ["Kid-Friendly"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1080213_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>You are the hero of your own science fiction adventure!<br/><br/>Can you infiltrate the starship of the world's most dangerous villains?<br/><br/>Or survive the dangers of an aquatic frontier?<br/><br/>You make the decisions!<br/><br/>"}, "100324": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Fantasy Handouts: Menus", "rpgdesigner": ["Philip Reed"], "rpgproducer": ["Christopher Shy"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1014709.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Ronin Arts"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Fantasy Handouts"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1014709_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Menus, the latest release in the series, presents three menus that GMs can use for inns and taverns in their campaign.

A paddle controller rotates through a fixed arc (usually about 330 degrees); it has a stop at each end.<br/><br/>Atari 2600 Paddle controllers come in pairs both connecting to a single controller port. These controllers also rotate just under one full rotation before hitting a hard stop. Finally, they have a picture of a tennis racquet and the word &quot;paddle&quot; on it. Because two controllers connect to each port and the 2600 has two controller ports, four players simultaneously can play in games that support it.<br/><br/>Design<br/><br/>The paddle wheel is usually mechanically coupled to a potentiometer, so as to generate an output voltage level varying with the wheel's angle relative to a fixed reference position. A paddle is thus an absolute position controller. That is, without any previous knowledge, the sensor can be read and the result directly indicates the position of the paddle knob. This is in contrast to a quadrature encoder-based device or &quot;spinner&quot;.<br/><br/>Games<br/><br/>Some famous video games using paddles are Pong, Breakout, and Night Driver. The reason for the name paddles for this type of game controller is that the first game that used it, Pong, was a video game simulation of table tennis, whose racquets are commonly called paddles. Even though the simulated paddles appeared on-screen (as small line segments), it was the hand controllers used to move the line segments that actually came to bear the name.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Paddle (game controller)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "100333": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1045983.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Kinetic"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Sebastian Coenen"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1045983_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Educational"], "description": "Pass safely through the traffic!
