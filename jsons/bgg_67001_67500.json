On one level this is good - it frees the characters and GM to do what they want and not have to keep track of things and roll dice every time something comes up. On the other hand, Discordians sometimes find enjoyment in complexity. Pick and choose the optional rules that work for your group (or mood). It is not out of the question for some people in the group to play with optional rules in effect while others do not.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        All known rules ever introduced to the game by Meta-Technicians are still in effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Players should attempt to choose clich&eacute;s that they will be able to roleplay. For example, if you are unfamiliar with Conspiracy Theories, you should not choose &quot;Paranoid&quot; as a clich&eacute;, or it you do, research it a bit in real life.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Every player automatically gets the clich&eacute; &quot;Pope&quot; (since every man, woman and child is a Pope). A Pope&rsquo;s chief weapon is surprise... Surprise and fear... fear and surprise... Their two weapons are fear and surprise... and ruthless efficiency... Their three weapons are fear, and surprise, and ruthless efficiency... and an almost fanatical devotion to Eris... Their four... no... Amongst their weapons... Hmf... Amongst their weaponry... are such elements as fear, surprise... and nice red uniforms.

The War (&quot;TW&quot;) is a hex-and-counter strategic-level game which aims to provide the challenge of a monster game with the ease of play of a moderate complexity war game. Experienced players should be able to play a campaign game in a weekend.<br/><br/>The game includes several scenarios designed to be fun, challenging mini-games in their own right, each playable in an afternoon. An array of variants and optional rules offers enough scope to make TW most replayable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from Compass Games website)The War: Europe 1939-1945 (TW) is Compass Games&rsquo; new WWII strategic level game combining all the best features of the genre into an intuitive, challenging new game. While offering all the expansive features of the WWII Monster Game genre (such as U-Boat warfare, diplomacy, espionage, strategic bombing, jets, rockets and numerous variants for each Major Power), TW also offers tremendous scope in its 12 scenarios (see below).<br/><br/>Although not a card driven game (and thus a good candidate for solitaire play), TW includes card play for the U-Boat War, Strategic Bombing, Espionage and Counter Espionage and naval warfare. The cards add elements of bluff and surprise more traditional hex-and-combat-table games cannot. But they&rsquo;re optional, so TW can be played solitaire in a way CDG&rsquo;s and block games cannot. Between two (or more) skilled players, no two games are ever likely to be the same. For multiplayer games, up to five gamers can play Campaign Games as Italy, Germany, France, the U.S., Britain and USSR.<br/><br/>For the hard-core military and naval history buff, TW addresses the details of WWII strategy: what if the Germans really built the carrier Graf Zeppelin; what if Mussolini had upgraded the quality of Italian forces; what if Stalin hadn&rsquo;t shot many of his best generals during the purges; what if the U.S. had entered the war earlier&hellip;or later; what if the British had been able to mobilize the Empire and the Dominions more effectively; what if the U.S. had developed the atomic bomb early enough to use in Europe, and so on.<br/><br/>Although the game is the result of extensive research by its designer, TW isn&rsquo;t a simulation and isn&rsquo;t intended to be. It&rsquo;s a &quot;gamer&rsquo;s game&quot; with quick, user-friendly combat systems on land, in the air and at sea. Veteran gamers familiar with classic WWII strategic level games should pick up the game very quickly. For new recruits, the short scenarios teach the basics, but can be played as stand-alone games in their own right. Both realistic and playable, TW should present a rewarding challenge for any WWII strategy game buff.<br/><br/>Scenario List for The War: Europe 1939-1945:<br/><br/>    1939 Full War Campaign<br/>    1941 Campaign<br/>    1942-43 Turning Point Campaign<br/>    Poland 1939<br/>    Norway 1940<br/>    France 1940<br/>    Barbarossa 1941<br/>    North Africa 1941-43<br/>    The Atlantic Lifeline 1939-45<br/>    Bolshevik Hordes 1944-45<br/>    Regia Marina<br/>    D-Day to VE Day 1944-45<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Complexity: High (about 8 out of 10)<br/>Playing Time: 50 hours for full campaign (1.5 hours and up for scenarios)<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Good<br/><br/>Designer: Ernie Copley<br/>Developer: Paul Shackleton<br/>Artist: Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    2 maps<br/>    9 full sheets of 5/8&rdquo; counters<br/>    Approximately 20 full color 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cards with various displays, tracks, reminders, tables, charts, worksheets, etc.<br/>    1 rules booklet<br/>    1 scenario booklet<br/>    1 deck of variant cards<br/>    2 dice<br/>    1 full color box and lid &ndash; the big 3&rdquo; deep box<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "name": "The War: Europe 1939-1945", "playingtime": "1080", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["The War: Europe 1939-1945 \u2013 Expansion Kit"], "usersrated": "44", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "average": "6.86591"}, "67085": {"rpgartist": ["Lorelle Ahlstrom", "Jolly R.

Braff and Pauchon at an international archaeology conference in Geneva, who want to know the truth about the enticing rumour.<br/><br/>Later that day, sitting in front of a roaring fire after a fine meal finished off with Cuban cigars and a few brandies, the two Swiss scientists listen enthralled by the unfolding plans of their German colleagues. To a man they clamour their unanimous assent and it is decided to join forces and go back to Tikal. Appointments are made, patrons are found, equipment is assembled, notes are compared, and then they are off.<br/><br/>An uneventful journey takes them to Guatemala, and then on to the old site.

Collecting and delivering treasures is one, and having the majority in some rooms or exploring the main temple as well as an outer secret chamber, are others.<br/><br/>Tikal II calls for careful planning, as your scientist can't move freely within the temple without specific items, and tension, as the actions around the board grow scarce.

Each player starts with a hand of cards and the object is to be the first to get rid of all your cards by playing combinations.<br/><br/>The game consists of playing combinations of cards: single cards, sets, single sequences and multiple sequences. When a player plays a combination, only a combination of the same type, length and higher rank can beat it - to beat a single sequence you must play a single sequence of the same length with higher ranking cards. Jokers are wild cards and can be used in any combinations. The Twos play a special role in this game and can be seen as semi-wild cards.<br/><br/>The player who gets rid of his cards first gets two points, the second player gets one point.

Each player draws one Relationship Card at the start of the game, which describes some advantage gained due to how the investigator to your left is related to you.

No matter how you're related, these will bring a more interesting back-story to your game, involving your characters in more ways than ever before.<br/> Finally, The Lurker at the Threshold introduces the Dark Pact deck, which will tempt foolish investigators to enter into a terrible arrangement with the Lurker itself. Although these Dark Pacts may grant your investigator enhanced abilities, there is sure to be a cost.

As its an historical setting what would be the point me spending hours rewriting Wikipedia&rsquo;s Norse myth and Viking history pages for you, you can do that for yourself, or just make it up from what you&rsquo;ve learnt from the films, comic books and other popular culture avenues open to you.

As The Incal spun off successful sequels, the Metabaron became so popular that Jodorowsky began work on a story that would trace the history of the Metabarons' bloodline. The result was the comic book series, &quot;The Metabarons.&quot;<br/><br/>This supplement, &quot;Metabarons RPG Guidebook #1: Path of the Warrior,&quot; is the second follow-up to the Metabarons Roleplaying Game Rulebook, released in March, 2001. As in the Metabarons RPG and the original Star Wars RPG, the authors suggest that you do not necessarily play one of the major characters, and instead weave your campaigns around the rich subplots and supporting characters that populate the stories. To that end, they naturally recommend mining the Metabarons comics or trade paperback collections for ideas and source material to fully enhance your game.<br/><br/>"}, "67245": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Baltimore-Opoly", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Baltimore (Maryland, USA)", "Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic670370_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Late for the Sky Production Company"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic670370.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Late for the Sky Production Company edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Negotiation"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "From the Late for the Sky Website:<br/><br/>We chose some favorite landmarks and traditions, mixed in some crab cakes, great parks, a few festivals, the arts, some BIG FUN... and voil&agrave; (vw&auml; l&auml;)-behold; BALTIMORE-OPOLY!<br/>Grab Some Friends and Gather 'Round!

Victory points can be gained while exploring, by locating human survivors in pacticular.<br/><br/>And one player takes control over SkyNet forces. They have to either destroy all resistance units or to find and kill all survivors (which are usually found by resistance itself). SkyNet can also explore territory just to find anything usefull for Resistance and destroy it for nothing.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, one random map token is placed for every map area hidden. Later these tokens can be explored with different results. One SkyNet factory and a few units placed in one of six ruined cities. Resistance starts in 3 different random cities. Human units are generally weaker than SkyNets' (both sides have 4 types) but better for exploration and interception.<br/><br/>Movement, exploration and other actions can be done by playing action cards from hand. Cards also can be traded for new cards.<br/><br/>Combat can be initiated either using specific cards or when units of one side enter area with enemy forces (interception takes place if defender desires). In both cases initiator gets first shot using dice, then remaining units fire back once.

Each hex represents 200 metres or 218 yards of terrain (Alma 250 metres or 273 yards), each game turn corresponds to 20-30 minutes of real time.<br/><br/>Infantry is represented by battalions and light infantry companies, cavalry by regiments (sometimes divided into two counters), artillery by batteries (classified by weight).<br/><br/>Each game turn is divided into phases:<br/>1)Command phase &ndash; players use their Commanders-in-Chief and dispatch riders to give orders to subordinate commanders.<br/>2)Activation phase &ndash; after determining the initiative, players, using the Activation Markers, choose the division to activate. Activated units, move, fire, commence melee combat and reorganise disorganised units. The opponent can react by firing or counterattacking<br/>3)Reorganisation phase &ndash; players reorganise broken units<br/><br/>The principle of the game is based on an order system, which is associated with target hexes. The player must carry out the assigned order (of course, he gives them to himself), until the order is changed by the Commander-in-Chief, or the division commander manages to change it by himself. The order must be associated with a target hex (i.e attack hex, defend hex). The possible orders are: ATTACK, DEFEND, FORCED MARCH.<br/><br/>The game tries to present the diversity of combatants tactics mainly through unit formations. And so &ndash; Russian infantry can fight in company or closed columns, French infantry in closed columns or lines and the British infantry only in lines. Each side can form squares, and can use skirmishers. The French Eastern Army excels in light infantry tactics due to it&rsquo;s many formations of such units (chasseurs, zouaves, algerian tiraillieurs).<br/><br/>The game treats the concept of  zone of control differently from other games &ndash; it gives up the obligation to stop moving the unit in the enemy ZOC. The ZOC is a phenomenon that allows to fire or initiate close combat, and it is dependent on the units formation and the range of its firearms.<br/><br/>Unit movement doesn&rsquo;t differ from other hex-and-counter systems.<br/><br/>The game discerns fire combat and melee combat. The fire combat takes into consideration the following aspects:<br/>1)firing unit strength<br/>2)firing unit formation (skirmishers)<br/>3)target formation<br/>4)distance to target<br/><br/>Fire combat is initiated at the cost of movement points in the unit&rsquo;s activation phase, and once as a reaction for the enemy&rsquo;s doings. Fire combat is based on the unit&rsquo;s morale modifier, which is a combination of unit&rsquo;s morale, training and other &ldquo;psychological&rdquo; factors. Fire combat effects in loss of  endurance, disorganisation and in critical cases, breaking of the attacked unit. Losing movement point is also the effect of fire combat.<br/><br/>Artillery fire combat is constructed similarly to infantry fire combat &ndash; it only takes into account the differences in range and firepower of guns.<br/><br/>As a rule, to initiate melee combat, the unit must fight in a compact formation (column, line) or be a cavalry unit. Starting combat requires for a attacking unit to posses sufficient movement points after moving (a marker is placed, on the unit that meets that condition). Melee combat is also based on the unit&rsquo;s morale, strength, formation, also the terrain and attacks from the flank or the unit&rsquo;s rear. Effects of melee combat are disorganisation (also of the attacking unit) or breakdown and taking flight. Cavalry combat also includes the unit&rsquo;s momentum &ndash; which is taken from the type of the unit (heavy, lancers, light cavalry). Cavalry may react by counter-charging.<br/><br/>The loss of unit&rsquo;s endurance during the game is marked on special tables. The use of tables intents to show precisely the diverse levels of combat losses.<br/><br/>"}, "67273": {"rpgartist": ["Liz Danforth", "David R. Deitrick", "Earl Geier", "Rick Harris", "William H.

Second, dungeon crawl games often take a very long time to play due to a lot of dice rolling. TowerRun attempts to minimize this by eliminating dice rolling wherever possible, including during combat. The (hopeful) end result is not only a faster game, but a more strategic method of play. Third, there is a built in &ldquo;score&rdquo; system that single or multiple players can attempt to beat whenever they play. The game is not designed to be &ldquo;beaten&rdquo; on the first attempt, so multiple attempts are necessary, and each time you can try and beat your previous high score. Finally, a core mechanic of the game revolves around random pairings of objects and enchantments. Quite often objects have unknown enchantments that can be revealed in a calculated or risky method. Players do not know what the enchantments are until they use the item, but if they use the item without first identifying it they run the risk of it being cursed.<br/><br/>These mechanics make for heightened tension, faster game play, and a depth of balance and strategy.<br/><br/>"}, "67314": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic720545.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1905", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["John R.

Salem, Mass.: Parker Bros., Inc., 1905.<br/><br/>The Wogglebug Game of Conundrums is a formalized guessing game, a contest of wit and skill in which players take turns asking riddles. The player that cannot answer loses.<br/><br/>The &quot;What Did the Woggle-Bug Say? Contest&quot; made this Oz character a household name and inspired all kinds of novelties. That was the beginning of a &quot;Woggle-Bug&quot; craze.<br/><br/>Parker Brothers quickly produced their own tie-in for the hype, introducing The Wogglebug Game of Conundrums the same year. The Wogglebug Game of Conundrums is a game of riddles (none having to do with Oz) produced in 1905.<br/><br/>This is the first toy connected to the Land of Oz as it predates The Wonderful Game of OZ. This unauthorized novelty was only in production for a short time, and is the oldest Oz toy to be found.<br/><br/>Neither Baum nor his book The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904) are mentioned anywhere on this game.<br/><br/>The complete game consisted of a chromolithographed box containing a set of 51 gray colored Conundrum cards and 51 buff-colored Answer cards with one page &quot;Rules for Playing The Woggle Bug Game&quot; and Parker Bros. flyer for two other card games, Pit and Quit .<br/><br/>Sampled below are some of the Woggle Bug's silly questions, and the corresponding answer cards for the game. Popular Culture themes of the time were referenced, as seen in the answer to &quot;What was Adam's favorite popular song?&quot;<br/><br/>Some examples of the Conundrums (questions relying for their effects on punning in either the question or the answer) are:<br/><br/> Why didn't the dog want to go into the Ark?<br/>Because he had a bark of his own.<br/><br/>With what would you fill a barrel to make it lighter than when it was empty?<br/>Holes.<br/><br/>What was Adam's favorite popular song?<br/>&quot;There's only one girl in the world for me.&quot;<br/><br/>What kind of medicine does the iceman take?<br/>Pond's extract.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that the colorful design of the box cover did not extend to the playing cards. <br/>As this was an unauthorized game, Parker Brothers might

Your goal in NER is to have more assets than other players at game end, as determined by cash in hand, cost of businesses owned, special routes completed and state subsidies acquired.<br/><br/>The game lasts at most 16 rounds. Each round players forecast the upcoming economic condition &ndash; depression, normal or prosperity &ndash; for a future turn, then take care of any events that occur, such as &quot;Improved Bridge Building Techniques&quot; that allow players to build across estuaries or &quot;Sheep Boom Goes Bust&quot; which represents the decreased demand for wool from New England farmers as the century progressed. Four of the first five events are fixed and represent historical activities, while the other events &ndash; including devastating floods, snow, and an improved business climate &ndash; are randomized into a face-down deck. Players then each draft a business or action card, with the option to play it immediately (thereby gaining a free action) if they choose to pay the cost.<br/><br/>During the subsequent development phase, players take two actions in turn order, either building twice, playing cards twice, or doing each action once. Players want to build depots that connect their businesses to one of the major markets in the area: New York, Boston or Montreal; to do so, they need to pay the track costs as well as the cost of the depots themselves. Players can build multiple depots in the same action, but the cost is higher since they're doing more work in the same amount of time. Once a business is connected, it earns the owner more income each turn since it's now supplying a larger, richer market. The cards allow players to start new businesses, play special actions, claim a special route (which generates income), claim one of the six state mail contracts, or collect a state subsidy, which provides special benefits like a free depot.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, the players pass through time time periods, with different businesses being available in each. The first period focuses on crafts and farms, for example, while the second introduces more industrial businesses such as shoe and textile production. When passing from one period to another, players must choose to make some of their existing businesses obsolete. Since a player can manage only eight businesses, however, you'll likely want to make room for more profitable ventures anyway.<br/><br/>If all mail routes, state subsidies and special routes are claimed by the end of any round, the game ends at that point; otherwise the game ends after round 16, with the richest player winning New England Rails.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "6.59603", "name": "Rails of New England", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Route/Network Building"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "214", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: USA"]}, "67362": {"rpgartist": ["Paul J.

That series will present operational simulations of medium-to-large-sized battles fought during World War II on that front. There will be two players in each game, and solitaire play is easily doable.<br/>  There are two general types of units in the counter-mix: maneuver (non-artillery) and artillery. In addition, certain units are classed as &ldquo;armored.&rdquo; Individual units vary in organizational size from platoons to regiments.<br/>   The action in GT is focused on the Kursk offensive&rsquo;s southern front, as the SS Panzer Corps breaks through the Soviet main line of resistance, held by elements of 6th Guards Army. The German spearheads are then met by a counterattack from 5th Guards Tank Army. What followed was one of the more controversial battles of World War II. There&rsquo;s still historical debate about its significance. Some historians claim German tank losses here made it the turning point of the war in the east. Others say German losses were exaggerated; it was the Red Army that suffered massively, and the Germans actually called off the offensive for strategic reasons. Here is your chance to explore those interpretations.<br/>  Each hex in GT represents one kilometer (0.62 miles) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents a day. There&rsquo;s a nine-turn short scenario and a 13-turn long scenario. The rules weigh in at a little under 14,000 words. Two experienced players can complete the short scenario in about four hours. Rules cover such items as: reinforcements, replacements, command-control, zones of control, adjacent and ranged combat, first and second wave combat, suppression, anti-tank fire, airpower, weather, fog of war, supply, untried units, and special tactics.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["World at War magazine edition"], "name": "Guards Tank: The Battle of Prochorovka, July 1943", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "average": "6.50417", "usersrated": "24", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["East Front Battles Series", "Magazine: World at War"]}, "67369": {"rpgdesigner": ["Paco Pepe Campos", "Gustavo Casta\u00f1er", "Alejo Cuervo", "Eduard Disipio", "Enric Grau", "Francesc Morral", "Juan Par\u00e9s", "Javier Perales", "Sylvie Poissenot", "Eduard Ravell", "Xavier Salvat", "Alex Sierra", "Martin Smith", "Salvador Tintor\u00e9", "Mario Torradas", "Gonzalo Tutusaus", "Francesc Vila"], "statistics": [], "name": "Playrol (Issue 4 - Jan/Feb 1990)", "rpgartist": ["Gonsi & Zalba"], "rpgproducer": ["Enric Grau", "Xavier Salvat", "Alex Sierra"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic672386.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": ["Playrol"], "rpg": ["Basic Dungeons & Dragons", "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)", "Playrol", "Traveller (Classic)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpgissueversion": ["Playrol n\u00famero 4"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic672386_t.jpg", "description": "SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Editorial<br/>Notas de los redactores de la editorial<br/>&iquest;Qui&eacute;n puede matar a un orco?<br/>La llamada de Cthulhu<br/>De los culos gordos y lo g&uuml;evones<br/>Hoy, ents<br/>M&oacute;dulo gen&eacute;rico de ciencia ficci&oacute;n: La nave perdida<br/>Personajes para Traveller<br/>M&oacute;dulo de Cthulhu: G&eacute;nesis negro<br/>Aventura para 2 a 5 personajes, a&ntilde;os 20 y en la ciudad londinense.<br/>Comic central: Orquilandia<br/>La orquita comedia, o los orcos tambi&eacute;n lloran<br/>El Alquimista<br/>Nuevo personaje para D&amp;D B&aacute;sico<br/>C&oacute;mic: En casa del Bom Tontadil y &Ntilde;esmaug el Drag&oacute;n<br/>El Rinc&oacute;n Literario<br/>Entrevista con Michael Moorcock<br/>Noticias: The Daily rol<br/>Sobre las Jesir 89<br/>Francia en Barcelona<br/>Novedades de juegos<br/><br/>"}, "67370": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Cole Wehrle"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "poll": [], "name": "Heaven's Mandate: the Reunification of China", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Partnerships", "Worker Placement"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: China"], "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic674985_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic674985.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Civilization", "Economic", "Political", "Wargame"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The great Han Dynasty, once the paragon of peace and order in the world, has atrophied under the weight of corruption and conspiracy.

No miniatures come with this game!<br/>This way a player may pick any of his miniatures and calculate their point costs referring to the extremely well elaborated and very fine tuned equipment list.<br/>There are rules for about everything that has ever set it's metal or plastic foot on a futuristic war-torn gametable:<br/>Humans, aliens, different kinds of humanoids, tough races, weak races, robots, androids, crafts, cannons, artillery, sabotage, special ammunition, cybernetics - everything you could wish for.<br/>Even the equipment table basically covers everything &quot;out there&quot; - maybe you'll have to substitute sometimes some weapons (like a boltpistol with a common pistol), but you will be able to work with everything that you might find in the hands or at the belt of your miniature.<br/><br/>The rulebook covers the basic rules as well as experts' rules and campaign rules.<br/><br/>Even though Level II is designed for small scale skirmishes with only a couple of individual fighters per side, the rules don't prevent you from playing large scale combats as well. <br/>In that case however players should have only a few different troop types, to keep combat simple.<br/>For example on the one hand you could get about 50 - 100 light weighted fighters for 1000 points, but if you really spice them up, you may field less than 10 tough guys for the same value, too.<br/><br/>Level II uses an unique command system:<br/>The army of a player is divided into several groups (one at least!) consisting of a number of fighters depending on the faction they are fighting for.<br/>Each group gets one command (e.g. &quot;advance&quot;), represented by a chit placed at that group's position. Depending on that command, each fighter of that group may take up to two different actions (mostly moving + something different, like e.g. taking aim).<br/>In order to change that command, certain conditions have to be met (roll versus a certain value with modifiers according to circumstances like e.g. groupleader killed or minimum distance not met) - if the roll fails the command is either changed later or even not at all.<br/>Specialits may act according to their specialities whenever the player sees fit.<br/><br/>Level II plays very realistically: Most weapons kill an unarmoured human with one hit - just as in real life. This way you will have to be very careful with about everything: <br/>How are you going to spend your points?<br/>Where and (even mor important:) how are you going to move your fighters?<br/>This way, Level II is a very tactical skirmish game where the skill and the experience of a player garantee a victory instead of lucky dierolls.<br/><br/>"}, "67412": {"rpgartist": ["Lorelle Ahlstrom", "Jolly R.

The Voltron box offers players an excellent (and complete) way to get into the game but with some characters you're likely already familiar with. The game is also fully compatiable with other Monsterpocalypse miniatures and maps, so you'll no doubt start to see Terra Kahn vs. Voltron and such.<br/><br/>Voltron (and his nemesis Lo-Tron) are morphers, a type of monster whose Alpha form is made up of a series of unit-sized pieces. Voltron is unique in that previous morpher's Alpha forms were made up of 4 units, whereas Voltron and Lo-Tron are both 5 units.

To secure power in the Seven Kingdoms and to ensure the survival of their lines, the Houses of Westeros each follow very different paths. Some forge strategic alliances, some create complex political intrigues, and still others use deceit and betrayal. But there is no more direct or lasting path to power than taking to the field of battle.<br/><br/>In Battles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R. Martin&rsquo;s A Song of Ice and Fire series, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own. In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rock&rsquo;s endless supply of gold.<br/><br/>Battles of Westeros is played over one of several included scenarios, called battles. Each of these has a battle plan that dictates the formation of the map (called the battlefield), starting positions of each House&rsquo;s units, starting resources, special rules, and victory conditions for the game session. A battle is played over several rounds, with each round consisting of alternating player turns. The goals a player needs to accomplish to win a game of Battles of Westeros can vary (some battles require players to earn a certain number of victory points, while other battles require a player to take and hold strategic positions on the battlefield), but this collection of available scenarios, along with the ability to make your own exciting battles with the double-sided map board and over thirty map overlays, gives Battles of Westeros a wealth of replayability!<br/><br/>Battles of Westeros also offers plenty of strategic complexity, resulting in a satisfying number of compelling choices in every game. For example, each player has a special randomized Leadership Deck, consisting of unique tactics and abilities; this deck will change based on the scenario being played and characters present. Is Jaime Lannister on the battlefield? If you draw the appropriate Leadership Card, he can order nearby troops to aggressively rush their opponents! Is Eddard Stark guiding his forces into battle? Special flanking maneuvers enter your Leadership Deck, to potentially be drawn into your hand.<br/><br/>Battles of Westeros also features a level of realism that immerses you in the most significant conflicts of the War of the Five Kings. Each plastic figure base, which holds your infantry, archer, cavalry, and kennelmaster units, has a slot for a banner pole &ndash; a small flag-bearing attachment. The plastic banners that attach to each unit bear the crest of that unit&rsquo;s house, and their orientation on the pole indicates at a glance whether that unit has been ordered yet. In addition to the intuitive and useful game effect this provides (differentiating the units you&rsquo;ve activated from those you haven&rsquo;t), the sight of your army&rsquo;s banners spread impressively across the gorgeously designed game board will give you the sense that you are the clever Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock... or the stoic Robb Stark, with his direwolf Grey Wind at his side!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese First Edition", "English First Edition", "French first edition", "French second edition", "German first edition", "Italian edition", "Polish edition", "Spanish First edition"], "average": "7.38972", "name": "Battles of Westeros", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Battles of Westeros: Brotherhood Without Banners", "Battles of Westeros: House Baratheon Army Expansion", "Battles of Westeros: Lords of the River", "Battles of Westeros: Promo Cards", "Battles of Westeros: Tribes of the Vale", "Battles of Westeros: Wardens of the North", "Battles of Westeros: Wardens of the West"], "usersrated": "2363", "boardgameaccessory": ["Battles of Westeros: Premium Banner Pack"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games", "Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Battles of Westeros", "Commands & Colors", "A Song of Ice and Fire"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["D6G Ep 60: Battles of Westeros Designer Interview &amp; Game Review", "Episode 6 And The Winner Is\u2026"]}, "67493": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic693959.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "5", "age": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Danawares"], "maxplaytime": "20", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic693959_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Puzzle"], "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Cinderella, Ariel, Snow White, Aurora and Belle are racing to get ready and get to the Ball!
