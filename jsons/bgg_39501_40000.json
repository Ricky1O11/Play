Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.  (Description taken from the Scrabble entry).<br/><br/>This Presidential edition of Scrabble is based on the familiar classic but with several interesting twists.  The letters and basic rules remain the same, but there are several important differences.  <br/>    The board is round and not square.  <br/>    All of the extra scoring spaces are replaced with the various states.  They have two effects.  The give the familiar triple letter or triple word scoring bonus.  In addition each states gives an additional bonus equal to the state&rsquo;s Electoral College value (after all other modifications).  So for instance California is a triple letter space and gives a bonus of 55 points as well (it is also way off to one side).<br/>    There is a list of extra &ldquo;words&rdquo; that are worth extra points; either 5, 10 or 15 points.  Some of these &ldquo;words&rdquo; are things like FDR or LBJ which would not ordinarily be available to use, while others are regular words like vote that just give an extra bonus.<br/>    Finally there is a deck of cards showing all of the Presidents.  Each card has a bit of historical information and gives a way to either get an extra bonus when played or change the rules in some fashion.

It is played by the Manga (or: Mba) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They live between Kisangani and Banalia and the game is played along the road that links Kisangani with Buta between kilometer 17 and 118. The Manga are the most southern Sudanese tribe in Upper Zaire. <br/>The board, which measures about a meter, is made from the wood of the Kombo-Kombo (Musanga cecropioides). A beautiful Mbelele board is shown in the National Museum in Kinshasa since 1975. <br/>What makes it a special game is the bizarre board and the fact that although there are two rows on the board, they are not shared by both players, as each plays only on his own row, making it one of the few two cycle games played on two rank boards. According to Townshend the game could also be regarded as a three-row mancala.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board (called mbele p&aacute;pa) consists of two rows of 16 holes and four intermediate holes that are called teka. At the beginning of the game there are three seeds (Sing.: mbelele; Pl.: mbelese) in each hole. On his turn the player takes all the seeds of a hole belonging to his side and sows them in either direction in multiple laps, until he gets to an empty hole. If he reaches the last hole in his side he comes back. <br/>If the last seed is sown in an empty hole opposite to a non-empty enemy hole, the opponent's seeds are captured. <br/>If the move ends in any of the teka, the capture is made in the correspondent hole of the opponent. <br/>A capture made with a singleton captures only a single seed. <br/>It is not allowed to start a move from the last hole but one on the right, going to the right, if it contains only two seeds (he move would end in the same hole). <br/>The winner is the player who captures all of the opponent's seeds. A draw is not possible.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39602": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Moruba", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1209856_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1209856.jpg", "boardgamefamily": ["Mancala"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A mancala game.<br/><br/>Source: <a target='_blank' href='http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Moruba' rel='nofollow'>http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Moruba</a><br/><br/>&quot;Moruba (also Maruba) is a mancala game played by the Pedi (obsolete: Bapedi) in the South African provinces of Limpopo (mostly in the North Sotho speaking parts) and Mpumalunga in former Transvaal. Later, the game has been spread by mine workers to Gauteng. It is closely related to games described in Mozambique, e.g. Tchouba and Njombwa. The game was first researched in 1917 by the British ethnograph P. A. Wagner.<br/><br/>Moruba is traditionally played by men in the late afternoon in the shade of a tree. The game was used during war and was a social activity where men strategised about a variety of activities and events related to them, also shared advise and ideas. Language, expressions and terminology of the game signify what happens when war takes place. As women weren't allowed to go to war, they didn't play the game. In recent days, however, both genders began to play.<br/><br/>Starting in 2003, Moruba is promoted as an indigenous sport by the CSIR's National Product Development Centre and the South African Sports Commission (SASC). There were team and individual tournaments at the Indigenous Games Festival in Polokwane and the Indigenous Games Competition in Tzaneen. The game is also supported by the Mpumalanga Department of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture and the Department of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture of the Province Gauteng, because it forms an important expression of indigenous identity and, as it was said, of a &quot;healthy life style&quot;. The best players, among them D. Shikwambam and Petrus Shibambu, are organized in Mindsports South Africa (MMSA).<br/><br/>This renaissance of African games is a response to Thabo Mbeki's call &quot;to rediscover what was lost by indigenous people (of Africa through colonialism)&quot;.<br/><br/>Today the towns of Sasekani and Bolobedu are centers of the game. Strong clubs are also in Ka-Phalaborwa, Letaba, and Selwane. The newspaper Mopani News reports reguarly on Moruba competitions. The game which is already taught in the Bolobedu High School, will soon be introduced in all schools of Limpopo Province. Dickson Mpofu, the indigenous games co-ordinator in Mpumalanga, even wants to register Moruba with the Olympic committee.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>The size of the game board often depends on the number of players. Most common are boards which have four rows of 12 holes (mekoti) each, but the number of holes can vary from four to 36 holes per row. The holes are dug into the earth. Each hole has two counters, usually pebbles or morula pips, which are called mathlapa (&quot;cattle&quot;) or tinkhomo (&quot;cow&quot;).<br/><br/>The game is played by two persons and sometimes by teams of up to six.<br/><br/>Each player (or team) only uses his side of the board.<br/><br/>On his turn a player takes the contents of one of his holes, which must contain at least two stones, and distributes them, one by one, counterclockwise into consecutive holes on his own side.<br/><br/>If the last stone falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap in the same direction.<br/><br/>The move ends (kulala; literally &quot;to sleep&quot;) when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole.<br/><br/>If the last stone falls into an empty hole of the inner row and the opposite hole of his opponent contains stones, these enemy stones are &quot;killed&quot; (tlaba) or &quot;hit&quot;. Additionally, the stones in the hole of the same file in the outer row are &quot;captured&quot; (tlola). The killed or captured stones are removed from the board. The player is then entitled to capture the contents of any two other enemy holes.<br/><br/>When a player has only singletons, he is permitted to move them, but only in empty holes.<br/><br/>The player who has still stones at the end of the game is declared the winner. It is a draw, when the board position repeats without anything being captured. &quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39603": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Mefuvha", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1255681_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "boardgamefamily": ["Mancala"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1255681.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Hand Made edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A mancala game.

It is closely related to Moruba played in the same area by the Pedi and to games known by the Tonga in Mozambique, e.g. Tchouba and Njombwa. The game is played by men only, while women play Ndode, a game of dexterity.<br/><br/>Mefuvha is mentioned in old Venda legends such as the story of Sankhambi and the Baboons, which was written down by the British ethnologist Hugh Arthur Stayt in 1931.<br/><br/>In the rainy season it is strictly tabu to play the game with stones, for fear that the rain will be turned to hail; fruit pips are used instead. Moreover, it is prohibited to play the game after sunset because this would provoke cattle theft. The symbolic meanings of the game are athmospheric conflict and cattle-raiding.<br/>Mefuvha Board<br/><br/>Mefuvha is played on solid wooden boards made from the trunk of a tree that can measure two meters and longer. Stayt observed boards up to 28 holes per row. The game was thus regarded to be the largest mancala game until it was reported in 1971 that Nsolo is played on bigger boards (up to 4x36 holes). Since 1995, Tchouba is known to be even larger (up to 4x40 holes).<br/><br/>The name of the game has often been misspelled as Mefuhva.<br/> Rules:<br/><br/>Mefuvha is played on a board with an equal even number of square holes in each of the four rows from six to twenty-eight in a row, the usual number being between sixteen and twenty.<br/><br/>The holes contain two seeds except the leftmost hole of each player's inner row, which is empty, and the holes adjacent to them in the inner rows, which have just one seed.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the rules are identical to Moruba.<br/><br/>"}, "39604": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Mwambulula", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Mancala"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A mancala game.

It is the one of the largest mancala games known to exist. A close variant of the game was already described in 1913 by Meredith G. Sanderson, a military doctor in the British colony Nyasaland (today Malawi). The rules which are given in this description were reported in 1975 from Ndola, Zambia. The holes are usually dug in the ground.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The game is played on a board ranging from 4 x 8 to 4 x 36 holes.<br/><br/>Each player owns the two rows on his side.

The largest variant needs 284 stones.<br/><br/>At his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes one for one in a counter-clockwise direction in the consecutive holes of his two rows. If the last stone falls in a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last stone) are picked up and then distributed in the same way.<br/><br/>The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole.<br/><br/>It is only permitted to move singletons for a player if he has no holes left which contain two or more stones. However, singletons may only be moved if the next hole is empty.<br/><br/>If the last stone falls into an empty hole of the players inner row and the opposite hole of the opponents inner row contains stones, these enemy stones are captured.<br/><br/>In addition, this move entitles a player to remove, from any part of his opponent's area, the same number of stones as were captured from the occupied hole.<br/><br/>The captured stones are removed from play.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player resigns or does not have any stones left.

In Bil&eacute;n it is the plural of qeltay, the name of the seeds used in the game. This particular variant is played among the Beni Amir and Mensa people, mainly by elders and young boys in their leisure time, as well as by males generally, especially during the period after marriage ceremonies. The elders often played it for large stakes, such as a hundred cows or a piece of land.<br/><br/>It was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 as Qelat II (Game 11) who stated that &quot;the counting of balls in the course of play is fully permissible.&quot;<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Qelat is played by two players.<br/><br/>The game board consists of two rows of six holes. Initially, there are 4 seeds in each hole.<br/><br/>Qelat is a two-directional game played on a twelve-hole board without pre-designated storehouse holes. As the game proceeds, each player creates up to six storehouse holes, called waldas.<br/><br/>On each turn, players sow only from one of the six holes on their own side of the board, but not from waldas. Seeds from the three holes on a player's right are sown counter-clockwise, whereas seeds from the three holes on a player's left are sown clockwise. Qelat is a single lap mancala game.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture holes, which is done, as in many games, by dropping the last ball in any hand into a hole containing three balls which are thus increased to four. Such captured holes, corresponding to the weg of other areas, are known as walda, but can be captured only in certain parts of the board.<br/><br/>The leftmost and rightmost holes on either player's own side of the board, as well as the outer two holes on the opponent's side of the board are eligible to become waldas for that player.<br/><br/>Thereafter seeds accumulate in walda(s) from the sowing of both players. Waldas are not skipped as incorrectly stated by Mohr.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who accumulates the largest number of balls in his walda(s).<br/><br/>Unlike many other mancala games, a player who is unable to move passes turns until a legal move is available. When neither player can move, the game is over. At the end of the game, the player who has captured the most seeds wins.<br/><br/>Pankhurst didn't say how to avoid repetition of board positions. It is suggested to use the following rule from another mancala game (Mazagebh I (Game 12)) of the same region: When a player moves a ball across the end of the board to his opponent's opposite hole the latter player is forbidden to shift the ball back in the following move.&quot;<br/><br/>Pankhurst, R. 1971.

Most players are herdsman taking their cattle to water, newly married couples and their friends, and housewives in their homes.<br/><br/>Qelat is usually played in holes in the ground, but wooden boards are also known. The following game was observed by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 who called it Qelat II (Game 5). It might be related to Um el Banat (&quot;game of women&quot;), a mancala game to be found in northern Sudan.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Qelat is played on a two-row board with six playing holes per row called b&eacute;t in Bil&eacute;n (literally &quot;house&quot;) and two larger holes at the end of the board to store captured balls. Initially there are four balls in each b&eacute;t. The balls are called til in Bil&eacute;n, if they are dry goat droppings or shesher, if they are small stones.<br/><br/>The balls are always sown one by one in an anti-clockwise direction.<br/><br/>If the last ball falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last dropped ball are picked up and continued to be distributed into the following holes.<br/><br/>The move ends when the last seed falls into an empty hole.<br/><br/>The players try to capture enemy holes by increasing their contents to four with the last sown ball in any hand. Captured holes are known as ekwarna, literally &quot;a child is born to me&quot;.<br/><br/>A move may not start from an ekwarna with the result that balls would tend to accumulate in such holes. A player dropping the last ball in any hand into one of his own ekwarna might say lagadi yekura, literally &quot;grow up my children!&quot;.<br/><br/>When the last ball falls into an ekwarna captured by his opponent he would &quot;eat&quot; (qunna in Bil&eacute;n) one of the counters in that hole, and put it, together with the ball effecting this capture, aside as his takings.<br/><br/>A player's ownership of an ekwarna continues even if it becomes empty. Thus balls subsequently entering such a hole, belong to the player who had captured it, while his opponent on dropping the last counter of any lap there would put this counter aside as his takings.<br/><br/>It is not permitted to pass as long as a player has a legal move.<br/><br/>The round comes to an end when all the balls are captured either by being put aside or accumulated in ekwarna. The players then count out their total earnings by placing them back in their holes, four counters per hole. Pankhurst reported:<br/><br/><br/>        A player who had captured more than his original number of counters would gain one hole from his enemy for every four balls he captured. Should a player have won three extra counters his opponent, who had an extra counter, was obliged to cede to the player with tree who thus acquired an additional hole. If, on the other hand, the two players were each left at the end oft the round with two extra balls they would draw lots to decide to whom they should belong and who in consequence should gain the hole at issue. <br/><br/><br/>Eventually, the player who gains a monopoly of all the balls and hence of all twelve holes is declared winner.<br/><br/>"}, "39609": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Rio kadalis", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Mancala"], "average": "2", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A mancala game.

When you have sown all the pieces on your hand, you take the ones in the next circle and keep on sowing with them. <br/>The turn ends when the last stone is dropped in a circle which is followed by an empty one. <br/>If the empty circle is followed by an occupied one, its contents are captured. <br/>According to the original description it is not permitted to choose the hole from which the move begins. You must take the first non-empty hole after the hole where the opponent finished her last move. This would lead to a single game that would be played exactly the same all the time. V&iacute;ktor Bautista i Roca therefore suggested: <br/>     You can choose from which hole the sowing is started. <br/>     The game ends when both players agree that it is impossible to capture more pieces and the remaining stones are not counted. <br/>According to Murray's misinterpretation of Das Gupta's description &quot;the player captures the contents of the hole beyond, or if there is a sequence of empty holes, the contents of the first loaded hole&quot;. Das Gupta says, clearly, &quot;he will be in possession of the pieces lying within the circle immediately next to the latter&quot;. <br/>The player who captures more pieces wins the game.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39614": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Sz'Kwa", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Recognition", "Point to Point Movement"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2422574_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2422574.jpg", "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Ancient"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A Chinese game related to Xi Gua Qi but different, although using a similar board.<br/><br/>From Wikipedia:<br/><br/>Sz'Kwa<br/>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>Jump to: navigation, search<br/>Sz'Kwa is a two-player abstract strategy game from Taiwan.

Apparently, the word derived from Geez selus which means &quot;three&quot;. [NB: This makes sense since Ge'ez is an Afro-Asiatic language and this is then cognate with Hebrew shelosh.]<br/> In 1972, Richard Pankhurst wrote an excellent 53-page article on Ethiopian mancala games, including games from Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia. He gave the rules of 103 games, of which 12 were three-row games or &quot;Selus&quot;.<br/><br/>In the 1970s, Selus was still played in the highlands of Eritrea and in certain regions of modern Ethiopia, notably northern Tigre, Dorz&eacute; and Kulu Konta.<br/><br/>This particular variant was reported from the city of Massawa, Eritrea. It was described as Game 13 by Pankhurst.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board has 3x6 holes. Initially there are three seeds in each hole. Each player owns the row closest to him and the three holes of the central row at his right hand.<br/><br/>Each move starts with a player emptying the contents of one of his holes that is not a wegue (&quot;wound&quot;). Then, the seeds are dropped one by one into the following holes.<br/><br/>If the last seed falls into an occupied hole other than a wegue, the player takes up its contents and distributes these seeds in a new lap. Let's suppose you start the move in your left corner: the seeds are first distributed in your own back row from left to right, then in your central holes from right to left, afterwards in your opponent's back row from right to left and finally in your opponent's central row from right to left (see the diagram).<br/><br/>It is not permitted to pass a move unless a player has no legal move left.<br/><br/>The move ends if the last seed is dropped into an empty hole. This is called kwah, an onomatopoetic word that imitates the sound of the stone alighting on the board.<br/><br/>Wegues are created when the last seed distributed falls into a hole of three, thus making four seeds. The creator is called the owner of the wound who marks it in a distinctive way. Creating a wegue ends the move. A wegue can be created on either side of the board.<br/><br/>If the last seed of a move is dropped into a wegue, the player captures this seed and, unless the wound was empty, one of the seeds it contained. Capturing is permitted from any wegue, irrespective of the owner. The player must move again (beginning with any hole of his side which is not a wegue) if he captured from a wegue he owns, but must stop moving, if he captured from a wegue owned by his opponent.<br/><br/>Exception:<br/><br/><br/>     The two left-hand holes in a player's back row are called ayemi (&quot;eye&quot;). A player is not permitted to capture from an eye on his side, only from the opponent's side. In that case, he must move again, even if he has captured from an opponent's wegue. If the last seed fell into a wegue in your own ayemi, the move ends. <br/><br/><br/>The creation of a wound is only permitted after the original set-up has been destroyed, i.e. after the first move of a game. If, in the first move, the last seed makes four seeds, they are distributed in another lap.<br/><br/>The game ends when both players have no move left. Each player scores a point for each captured seed and a point for each seed in a wegue owned by him. The player with most points wins.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39616": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Tchadji", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Mancala"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A manqala game.

It has been studied by Abdulcarimo Ismael, a mathematician from Universidade Pedag&oacute;gica, Maputo. It is played mostly by men. <br/>Except for the initial position, and for the fixed length of the board, tchadji is identical to mefuvha and moruba.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Tchadji is played in a wooden board with four rows of eight holes each. At the beginning there are 2 seeds (Caesalpinia bonduc) per hole. Each player only uses his side of the board, which consists of two rows. <br/>At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his holes, which must contain at least two seeds, and distributes them, one by one, counterclockwise into consecutive holes on his own side. <br/>If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap in the same direction, and so on. <br/>The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole. <br/>If the last seed is put into an empty hole of the inner row and the opposite hole of the opponent contains seeds, these enemy seeds are &quot;eaten&quot; (odj&aacute;). <br/>Additionally, the seeds of the outer hole directly behind it, if any, are also eaten and the contents of another (any) enemy hole. The eaten seeds of the opponent are removed from the board. <br/>When a player has only singletons (ompwech&aacute;, &quot;divided into pieces&quot;), he is permitted to move them, but only into empty holes. <br/>The winner is the one who captures all the opponent's seeds. <br/>Other data<br/>Talking about habitual players, the first move is made without counting, as they know beforehand what are the best moves. Usually the first move is made from the last but one hole in the outter row (the second from the right). On next moves players do count. <br/>According to the study made by Ismael, a game lasts a mean of 146 seconds, and 38 moves per player. The shortest (in time) recorded game lasted 62 seconds. The shortest in moves, 16. The longest, 4 minutes 39 seconds and 73 moves respectively.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39617": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "To\u011f\u0131zqumalaq", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "15", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic683353_t.jpg", "average": "8.12333", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic683353.jpg", "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial", "Mancala"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A game of the mancala family.<br/><br/>\u0422\u043e\u0493\u044b\u0437\u049b\u04b1\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0430\u049b (to\u011f\u0131zqumalaq, sometimes spelled toghyzqumalaq or togyzqumalaq or toguz kumalak, &quot;nine balls&quot;) is the Kazakh name of a mancala game also known as toguz korgool in Kyrgyz.<br/> It is played traditionally in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, parts of Russia (Altay, Khakassia, Tuva), Western Mongolia and in China in regions close to the aforementioned countries. <br/>There are regular to\u011f\u0131zqumalaq championships held in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia.

It was won by Aidos Seitzhanov from Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>To\u011f\u0131zqumalaq is played board made of two rows of nine holes, plus two kazans (&quot;boilers&quot;), either in the middle of the board or one at each end of it. The players own the kazan at their right, if at the ends, or the one on the other half of their board, if in the middle. <br/>As captures are made by pairs, the holes are usually made in a way so it is evident whether the contents are odd or even. <br/>To begin the game, there must be nine balls per hole, except the kazans, which are empty. That is, 162 balls are needed.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player takes all the balls of a hole on his side of the board, and distribute them anticlockwise, one per hole, on the following holes, starting from the very same hole he has taken them.

It was described by Namzhildorzh in 1963 for the first time. Although a very small board is used, the game is challenging for humans (not so much for computers) because it usually takes more than 150 moves.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The game is played on a board (kh&ouml;l&ouml;g) of 2 x 3 = 6 holes. Initially each hole contains six dungballs (khorgol), excrements of camels, goats and sheep are recommended.<br/><br/>At his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes, one by one, in a clockwise direction (viewed as the male direction in Mongolia). The first ball must be dropped into the succeeding hole.<br/><br/>If the last ball is dropped into one of your own holes which then contains four balls, you capture the contents (four balls).<br/><br/>The game ends when a player cannot move or the board position repeats.<br/><br/>If a player cannot move, the remaining balls are captured by the player who was able to move last. The player with most balls wins.<br/><br/>The traditional rule for what happens when the board position repeats is unknown. In other mancala games, counters that continue to circulate around the board are either divided between the players (Oware) or they are not counted (Cross-Wari). It is also possible that the game is considered to end without result (Aw-li On-nam Ot-tjin).&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "39620": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Vai lung thlan", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1570863_t.png", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1570863.png", "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial", "Mancala"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A mancala game.

Shakespear. This mancala game is played by both sexes of the Mizo (the modern name for the Lushai people) who live in the Indian State of Mizoram located between Myanmar and Bangladesh.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board consists of two rows of six holes.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player lifts up all the stones of one of his holes and distributes them clockwise, one by one, into the consecutive holes, first along his row and then back along that of his opponent.<br/><br/>If the last stone is dropped into an empty hole on either side of the board, the player captures it as well as all stones which precede this hole (that is, against the direction of movement or anti-clockwise) by an unbroken chain of single stones. Captured stones are removed and placed aside by the player.<br/><br/>No matter whether it was captured or not, the move is over after one lap.<br/><br/>The players move alternately and passing is prohibited, unless a player has no legal move.<br/><br/>The game is finished when no stones are left on the board. The player who has captured more stones wins. If each player has captured 30 stones, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>Suggestions for good play:<br/><br/>The game starts slow, but accelerates as stones are captured or accumulated in a few holes and the board is cleared. The middle game should be a clever exchange of stones.<br/><br/>A hole containing 12 stones can always capture at least one stone because the last stone is dropped into the emptied hole. On the other hand, it is impossible for holes which contain more than 12 stones to capture. These holes can be used for defence because by distributing their contents all empty holes of the board are filled. At the end of the game players try to deprive their opponent of legal moves while keeping as many stones as possible on their own side in such a way that only single stones are created when they are distributed. Therefore, overloaded holes become &quot;bad shape&quot;.<br/><br/>Quote:<br/><br/>Counting the stones in the hole before removing them is not allowed, and considerable skill is required to judge accurately the number of stones, so as to select a hole containing the number of stones which when distributed will leave the maximum number of holes with single stones in them. <br/>J.

It contains 10 scenario cards.<br/><br/>Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck Publishing web site:<br/><br/>31 August 1944... The Royal 22nd Regiment moved into action before dawn in a bid to secure the right shoulder of the breach in the Gothic Line. Engineers worked through the night to clear three narrow paths in the minefield where the West Novas had earlier come to grief, Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Allard hurried two companies forward.<br/><br/>1 September 1944... In the centre, the Fifth Division had not been idle. Monte Peloso and Tomba di Pesaro were its primary objectives, but it took most of the day to complete their capture. The original plan called for the Perths and Strathconas to attack Peloso, but this had to be revised when it became apparent that fresh infantry would be needed.<br/><br/><br/>15 September 1944... Eighth Army designated the Canadian Corps as its pursuit corps and placed the British 4th and 2nd New Zealand divisions, the British 25th Army Tank Brigade, and the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade. The Canadian Corps was to launch its assault as soon as the rains stopped.<br/><br/><br/>18 September 1944... The situation on the First Canadian Division&rsquo;s front was not so happy. Unlike the British V Corps, the Canadian First Division commander Chris Vokes was unable to offer assurances about getting over the Ausa on the 18th and nothing could be done until San Martino had been recaptured and the first had moved up to the Rimini railway line. Finesse had not worked thus far, thus the Vokes decided to try brute force.<br/><br/><br/>23 September 1944... Intent on debouching into the broad valley of the Po, the First Canadian Corps poured troops and tanks through the Marecchia bridgehead. General Burns had designated three successive rivers as the main objectives of the coming operations, the Fiumicino, the Savio, and the Ronco, twenty-five miles beyond the Marecchia.  <br/>5 December 1944... The First Division was having problems. Despite committing it&rsquo;s reserve unit, the Carleton and York Regiment, the Third Brigade was unable to get beyond the Lamone. By the morning of 4 December, 48-hours after launching its first attacks, the brigade had finally closed up to the river, to find that the Germans had retired behind the blown railway and road bridges.<br/><br/><br/>13 December 1944... The battle for the Naviglio began after dark on Tuesday, 12 December. Four battalions spearheaded the operation. On the right, the Fifth Division sent into action the only two infantry units that had not yet been involved in the fighting, the Princess Louise Dragoons Guards (Plugs) and the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish, while the First Division committed the Carleton and York and, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment. It was overcast evening, with a thick mist giving way to drizzle as the troops slogged forward<br/><br/><br/>15 December 1944... While the Fifth Division pushed across the Naviglio and closed up to the Fosso Munio, the First Division staged a series of local attacks to widen its bridgehead for break-out. During the night of 14-15 December, Princess Patricia&rsquo;s Canadian Light Infantry moved over the canal, with the task of driving the Germans out of ancient, walled Bagnacavallo, where many of the enemy counter-attacks had originated.<br/><br/><br/>20 December 1944... There was no let-up. A determined Charles Foulkes met with his Division commanders within hours after the First Brigades failure on the Fosso Vecchio. New plans were drawn up for yet another joint assault between the First and Fifth Divisions that very night. The object was to force the Germans to abandon the S-shaped Fosso Munio and retire behind the Senio and the task was given to two infantry brigades, the Second and Eleventh, both using two-assault battalions.<br/><br/><br/>2 January 1945... The quiet along the Senio was about to be shattered. At either end of the Canadian sector were pockets of German troops and I Corps headquarters had decided to get rid of them before settling down for the winter. On the right, north of Ravenna, the Germans were huddled behind a web of canals and rivers, below the Lago Comacchio along the line extending from the coast to Alfonsine, where it linked up with the Senio defences.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "The Canadians in Italy:  D-Day Dodgers, August 1944 to February 1945", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Modular Board"], "average": "6.6", "boardgameexpansion": ["Advanced Squad Leader"], "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader"]}, "39646": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic404762.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["George Kelln"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2006", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": ["Lone Canuck Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic404762_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "This is a scenario pack for the Advanced Squad Leader system.  Here is the description from the Lone Canuck Publishing web site:<br/><br/>This six-scenario pack revolves around a single, day-long action, in the heart of bocage country between the American 30th Infantry Division, and the German SS-Panzer Division 2 &quot;Das Reich&quot;. Many of the scenarios are ideal for tournament play. <br/> Scenario #1- The US 2d Battalion 120th Infantry Regiment had rejoined its regiment, ready to head the day&rsquo;s attacks. Despite the threat of German counter-attack, the 2d Battalion slowly advanced towards the village of Quesnel. As the Americans entered the village, they came under machine-gun fire from several unseen locations. Unable to call for artillery or armour support and under increasing fire from the village, the American company commander was about to withdraw... <br/> Scenario #2- A small probing force from SS-Panzer Division 2 &ldquo;Das Reich&rdquo; struck the US 30th Division&rsquo;s right flank near the village of l&eacute; Desert. The 743d Tank Battalion, which was on the right of the 30th Division, was enticed by a pair of Panzer IVs to advanced down a minor farm road towards a fork. When the 743d's lead tanks were within 200 yards of the fork, the German armour struck...<br/> Scenario #3- The US 30th Division HQ began to receive reports from the 117th Regiment that German infantry, supported by self-propelled assault guns, was attacking the right flank of its 3d Battalion. At the same moment, the 120th reported that Company B, 743d Tank Battalion had just had a brush with German tanks. The engineers of SS-Panzer-Grenadier Regiment 3, &ldquo;Das Reich&rdquo; supported by the panzers of SS-Panzer Regiment 2, &ldquo;Das Reich&rdquo; had managed to infiltrated through the bocage undetected... <br/>Scenario #4- The Americans continued their southern advance towards the high ground of Hill 32. The 117th Infantry Regiment reported only light resistance from stragglers, but nothing they could not handle. Then late in the afternoon, the Germans launched a counterattack with elements of SS-Engineer Battalion &ldquo;Das Reich&rdquo; supported by assault guns...<br/><br/>Scenario #5- The US 120th Infantry Regiment's  first objective was Hill 32,  and the initial advance progressed relatively calmly, with the leading platoons meeting little, or no resistance. Then as the 120th approached the forward slope of Hill 32, the German resistance stiffened considerably... <br/> Scenario #6- This scenario joins scenarios 1,3, 4, and 5 together as combined game. By 1000-hrs, the US 2d Battalion, 120th Infantry Regiment began its advance with Company B of the 743d Tank Battalion moving ahead of the infantry. Hill 32 was their first objective in the 120th&rsquo;s zone, and the German resistance began to stiffened considerably with heavy artillery strikes, slowing  the 2d Battalion's advance as it approached the high ground...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7", "name": "Battle of the Hedgerows: The Storm Broke", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Modular Board"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Advanced Squad Leader"], "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader"]}, "39647": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Adji-boto", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Mancala"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgameversion": ["Public Domain edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A mancala game. From Mancala.Wikia.com:<br/><br/>Adji-boto (&quot;pebble boat&quot;) is a mancala game which is played by the Saramaccans who live on the upper Saramacca river in Suriname. The Saramaccans are a tribe of Bush-Negroes which was formed by escaped slaves. The first field study on the game was conducted by the American ethnologue Melville J. Herskovits (1895-1963) in 1928 in the village of Beidotti. The game resembles mancala games known in Benin, West Africa.<br/><br/>The game is used to entertain the dead during the ten-day period preceding burial in the kre wosu, or house of mourning. The play is only carried out during the daylight hours because in the night the yorkas, or ghosts of the dead, would come and play with us and eventually carry away our spirits.<br/><br/>The boards are only carved by old widowed men because this is a serious issue. They are made in two shapes, those having straight tops, and those in which the tops are curved. A village should have both types, so that if a person was fond of one kind of board dies, the people can play for a time on the other and there will be a lessened danger of his ghost coming to play with them. Although the Bush-Negroes are fine wood-carvers the Saramacca boards are of the roughest. This is because of the sacred character of the game which is not one which can be hurried in playing. It must entail some effort and even pain  to bring it to perfection.<br/><br/>Rules<br/>Adji-boto is played on a board called adji-bangi (&quot;pebble stool&quot;) that consists of 2x5=10 holes. In addition, each player has a store called boto (&quot;boat&quot;) at his right hand.<br/><br/>Each hole contains 10 stones called adji (&quot;pebbles&quot;) at the start of the game.<br/><br/>Each turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes, except one stone that remains in the hole, one by one, in consecutive holes in an anti-clockwise direction.<br/><br/>In the first ten moves of the game all of the ten playing holes must be played.<br/><br/>It is only permitted to play a hole which contains at least two stones.<br/><br/>It is not allowed to pass a move unless a player has no legal move left.<br/><br/>If the last stone ends (kaba) in a hole which precedes another hole or a continuous chain of holes that contains one, three or five stones (including any sequential combinations), these stones are captured and put into the player's boto. It is possible to capture on either side of the board. The only exception is the opening move in which  nothing is captured. If a Bush-Negro captures he says: &quot;I eat your children!&quot; (Mi nyam yu p'kin kaba!)<br/><br/>The game is finished when both players can't move.<br/><br/>The remaining stones are captured by the player on whose side they are.<br/><br/>The player who has won most stones is declared winner. It is said that  &quot;the loser is killed!&quot; (a kiri mi kaba!).<br/><br/>If both players captured the same number of stones the game is a draw.<br/><br/>"}, "39648": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Sisti Challenge: Circular Checkers", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1963", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic403737_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Circular Checkers, Inc."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic403737.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "Published in 1963 by &quot;Circular Checkers, Inc.&quot; in Newfoundland, New Jersey, &quot;The Sisti Challenge&quot; is a Checkers variant.

These tank battles were the largest of the war and occurred as both sides sought to position themselves before the ceasefire at noon. They began at 10 a.m. as the Israeli Merkava tanks moved deep into the Bekaa Valley from their 77th battalion and the 409th Anti-tank (TOWs on Jeeps) swept far to the north until both collided with the fresh Syrian T-72 tanks of the 82nd Brigade, 3rd Armor Division.<br/>As soon as elements of the Merkava tank battalion arrived, Syrian T-72 tanks began to fire from a distance of 2500-3000 yds. The Israelis inched ever closer to the Syrian border and in desperation, Syrian Milan AT units and Gazelle TOW gunships began to appear. To the Israeli, the going was a cautious advance yet one that had to achieve the most territory before the agreed ceasefire at Noon. The battle is unique for it was the first time the new Russian T-72 tank faced off with the new Israeli Merkava, for both their debut in battle.<br/><br/>Units represent single AFVs, helicopters or infantry AT teams.

Finally, a couple months ago, we came up with the idea of designing a game based on the Norse gods, their foes the Jotun, and the mythical battle to end all battles, Ragnarok. In this game, we&rsquo;ve given the action-reaction system a twist in that the turn sequence is interactive, so as each attack is played, the next card played is actually a counter-attack that can inflict damage. This makes for a very intense battle system where every card can both attack and defend.<br/><br/>In this fact-paced card game, you take on the role of one of Norse mythologies greater gods such as Thor, Odin, Heimdall, or one of their Jotun enemies like Thrym, Fenrir, or Loki.<br/><br/>Once you are girded for battle, you will hack, slash, thrust, and grapple your way to victory!<br/><br/>Ragnarok is designed and packaged to be an economical social game.

Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland reinforced by artillery and engineers crossed the Belgian frontier about midday encountering little resistance. The report of a force which had taken up positions in Etalle comprised of elements of a French Cavalry and motorized reconnaissance units. The Infanterie Regiment Grossdeutschland was dispatched to handle the situation. Upon arriving in village of Etalle, Grossdeutschland found the fighting was serious. Houses had been shot up, telephone wires hung down everywhere, on the corner sat a bullet-ridden civilian automobile. The bridge at the entrance to the village was barricaded and held by the French under heavy rifle, and machine-gun fire coming from the houses behind it. Major F&ouml;st assessing the situation personally took command of the 5th Company and moved to launch an attack.<br/><br/><br/>10 May 1940... While the bulk of the Grossdeutschland Regiment drove towards the Luxembourg frontier. Elements of the 3rd Battalion under Oberstleutnant Barski took off from airfields near the German-Belgium border in 100 three-seat Fieseler Storch. This force was earmarked for the air landing operation codenamed &quot;NIWI&quot;. The 400-men of the Garski Battalion were to be flown 15 km behind the enemy&rsquo;s front lines, with mission to cut communications, hinder reserves reinforcing the front lines and attack the enemy&rsquo;s fortifications from the vulnerable rear. Oberstleutnant Garski&rsquo;s landed at 0600 hours and was only able to link up with nine men of his force. Radio contact was established with XIX Panzer Korps and Garski learned from reports that to the east of Wity, Belgian Ardennes Mountain troops were putting up stiff resistance. Using the earlier commandeered automobiles, Garski quickly moved his force to the western outskirts of Fauvilliers.<br/><br/>11 May 1940... Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland spent the night on the hills northwest of Villiers-sur-Semois screened by a thin line of pickets. The 1st Battalion carrying their machine-guns, ammunition canisters and mortar bases which weighed heavy on men, passed west of Mellier and pushed on towards the village of Suxy. The attack on Suxy developed into a perfect training school attack supported by the Regiments&rsquo; heavy weapons, including artillery and assault guns. The infantry supported by the assault guns stormed into the village and the enemy forces, a French Cavalry reconnaissance company, suffered heavy losses while putting up a stubborn defence.<br/><br/><br/>19 June 1940... The headlong advance south towards France&rsquo;s second largest city Lyon by Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland continued with an assault gun from Lt. Von Werlhoff&rsquo;s platoon leading the way. The first serious French resistance was met near Neuville-sur-Seine. There was a barricade in front of the village, which had a heavy machine gun, two light machine guns and a 47mm anti-tank gun. The assault spearheaded by the 6th Company, Infantry Regiment GD approached the barricade, machine gun and rifle fire suddenly erupted from every house and near-by park. The assault gun immediately went into position and blasted the barricade.<br/><br/>5 July 1941... By midday of 4 July, Grossdeutschland reached Stolpce and Swerzen, about 3 km to the south was the regiments objective, Tschweren. Urgent orders were received to move a strong kampfgruppe into the area northeast of Stolpce where the 15th Infantry Regiment was involved in heavy fighting with an attacking Russian force. By evening, the 1st Battalion GD reached an area near Odceda northwest of Stolpce and set up a hasty defensive position. As the morning fog lifted, a firefight broke out as masses of Russians stormed out of the woods towards the 1st Battalion&rsquo;s positions occupied during the previous night. These first waves were beaten back, however heavy fire continued from the impenetrable wooded area and companies of the 1st Battalion were order to clear out these pockets. The Grenadiers of the 3rd Company rose and moved widely spaced towards the woods.<br/><br/><br/>5 July 1941... Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland received orders to ferret out Russians that were forming up just inside the woods for a break out. 12 km southwest the 6th Company, together with a platoon from the 18th (Pioneer) Company, heavy guns of the 15th Company and elements of the 1st Platoon, 20th(Flak) Company, were ordered to move immediately to Kamienka and launch an attack on the village. The attack against Kamienka and the near by wooded areas began at 0545 and was supported by the heavy infantry guns of the 15th Company. Rapid defensive fire met the attacking German companies, which nevertheless pushed forward with great &eacute;lan, effectively supported by the heavy weapons.<br/><br/><br/>14 December 1941... The German spearheads had got to within a few miles of the outskirts of the Soviet capital. The Soviet realized that their hour had arrived. The projecting wedge of Guderian&rsquo;s Second Panzer Army presented the Soviet&rsquo;s southern group with an opportunity for envelopment from three sides. As dawn broke, Soviet artillery began firing into the village, as the rumbling of tank engines and near by shells burst heralded the Soviet&rsquo;s arrival. A few metres farther stood the anti-tank guns of the 14th (Panzerj&auml;ger) Company, which was fighting with the 1st Battalion. The Panzerj&auml;gers watched as the tanks rolled through the snow, firing as they came. As machine gun fire rattled against the protective armoured shield of their 5cm Pak 38, the Panzerj&auml;gers began their firefight. As the smoke cleared, three enemy tanks were set a fire and Soviet infantry littered the snowy fields around the village. Together with the surviving 35 grenadiers of the 1st Company they had stopped the Soviet breakthrough.<br/><br/>20 February 1942... The heavy Soviet attacks against the weakened German lines continued, but they were unable to make any significant territorial gains. Once more, the Grossdeutschland was tasked to attack. The Regimental commander was forced to merge the two rifle battalions into a single Rifle Battalion Grossdeutschland; as it arrived at its assembly area in preparation for a counterattack. The attack on Kosowka and Tschuchlowo had all the preparations made to ensure the success of this difficult attack. Upon reaching the gully, the Grenadiers began suffering heavy losses as they were opened up upon by heavy machine gun and mortar fire from the smoking buildings in the village. The men of Grossdeutschland waited for darkness to withdraw. The pitiful group that returned numbered 3 officers and 30 men. It was all that remained of the once proud Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.6", "name": "Grossdeutschland Pack 1", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Modular Board"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Advanced Squad Leader"], "usersrated": "10", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader"]}, "39691": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic405162.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["George Kelln"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1998", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Lone Canuck Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic405162_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "This was the first ASL scenario pack published by Lone Canuck.

Bark West was divided into two sandy beaches, &quot;Roger&quot; on the right and &quot;Sugar&quot; on the left. The Hasting and Prince Edward Regiment and the Royal Canadian Regiment of the First Brigade were assigned to Roger Beach, while Sugar was given to the Second Brigade's Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and Seaforth Highlanders. Three miles inland lay the main Canadian objective, the Pachino airfield, near the town of the same name.<br/><br/><br/>Daliki, Russia, 26 June 1943: Partisan attacks on moving trains and extensive demolition of tracks, bridges, and tunnels at times almost halted traffic on the railway routes Warsaw-Gomel-Bryansk and Minsk-Borisov-Smolensk. German anti-partisan operations had developed a definite pattern. As soon as the location of a partisan force became known it would be attacked simultaneously from several sides. Dawn was the preferred time for such raids. However these tactics were successful only if the partisans did not learn beforehand of the Germans' intentions.<br/><br/><br/>South of Casa Barardi, Italy 13 December 1943: In an attempt to gain a port to speed the Commonwealth Forces assault on Rome, the First Canadian Division was assigned to capture the ancient Adriatic port city of Ortona. To gain the approaches to the city the Royal 22nd Regiment was assigned to capture the hamlet of Casa Barardi and the crossroads on the Ortona-Orsogna road beyond. To carry out this task the Royal 22nd&rsquo;s C-Company under the command of Captain Paul Triquet and C Squadron of the Ontario Regiment with seven Shermans under command of Major H.A. &quot;Snuffy&quot; Smith.<br/><br/><br/>Schweigen, Germany, 9 September 1939: On 7 September French units advanced out of the Sarre Gap between the Region Fortifee of Metz and La Lauter of the Maginot Line, moving towards the German industrial centre at Saarbr&uuml;cken. The French units lumbered forward into one of the most heavily defended sectors of the still incomplete Siegfried Line.<br/><br/><br/>Near Eisholz Germany: 1 May 1945: On the 21April the spearheads of the 1st Ukraine Front and the 1st White Russian Fronts met near K&uuml;nigswusterhausen, encircling the three Army Corps of General de Infanterie Busses&rsquo;s German Ninth Army in the Frankfurt-F&uuml;rstenwalde-K&ouml;nigswunsterhausen area. The Ninth Army was now being attacked on three sides. On the morning of 23 April, Hitler had given authorization to pull back the Oder Front. The surrounded Ninth Army formed up for the breakout.<br/><br/><br/>Casa Berardi, Italy 13 December 1943: The Canadian 3rd Brigade committed their reserves, the Royal 22nd Regiment to a hard blow across the &quot;Gully&quot; immediately south of Casa Berardi. In an attempt to pinch out the position in front of the crossroads by driving up from the south. At 0730 hrs, the Vandoos started out for Casa Berardi under heavy shellfire crossing the &quot;Gully&quot;, at a point deemed to be its least formidable point. &quot;C&quot; Company under Captain Paul Triquet which fought its way over the &quot;Gully&quot; doing terrible damage to enemy tanks with the company&rsquo;s PIATs, was to perform a left flanking movement which was would enable the remainder of the Battalion to attack Casa Berardi from in front.<br/><br/><br/>Southern Edge of Scheidiswald, Russia 17 January 1943: Without pause, the second and third phase of this second battle of Lake Ladoga began. The two old corner-posts of the German defence continued to play their former part. The strongpoint of Gorodok with its hospital and power station on the Neva, at the other end, the fortified positions known as the &quot;Wrengler Barrier&quot;. Time and again throughout the Soviet tank attacks, the guns of the 1st Battalion, 240th Artillery Regiment relieved the grenadiers and engineers by timely defensive fire or concentrated bombardment of the focal points of the attack. Late in the afternoon of the 17th the First Troop guns went silent.<br/><br/><br/>Pontaubault, France 1 August 1944: Patton drove his VII Corps down and through the narrow corridor between the German flanking position and the Atlantic Coast. The 4th U.S. Armoured Division reached Avranches in the evening of 30 July. On the following day it took Pontaubault and established a bridgehead over the Selune River. Patton had burst open the door for the breakout into unconfined expanses of France. That is if he could keep the door open. Patton's VII Corps depended on one road over one bridge, for only one single road with one single bridge led from Avranches over the Selune into Brittany.<br/>  <br/>Near Toungoo, Burma 18 March 1942: Late in the afternoon, three British officers were riding along a jungle track towards Toungoo, 250 km from Rangoon, with 100 soldiers of the Burmese Frontier Forces (F.F.2). They had been on the move for weeks, making their way from the distant Chinese frontier. The riders and their small but sturdy Burmese horses were at the limit of their endurance. The 2nd Frontier Forces column was attached to the Chinese formation under General Stilwell, and given reconnaissance duties.<br/><br/><br/>Ozereyka Bay, Russia, 4 February 1943: A Russian Seaborne Invasion landed and moving inland.

You must own several modules of Advanced Squad Leader to utilize these 12 scenarios.<br/><br/>Here is a description of these scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:<br/><br/>4 September 1943... The Canadians splashed ashore at 0430 hours 3rd September, the fourth anniversary of Britain's declaration of war. The Canadians had landed in continental Europe- Hitler's celebrated Festung Europa, without being shot at or suffering a single causality. It was ideal countryside for delaying tactics, executed with excellence by German demolition teams. Steady, if slow progress was made by the Canadian division. The first clash was in Gambarie, a ski resort in a pine forest, was defended not by Germans, but Italians- Fascist militia known as &quot;Black Shirts&quot;...<br/> 7 September 1943... The Second Brigade now moved into the lead, striving to reach Cittanova, a large town on Route 111, one of the lateral highways which crosses the Aspromonte from coast to coast. When the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry were slowed by demolitions along Route 112, Brigadier Chris Vokes sent the Loyal Edmonton Regiment cross-country along a doubtful track which might lead to Cittanova. The Eddies also ran into Italians troops, a hundred German-trained paratroopers of the elite 184th (Nembo) Division, who surprised the Canadians by putting up a spirited fight...<br/><br/><br/>1 October 1943... Campobasso a picturesque city nestled in the eastern foothills of the Apennines was the Canadian objective. Twelve miles from Lucera, Route 17 climbed rapidly. The Princess Louise's Dragoon Guards armoured cars came under heavy machine-gun and shellfire shortly after 0800 hours and the Canadians deployed for a tank-infantry assault. The tank broke into Motta but the infantry were soon pinned down by German artillery and machine-guns...<br/><br/><br/>6 December 1943... The First Canadian Division commander, Chris Vokes after studying patrol reports decided to establish a bridgehead and chose to cross the Moro at three points. The bridgeheads; on Route 16 near the mouth of the Moro, at San Leonardo and at Villa Rogattia village two miles upstream from San Leonardo. The Hasty Ps were to cross the Moro on the right, while the Seaforth of Canada took San Leonardo in the centre and the PPCLI on the left were to capture the village of Villa Rogatti, two miles upstream from San Leonardo. The only clear-cut success was gained by the PPCLI who had slipped across the Moro at an unguarded ford and by dawn had captured the village in a short but savaged battle. When morning came, the Germans launched their first counter attacks along the Moro producing mixed results, and still unable to dislodge Major W.D. &quot;Bucko&quot; Watson and his company as they stood firm on the north bank...<br/><br/><br/>8 December 1943... By nightfall on 6 December, the Canadian division was across the Moro in two places. The only practicable site was the demolished bridge on the road to San Leonardo. The afternoon of 8 December the First Brigade launched a two-prong assault on San Leonardo with the RCR right hooking out of the Hasty Ps bridgehead while the 48th Highlanders of Canada would cross the Moro and attack La Torre midway between Villa Rogatti and San Leonardo. Attacking southwestwards along a long winding lane soon to be dubbed &quot;Royal Canadian Avenue&quot; the RCR would attack across the front of the 361st Panzer Grenadier Regiment. The Germans retreated and San Leonardo was at last secured, but counter-attack were the order of the day and on Thursday 9 December the German counter-attacked. Again and again the Germans swarmed around Sterlin Castle...<br/><br/><br/>23 December 1943... While the Second Brigade slogged its way yard by heartbreaking yard through Ortona's streets and alleys, General Vokes had launched an outflanking attack two miles west of the battered town. The First Brigade was to commit its three-infantry battalions supported by the tanks of the Ontario Regiment in succession. The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, the Hasty P's would lead the attack, but the two-lead assault companies soon became bogged down in the face of heavy fire. Seeing the difficulties newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel Bert Kennedy, charged forward running a gauntlet of bullets and shellfire without so much as hunching his shoulders. Kennedy quickly organized a new assault, moving up one of his reserve companies and putting out a call for the Ontario Shermans, churning in the mud somewhere to the rear....<br/><br/><br/>4 January 1944... The Canadian Army's first action of 1944 on the Adriatic front was fought by the Carleton and York Regiment exacting sweet revenge for its New Year's setback at the hands of those tough paratroopers. At Point 59, overlooking Torre Mucchia on the coast, the Germans had established two strongpoints, defended by a half-dozen machine-guns and linked by trenches, protected by barbed wire and minefields. After a daylong bombardment, a single company of Carletons attacked from two directions...<br/><br/><br/>17 January 1944... The Eleventh Canadian Infantry Brigade of the Fifth Armoured Division moved up on 12 January to relieve the weary Third Brigade and with that the First Canadian Corps had become fully operational in the Italian theatre. The brigade patrol program was barely under way when a dramatic change of plan took place. This operation to be supported by all artillery available. The Perths Regiment went in first, at 0545 hours. C-Company remained pinned down, except for a party under Lieutenant Robert Chamberlain. After fording the Ricco, Chamberlain's platoon had wiped out a three-man machine-gun post and moved up the ridge....<br/><br/>23 May 1944... The western Canadians of the Second Infantry Brigade walked into disaster. For Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry on the right, supported by the Loyal Edmonton Regiment with the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada on their left. Major Watson's company reported that it was past the barbed wire entanglements that marked the leading edge of the Hitler Line. Unable to move forward, the tanks present wonderful targets to the Panzerturms mounting 75mm guns. As tank after tank brewed, the survivors were forced to fall back to the dubious protection of the woods. At every step men fell; some were victims of Nebelwerfer fire, many were dropped by machine-gun bullets and others trod on mines scattered about the barbed wire entanglements...<br/><br/><br/>24 May 1944... By the evening of 23 May the Anzio beachhead suddenly coming to life and posing a threat to the German Tenth Army's line of communications. As the German defences crumbled, there was only one possibility of stabilizing the situation in the Liri valley. Six miles northwest of the ruptured Hitler Line, a little river meandered across the floor of the valley. Its name was the Melfa, and if the Germans could hold it, the German Tenth Army might yet be saved. Vokes Force, commanding by Lt-Colonel Vokes and consisting of his British Columbia Dragoons and the Irish Regiment of Canada would go about halfway to the Melfa and then allow Griffin Force to pass through. Vokes Force plunged into action 0757 hours on 24 May. The B-Squadron, BC Dragoons became the first Allied force to engage Mark V Panther tank. Lieutenant Taylor never forgot his shock at seeing the Panther, but fortunately he spotted the Panther before the German saw him...<br/><br/>30 May 1944... The Perths entered undefended Arnara, two miles northwest of Pofi. Beyond lay three hills code-named &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Dick&quot;, and &quot;Harry&quot;. The first two were taken with little difficulty by the Cape Breton Highlanders of Canada and the Irish Regiment of Canada respectively, and the 8th Hussars reached Ceccano. German forces were reported retreating along Route 6 and the Strathconas were ordered to cut them off. They were greeted at the crossroads near the village of Torrice by tanks, self-propelled guns and mounted infantry of the 26th Panzer Division, desperately trying to keep open this vital link....<br/><br/><br/>23 May 1944... Canadian soldiers were among the first to enter Rome. The Black Devils of the Canadian-American First Special S ervice Force (FSSF), who arrived in the embattled Anzio beachhead on 1 February, were the first liberators to enter the city. At 0630, half an hour after the start of the Canadian assault on the Hitler Line , the US VI Corps burst out its trap and launched a drive towards Valmontone. That morning the First Special Service Force with its right flank resting on the Canale Mussolini, punched towards Route 7, the fabled Via Appia, one of the two highways to Rome from the south. The Force reached the road, but a counter attack by a half dozen tanks checked any further advance that day. The tanks included a new and unbelievable monstrosity, Tiger...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.71429", "name": "The Canadians in Italy: The Spaghetti League", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Modular Board"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Advanced Squad Leader"], "usersrated": "7", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader"]}, "39693": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic405165.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["George Kelln"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2002", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Lone Canuck Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic405165_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Lone Canuck's first of three ASL scenario packs based on Canadian troop actions in Italy during WW II.

The British Eighth Army's drive stalled in the face of the stubborn and skilful German defence, Montgomery had to turn to the US 7th Army for help, only to discover that most of the Americans had gone off in the opposite direction. This forced the Eighth Army into a gruelling campaign in adverse conditions against a determined and resourceful enemy in easily defended terrain. His only chance to salvage success lay with the one formation of his army that had not fought in the desert, the First Canadian Division. Moreover, he was pinning the Eighth Army's hopes on the efforts of a single untried division of Canadians. Outside Vizzini, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment (Hasty P's) passed through the Royal Canadian Regiment as the First Brigade led the way to the paved Route 124, the infantry riding in lorries or on tanks of the Three River Regiment. The next major town was Grammichele, ten miles from Vizzini. The Hasty P's and the Three River tanks ran right into the German ambush.....<br/><br/><br/>16 July 1943... The British Eighth Army advanced had stalled on the edge of the Catania plain and General Montgomery had instructed General Leese of XXX Corps to &quot;Drive the Canadians on Hard!&quot;. The First Canadian Division began their eastward advance on Caltagirone with the 48th Highlanders proceeding cross-country. Lt-Colonel Jefferson's Loyal Edmonton Regiment and a Squadron of tanks from the Three Rivers Regiment formed the vanguard, headed for the next large town, Piazza Armerina. Just beyond San Michele di Ganzeria, Route 124 joined the Gela-Enna highway; Route 117, the highway had been hijacked from the Americans. The Loyal Eddies had smooth sailing until noon when three miles south of Piazza Armerina they ran into elements of the 15th Panzer Grenadier Division.....<br/><br/><br/>18 July 1943... While RCR clung tenaciously to the roadside a mere half-mile south of the town, Brigadier Graham had committed his remaining battalion. He sent the 48th Highlanders to take Valguarnera by making a long right hook. The Toronto regiment was to launch its final approach on Valguarnera from a ridge two-miles south of the town, but when the Highlanders arrived they found the ridge to be strongly held by the Germans. Enemy snipers and machine-gunners pinned down the Toronto infantrymen for long minutes, until an English-born corporal took matters into his own hands.....<br/><br/><br/>22 July 1943... Unlike Assoro, there was no unguarded backdoor, Leonforte had to be attacked frontally. And the town was held in strength by tanks and troops from the 104th Panzer Grenadier Regiment. A savage street battle ensued and all four Edmonton rifle companies were soon involved. With neither artillery support nor anti-tank guns, the Eddies were faced with the choice of remaining in Leonforte and being wiped out, or withdrawing to safety. The battalion commander Jim Jefferson made up his mind quickly ordering his embattled companies to pull out of Leonforte under small arms covering fire provided by the Seaforth Highlanders. At Second Brigade HQ, a despondent Brigadier-General Chris Vokes received a ten-year-old Italian boy named Antonio Guiseppe, who dodging bullets, shells and German patrols made his way to the Canadian lines to pass a message from Jefferson. Vokes acted decisively, organizing a flying column of troops from the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, four Shermans from the Three Rivers Regiment and four 6-pounders from the 90th AT-Battery and led by a PPCLI Company commander, Captain Rowan Coleman.....<br/><br/><br/>24 July 1943... The Second Brigade, which was to support the First Brigade had difficulty moving into position around Assoro and when patrols from the divisional reconnaissance unit, the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards encountered heavy fire on Route 117 near Nissoria. At noon, he signalled a 24-hour postponement in favour of a set-piece attack, supported by every available artillery piece. Under Simmonds' plan, The Royal Canadian Regiment would attack at 1500 hours advancing behind a barrage which would advance at a rate of a hundred yards every two minutes. Half-mile ahead, a smoke screen 2,000 yards long would precede the attackers and guided Kittyhawk fighter-bombers assigned to bomb and strafe targets along the road, while six squadrons of medium bombers plastered Agria and environs. A total of 5 field regiments and 2 medium regiments, over 150 guns would support one battalion.....<br/><br/><br/>2 August 1943... It fell to the Canadian troops to launch the beginning of the end of the Sicilian campaign. Temporarily attached to the British 78th Division, the Canadian Third Infantry Brigade was to mount a preliminary operation near the village of Catenanuova. The West Nova Scotia Regiment played a key role in the capture of Catenanuova. After the Royal 22nd Regiment captured Monte Scalpello, a razorback ridge towering 3,000 feet over the valley of the dry Dittaino. The 3rd Brigade had done its job, giving the 78th Division a springboard for its attack towards Centuripe. And while casualties had been light tougher times were in store for the brigade and particularly for the West Novas. While the 78th struck out for Centuripe northwest of Catenanuova, the 3rd Brigade moved cross-country to fill the narrowing gap between the 78th and the First Canadian Division further north. German prisoners warned that the paratroopers of the 3rd Fallschirmj&auml;ger Regiment held the hill.....<br/><br/><br/>4 August 1943... With the fall of Regalbuto, the Canadians had unknowingly entered the final phase of operations in Sicilian campaign. Three notable features had to seized along the way to Adrano, Hill 736, Monte Revisotto and Monte Seggio. The Loyal Eddies loaded up their ammunition, food and water as well as the 3-inch mortars and medium machine-guns of the supporting Saskatoon Light Infantry on to pack mules and headed into dry river valley. The battalion spent the nex t four days moving into position for the assault on Hill 736, clashing several times with German outposts cleverly concealed in the wilderness terrain. Major Archie Donald led the Loyal Edmontons, supported by 25-pounders from the 3rd Canadian Field Regiment, up the hill under heavy machine-gun and mortar fire.....<br/><br/><br/>5 August 1943... The loss of Agria, Regalbuto and Centruipe to XXX Corps had convinced the Germans to abandon their endangered defences in front of Catania and to withdraw into the main defensive position around the foot of Etna. Montgomery urged XXX Corps to step up its efforts to capture Adrano, the loss of which would disrupt the German defence. 4 August, the 78th Division continued its push northwards across the Salso and Simeto rivers via Route 121, while the Canadians were to capture Monte Revisotto and Monte Seggio, then force their way through the valley of the Salso.

Stepping off just after 6:00 a.m., Company A crossed its line of departure, the road that ran west out of St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle. Some 200 to 400 yards from its line of departure was a long, steep gully that ran 750 yards east to west along the battalion's front, called &ldquo;Purple Heart Draw&rdquo;. Company A did not meet stiff opposition until it reached Purple Heart Draw, then a murderous fire came from automatic weapons emplaced in houses along the road south from St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle and from the south bank of the draw... <br/> <br/>St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: Company A was being pinned down by heavy mortar and artillery fire in Purple Heart Draw; Company C, to its right had moved forward against lesser difficulties thanks in part to the assistance of the engineers of the US 2d Combat Engineer Battalion, who blasted gaping holes in the thick sides of the hedgerows for the support tanks of the 741st Tank Battalion to pass through. The men of Company C quickly followed up and by mid-morning had closed on the small chateau, which seemed heavily fortified and bristling with German machine-guns... <br/><br/><br/>St-Georges-d&rsquo;Elle France, 11 July 1944: By late morning, the 1st Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment was finally able to cross Purple Heart Draw, but had suffered heavy casualties. Meanwhile on the east side of St-Georges-d'Elle, the Germans still held the lower end of Purple Heart Draw. It was decided that in an effort to draw off any Germans from reinforcing their position in front of the 1st Battalion&rsquo;s main effort, the 3d Battalion, US 23d Infantry Regiment would launch a series of diversionary attacks.

The Germans, in a last desperate attempt to halt the US advance, were forced to commit Fallschirm Sturmgesch&uuml;tz-Brigade 12, Fallschirm Aufkl&auml;rungs-Kompanie 3, and their last reserves, Fallschirm Pionerie-Abteilung 3, in a last ditch counterattack north along the heavily-treed road towards St-Georges-d'Elle in the hopes of catching the Americans off-guard...  <br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.60714", "name": "Purple Heart Draw", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Modular Board"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Advanced Squad Leader"], "usersrated": "14", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader"]}, "39695": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Darren Fahlbusch"], "poll": [], "name": "We Built This City", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Auction/Bidding", "Commodity Speculation", "Route/Network Building"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "5", "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["OGA Games, LLC"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "City Building", "Civilization"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "We Built This City is a city building game where each player is vying to construct various public buildings throughout a walled, port city.

If they thrive, they can be worth big money &mdash; but if they go wrong, they can bankrupt your ranch.<br/><br/>In Emu Ranchers, a Decktet game for two players, each bird on your ranch is represented by a stack of cards. Cards in a single bird stack must all share a suit and must be in rank order. At the end of the hand, the value of a bird is determined by the total of the number cards in the stack. If the total is too low, then you can end up losing money on a bird. An Ace or Crown makes the stack worth more: more profit if you can cover expenses, but more loss if you can't.

The game is for 2-4 players, Ages 6 and up.<br/><br/>Each player has a coloured playing piece representing a waiter or waitress. On their turn, each player is timed using a salt pot shaker (which is effectively a timer), which is shook frantically to make the 'salt' within it drain faster. When all of the 'salt' within it reaches the bottom, the players turn is over.<br/><br/>During a players turn, the player may do as many of the following before their time runs out:<br/><br/>- roll a standard six sided die and move from the kitchen to the nearest table of their colour<br/>- on arriving at a table, the player picks up a food order disc and tries to return to the kitchen<br/>- upon reaching the kitchen (which contains a spinner), the player spins the spinner until it matches the food order they have picked up. The spinner can reveal either a blank or food. If food is displayed, the food order is ready<br/>- return back from the kitchen to the table where the order was placed, and collect a money tip<br/><br/>The first player to collect three money tips wins.<br/><br/>The game board requires some assembly, and consists of the kitchen, the tables to be served, and narrow lanes which the players move along.<br/><br/>As with many of the later Waddingtons games, it was firmly aimed at the younger end of the market, and as a consequence has limited replay value. Still, it is fast and frantic - players are constantly rolling dice and moving pieces, whilst another player is shaking the timer to end that players turn, egged on by any other players. The narrow lanes in the board do introduce a limited amount of strategy - you can block opposing players off - and the salt pot timer is a work of genius.<br/><br/>"}, "39706": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Brady Lang"], "poll": [], "name": "Dog Eat Hot Dog", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "16", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Dogs", "Food / Cooking"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic413796_t.jpg", "average": "6.15625", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["MGA Entertainment"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic413796.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A fast-paced card game where players complete and eat hot dogs as fast as they can.

The attack on Rotterdam was carried out by 700 Fallschirmj&auml;gers and in a most astonishing and daring attack, a dozen Heinkel HS 59 seaplanes ferried 120 men of the 16th Infantry Regiment into the centre of the city, where they landed on the Maas River&ndash; disembarking the men on the quayside at either end of the bridge...<br/>  <br/>Southwest of Carentan, France, 13 June 1944: The Battle for Carentan lasted three days and by June 12, the 101st Airborne Division had encircled the town in a bold pincher movement. However, just as the American paratroopers were entering the town, the German commander, Major Von der Heydte, facing encirclement and short of ammunition, had that morning ordered his forces to withdraw, and set up a new defensive line southwest of Carentan. Von der Heydte and his Fallschirmj&auml;ger Regiment 6, were now under command of the just arrived 17th SS-Panzergrenadier Division &ldquo;G&ouml;tz von Berlichingen&rdquo;, whose commander was enraged at Von der Heydte&rsquo;s withdrawal; ordered an immediate counter-attack on Carentan... <br/> <br/>East of Le Mesnil France, 7 June 1944: The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion regrouped at the Le Mesnil crossroads during the night of June 6, where it received a resupply of 3-inch mortars, which it lost in the marshes during the previous night&rsquo;s drop, and much-needed ammunition. The next morning, a strong German infantry force from the German 857th Grenadier Regiment, supported by tanks and self-propelled guns moved into position for an attack; however, were driven off by a salvo of PIAT bombs and bayonet counter-attack by B Company. The Germans withdrew 200 yards back up the road, seeking refuge in a small-fortified farmhouse, from where they continue to harass the Canadian&rsquo;s position with machine-gun fire...<br/><br/> <br/>Riethorst, Holland, 18 September 1944: For Operation Market-Garden, the 82nd Airborne Division had the onerous tasks of seizing the bridge over the Maas at Grave, the railroad bridge over the Maas-Waal Canal, the bridge over the Waal at Nijmegen; and thereafter, hold and secure, the dominating feature located southeast of Nijmegen- the Groesbeek Heights. Because of the threat of imminent attack from the Reichwald, the 1st Battalion&rsquo;s Commanding Office, Major Talton &ldquo;Woody&rdquo; Long responded by sending reinforcements to assist in the defence...<br/> <br/>Nijmegen Holland, 19 September 1944: By early afternoon of 19th, the German forces defending the two Nijmegen bridges were formidable- over 2,000 men, four 88mm guns, and numerous light anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns. Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick &ldquo;Boy&rdquo; Browning, commander of the 1st Airborne Corps told the 82nd&rsquo;s General Gavin, &ldquo;The Nijmegen Bridge must be taken today. At the latest, tomorrow.&rdquo; Gavin immediately ordered the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment to move into Nijmegen and capture the highway and the railroad bridges over the lower Waal.

Its objectives were the high ground east of Bergen, the town of Hamminkeln, and certain bridges over the Ijssel. The 1st Battalion, The Royal Ulster Rifles of the 6th Airlanding Brigade was tasked to land on LZ &ldquo;U&rdquo; to the south of Hamminkeln and seize the bridge over the Ijssel River on the main road to Brunen. D Company, commanded by Major Tony Dyball, landed on LZ &ldquo;U1&rdquo; which was astride the Ijssel, his own glider touching down in the lead about 150 yards from the bridge, which was the objective.

However, these panzer spearheads had also outraced their supply lines; forcing some 300 panzers of Heinz Guderian&rsquo;s 2nd Panzer Group to hold while their supplies caught up. Seizing upon this opportunity to destroy the German panzer force while it sat with its fuel tanks dry, the Soviet Western Front Headquarters ordered its IV Airborne Corps to detach a brigade for a special operation...<br/> <br/>Northeast of Gela, Sicily, 11 July 1943: Just over a year after its activation, the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, under the capable leadership of Colonel James M. &quot;Jumping Jim&quot; Gavin, made its first regimental size combat parachute attack as part of the Allied Invasion of Sicily known as &quot;Operation Husky.&quot;  The 505th&rsquo;s objective was to drop behind enemy lines around Gela, close off roads leading to beaches and secure the drop zone for further use...<br/><br/><br/>South of St. Come-du-Mont, France, 7 June 1944: Shortly after midnight on June 6, paratroopers of General Maxwell D. Taylor's 101st Airborne Division became the first Allied soldiers to touch French soil during the Invasion of Normandy. The 101st had been assigned the initial mission of securing Exits 1 and 2 from Utah Beach and having secured them on D-Day, Taylor immediately dispatched the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment southwest to conduct a reconnaissance towards the road junction south of St. Come-du-Mont...<br/><br/><br/>Bois de Bavent, France, 29 June 1944: By late June, the British 6th Airborne Division had settled into a defence role east of the Orne River; despite this role, the division continued to patrol aggressively, seeking and wreaking havoc upon the enemy wherever possible. At no place was this havoc more evident than in the forested area called Bois de Bavent, where a cat and mouse game was taking place between the division&rsquo;s patrols and the German&rsquo;s outposts...<br/><br/><br/>North of Heelsum, Holland, 18 September 1944: As Operation Market-Garden commenced, ad-hoc German defences were asked to oppose some of the initial paratroop landings.

The pack contains 18 scenario cards.<br/><br/>Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:<br/><br/>16 December 1944..... The village was defended by Company B, 1st Battalion, US 110th infantry Regiment and M36 tank destroyers from the 630th Tank Destroyer Battalion. Company B was well dug in and the German assault companies assaulted the village but were unable to pierce the perimeter and were forced to infiltrate the woods north and south, heading for their primary objective, Clervaux.<br/><br/><br/>16 December 1944..... The German Volksgrenadier Division 212, made a successful and relatively uneventful crossing of the Sauer around Bollendorf in the early hours, overrunning small American outposts along the river line without giving them a chance to radio a warning. Although Colonel Chance commander of the US 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division immediately opposing them was aware because of reports from the US 28th Infantry Division further north that an attack was in progress. Even though speed was of the essence, the German assault companies of Volksgrenadier Regiment 423 with their objectives the American command post in Consdorf and artillery positions in Scheidgen. Partially ignored orders to bypass pockets of resistance became involved in costly and time-consuming battle for the insignificant villages of Berdorf and Lauterborn.<br/><br/><br/>17 December 1944..... General von L&uuml;ttwitz&rsquo;s orders required Volksgrenadier Division 26 to establish bridgeheads across the river Clerf by nightfall on the 16th, so any enemy resistance had either to be subdued quickly or bypassed. As it turned out, the biggest stumbling block turned out to be the Company K, 3rd Battalion, 110th Infantry Regiment and Company B, 103d Engineer Battalion in Hosingen. The American defenders were simply too well dug in to be shifted easily and the close-range battle, with dozens of individual hand-to-hand encounters, swayed backwards and forwards all day. In the evening, four Shermans arrived from the 707th Tank Battalion, but failed to bring any rifle ammunition with them. The constant delays imposed by the defenders in the handful of villages along Skyline Drive forced KoKott to unleash his reserved Grenadier Regiment 78 whose 1st Battalion was thrown into the struggle for Hosingen, supported by a few Jagdpanzer 38(t) from Panzerj&auml;ger Abteilung 26.<br/><br/><br/>17 December 1944..... Screened by the mist which aided all of the Volksgrenadier Division 352&rsquo;s assault companies, the leading two battalions fortuitously struck at the junction between the US 109th Regiment&rsquo;s 2d Battalion, whose Company E was in F&uuml;hren and the 3d Battalion&rsquo;s Company I deployed in front of Bettendorf.

Colonel James Rudder, the commanding officer of the US 109th Infantry Regiment immediately drew upon his meagre reserves and sent A and B companies of the 1st Battalion supported by 1st Platoon Company C, 707th Tank Battalion into a counter-attack. Although progress was slow by nightfall Company A was in sight of Longsdorf and Company B was overlooking Tandel. The morning of 17 December brought as series of uncoordinated attacks by 2nd Battalion Volksgrenadier Regiment 915 against F&uuml;hren while the 1st Battalion had its hands full with the Americans counter-attacks at Longsdorf and Tandel.<br/><br/><br/>17 December 1944..... Alerted by the Seventh Armee&rsquo;s preliminary artillery barrage, Colonel Rudder moved Company G up on the right of Company F, replacing it in Brandenburg by Company C from the 109th&rsquo;s reserve 1st Battalion, which was stationed in Diekirch. During the night remembering his orders to avoid confrontation and leave American strong points to be mopped up by the reserve Fallschirm Regiment 13, Oberst Gr&ouml;schke took advantage of a wooded defile to continue advancing west in between the 109th&rsquo;s companies F and G. But early on the 17th the 2nd Platoon from Company C, 707th Tank Battalion moved into position to block the regiment. By daybreak on 18 December the GIs were completely cut off, even though they had not been attacked Colonel Rudder ordered them to fight their way out south to Diekirch helped by the tank platoon.<br/><br/><br/>17 December 1944..... Before dawn on 16 December the engineers of the Fallschirm-Pioniere Battalion 5 began ferrying the assault companies of Fallschirm Regiment 14 across the Our. Their instructions were to head as rapidly as possible west to the river Clerf, establish a bridging site near Kautenbach and press on west to Wiltz to establish a blocking line behind the river S&ucirc;re south of Bastogne. Their line of advance actually lay at the intersection of Lt-Colonel James Rudder&rsquo;s US 109th and 110th Infantry Regiments and immediately in their path at Weiler was Company I, 3rd Battalion 110th Infantry Regiment. Generalmajor Ludwig Heilmann&rsquo;s orders to both his 14th and 15th Regiments called on them to bypass any pockets of resistance in the villages. Leaving those to be mopped up later by his reserve 13th Regiment. One such village was defended by six 105mm and three 75mm Shermans from Company C 707th Tank Battalion and a part of the 110th Regiment&rsquo;s anti-tank company.<br/><br/><br/>19 December 1944..... By early evening Volksgrenadier Regiment 916 had command of the heights in the Our/S&ucirc;re triangle and Volksgrenadier Regiment 914 taking up its place in the centre of the division&rsquo;s line, could begin to make more headway. The US 109th Regiment with Colonel Rudder&rsquo;s command post back in Ettelbruck was now formed in an arc in front of Diekirch. However, it was a sadly depleted regiment. So far the Volksgrenadier Division 352 was handsomely repaying Colonel Rudder for his audacity on Omaha Beach six months earlier.<br/><br/><br/>20 December 1944..... While Panzer Lehr was still struggling toward the Clerf River on 18 December, Panzer Division 2 was rolling west across the river through Clervaux. In the van, was the reinforced Aufkl&auml;rungs Abteilung commanded by Hauptmann von B&ouml;hm. Taking the road which skirt to the north of Donnange and Lullange, the Kampfgruppe ran into the first of the Bastogne roadblocks at the Antoniushof farm road junction a task force from CCR/9th Armored Division. The next opposition lay at Baraque d&rsquo;Allerborn, where a second task force of CCR/9th Armored Division was waiting. Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm attacked here at dusk and within 15 minutes destroyed 24 Shermans. Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm had its last encounter with the Bastogne roadblocks at Herbaimont on 20 December, which was manned by an outpost of the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division.<br/><br/><br/>20 December 1944..... General der Panzertruppe Eugen Walter Kr&uuml;ger&rsquo;s LVIII Korps encountered difficulty when the Aufkl&auml;rung-Abteilung 146 found that the bridge over the river Ourthe west of Bertogne had been blown. Kr&uuml;ger then ordered Panzer Division 116 to retrace its footsteps and head northwest through Houffalize towards La Roche and Sam&eacute;e instead. The US 7th Armored Division&rsquo;s trains were at La Roche, but their main supply depot had been moved to just outside Sam&eacute;e. Early in the afternoon of 20 December, Panzer Grenadier 60 began assembling in the woods south of Sam&eacute;e while Panzer Grenadier 16 prepared to attack straight down the road, with Volksgrenadier Regiment 1129 on its right. The US 7th Armored Division&rsquo;s quartermaster delayed destroying the supply dump because he was told a task force from CCR/3rd Armored Division was on it way to Sam&eacute;e. CCR was only able to send a small armoured force commanded by Major John Tucker and consisted of a company of Shermans, a troop armoured Cars, a platoon of light tanks and a battery of M7s. Task Force Tucker moved into Sam&eacute;e from the north.<br/><br/><br/>20 December 1944..... After helping Oberst Heniz Kokott&rsquo;s Volksgrenadier in their final assault against Holtzthum, Oberst Paul von Hauser&rsquo;s Kampfgruppe 901 followed the rest of Panzer Lehr, which had already crossed the Clerf at Drauffet. The division&rsquo;s reinforced Aufkl&auml;rungs-Abteilung, Kampfgruppe von Fallois and the following Kampfgruppe 902 had had a brief skirmish at Eschweiler just north of Wiltz but Bayerlein left the subjugation to this thorn in the division&rsquo;s flank to the following Volksgrenadiers and Fallschirmj&auml;gers. However the Bastogne defences, which a day earlier had lain wide open were now being rapidly reinforced as the 101st Airborne Division deployed. Company I, III/501st Parachute Infantry Regiment started entering the village of Wardin from the northwest, unseen in thick morning mist. Part of Panzer Lehr&rsquo;s Aufkl&auml;rungs-Abteilung moved into Wardin from the northeast at the same time and the two groups inevitably collided in the middle.<br/><br/><br/>23 December 1944..... The biggest problem faced by Oberst Hans-Joachim Kahler&rsquo;s F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade, is that it was committed piecemeal and unable to launch a full-scale counter-attack against either of the American III Corps&rsquo; division it ran up against, the 26th in the west and the 80th in the east. Called out of OKW Reserve on 22 December the brigade was originally intended to cross the S&ucirc;re at Ettelbruck and then head directly to the support of Fallschirm Division 5 around Martelange but the threat posed to Ettelbruck by the arrival of the US 80th Infantry Division caused this to be amended. Kahler put one company of F&uuml;siliers apiece into Eschdorf and Heiderscheid and sent two south with a platoon of Panthers to Grevils-Br&eacute;sil hoping to establish contact with the leading Regiment of the Volksgrenadier Division 352. The American 80th Divisional Commander, Major-General Willard Paul, had decided earlier that the ground was unsuitable for tanks so for once it was the GI&rsquo;s who had no armor support.<br/><br/><br/>24 December 1944..... Recognizing that Fallschirm Division 5 was out on a limb and although Volksgrenadier Division 352 had finally captured Diekirch that a wide and dangerous gap had opened between the two divisions. Heersgruppe B Commander Field Marshall Model reassigned the former to LII Korps on 22 December and reinforced it with the F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade. At the same time he also released Oberst Alois Weber&rsquo;s under strength Volksgrenadier Division 79 from reserve and assigned it to Kniess&rsquo; LXXXV Korps. The village was weakly defended by Colonel Bandy&rsquo;s 2d Battalion US 319th Infantry Regiment who had captured in a fierce fight the night before from the F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade. The F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade StuG&rsquo;s and Sdkfz 251&rsquo;s would spearhead the attack.<br/><br/><br/>24 December 1944..... The Battle of the Bulge was only days old and Fritz Bayerlin&rsquo;s Panzer-Lehr Division pressing westward throughout the day. Kampfgruppe von Poschinger took St. Hubert without any resistance late that night. The advance continued towards the important road centre of Rochefort. Early the 23 December the town was shelled and a German reconnaissance patrol was sent in and reported that the town was empty. Rochefort was in fact well defended by some of the US 3rd Battalion, 335th Infantry Regiment reinforced by with Regimental anti-tank guns and one platoon each from the 638th Tank Destroyer Battalion, 309th Engineer Combat Battalion and 29th(Separate) Infantry Regiment. At about 0200 hours, Panzer-Lehr Division resumed the advance and was stopped by intense crossfire. Bayerlin was forced to set up a systematic and time-consuming attack. The American defenders fought back stubbornly from house to house. The Panzer Lehr&rsquo;s field guns were brought up to pound the eastern approaches. Then supported by weight of Panthers the Grenadiers of Poschinger&rsquo;s Kampfgruppe launched their assault crossing the L&rsquo;homme River by early afternoon.<br/><br/><br/>24 December 1944..... The intention was to cut the Hotton-Marche road capture Marche and advance toward Ciney on the right flank of Panzer Division 2. Brigadier General Boiling&rsquo;s US 84th Infantry Division had deployed along a 12-mile defensive front from Hotton to Jamodenne west of Marche. Von Waldenburg began his attack towards the Hotton-Marche road by infiltrating two companies of his Aufkl&auml;rung-Abteilung 146 through the woods southwest of Verdenne on a ridge just to the north of the village. This lay at the junction of the 84th Infantry Division&rsquo;s 334th and 335th Regiments outflanking them both. They were detected and thrown back in an American counter attack at noon on Christmas Eve. At the same time Oberst Voightsberger&rsquo;s Panzergrenadier Regiment 156 supported by five panzers from I/Panzer Regiment 16 launched the main assault against Verdenne.<br/><br/><br/>25 December 1944..... By midday of 23 December, Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm had reached Buissonville and by nightfall was just outside Ach&ecirc;ne, only 20 kilometres from the Meuse at Dinant. Montgomery was given command of Allied ground forces in the northern sector of the bulge, had begun deploying British forces to support the American defences and the under strength 3rd Royal Tank Regiment was now at Dinant. During the night 23-24 December, patrols scouted out the positions of Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm and shellfire began rain down around Foy-Notre-Dame. Sherman Fireflies with high-velocity 17-pounder guns took a toll on the Panthers on Christmas Eve blocking von B&ouml;hm&rsquo;s planned attack towards Anseremme, just south of Dinant. For Kampfgruppe von B&ouml;hm things turned from bad to worst as low on fuel and ammunition and now cut off with no realistic chance of resupply, the Allies struck.<br/><br/>30 December 1944..... The forces immediately facing Generalleutnant Karl Decker&rsquo;s XXXIX Korps were the under strength US 134th Infantry Regiment of the 35th Infantry Division around Lutrebois and the US 137th Regiment around Villers-la-Bonne-Eau with companies K and L actually in the village itself. The attack on Villers-la-Bonne-Eau began at 0445 hours on 30 December with Fallschirm Regiment 14 leading companies closely following the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s attached 501 schwere SS-Panzer Abteilung seven Tiger II&rsquo;s.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.6", "name": "Wacht Am Rhein", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Modular Board"], "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": ["Advanced Squad Leader"], "usersrated": "5", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader", "World War 2: Battle of the Bulge"]}, "39724": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic407963.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["George Kelln"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2003", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Lone Canuck Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic407963_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "The 2nd Lone Canuck ASL scenario module for the famed German Grossdeutschland unit.

When the 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron reached the high ground to the north of the small village of Kulewka. There it observed a force of seven Russian light tanks laden with infantry moving into and occupying the village. The German halftracks loaded with infantry roared into the opposite end of the village...<br/><br/><br/>2 July 1942... Infantry Regiment GD 2 of the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland reported no significant combat operations along the southern flank. This was soon too change. A divisional order, which was issued during the night of 1-2 July, ordered Infantry Regiment GD 2 to eliminate a dangerous flanking threat to the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland and Panzer Division 24 prior to them proceeding with the advance. Early on the sunny morning of 2 July, the infantry moved towards Gorschetschnoje from the north...<br/><br/><br/>22 September 1942... The Operation was named &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; and was undertaken by the 2nd and 3rd Companies of the Sturm-Pioniere Battalions GD and supported by the Artillery Regiment GD. The artillery observers were directly assigned to accompany the pioneers on the assault and would then be able to call in fire in support immediately, meanwhile the Sturm-pionieres, armed with satchel charges, hand grenades, flamethrowers, spades and knives would clear out the bunkers..<br/><br/><br/>30 September 1942... This would be last day Infantry Division 72 and the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland would carried out offensive operations, albeit with limited objectives. On the right was Kampfgruppe Grosser consisting of the 1st and 3rd Battalions of Infantry Regiment 2 GD supported by the Panzer Battalion GD. The infantry moved forward as the artillery opened fire. Despite heavy defensive fire from the other side, the attack made good progress. Oberst Garski personally directed the infantry's assault on the position from the turret of a command tank, using it's radio to direct the artillery on the dug-in Soviet positions...<br/><br/><br/>27 November 1942... The Soviet offensive began on 24 November 1942 as expected without immediately revealing its points of main effort, however. Instead, the Soviets applied pressure all along the German Ninth Army's front, hoping to find the weakest spots in the German main line of resistance. These were revealed in the afternoon, when alarming reports of significant breakthroughs came in from the area south of Bely, in the Luchesa Valley. The result of the large number of reports coming in from all sectors of the XXIII Army Corps was the hasty alerting of the Infantry Division Grossdeutschland and an order to send individual Kampfgruppe as Fire Brigades to the threatened points...<br/><br/><br/>1 December 1942... Saw the heaviest fighting for the Grossdeutschland Division in the Luchesa Valley. Three Soviet Divisions began attacking at dawn. Following very thorough artillery preparation the tanks and infantry began their advance against the German strongpoints. Numerous Soviet tanks, some with mounted infantry streamed out of the woods. The way to main road, the lifeline not only of the Grossdeutschland Division, but the entire German Ninth Army again appeared to be open before the Russian advance...<br/><br/><br/>10 February 1943... On 14 January 1943, the Soviet launched their third attack across the Don towards the Donets, the full weight of which mainly struck the Hungarian Second Army. The desired breakthrough was achieved quickly simultaneously roll up the Hungarian divisions along the Don north of the breakthrough point from the south. The Soviets spearheads veered north and Northwest on a broad front, placing the German Second Army in extreme danger...<br/><br/><br/>14 March 1943... The Red Army's assault which came in during the bitterly cold night of 18 February struck and rolled over the remnants of a Grenadier company of the Grossdeutschland.

Bidding continues for all players, clockwise, until the dealer is reached.  The dealer can then bid any number of cards, EXCEPT whatever number would make the total number of bids equal to the number of cards dealt.

Player four can then bid any number but 1, as that would equal five total bids, which is the number of cards dealt.<br/><br/>The player sitting to the dealer's left also throws the first card.  Tricks are taken by the highest numerical card.  The Excuse can either be played as a &quot;win trick&quot; or &quot;lose trick&quot;.  Players who bid correctly gain 10 points, those one trick off from their bid score 0, those two tricks off score -10, those three tricks off score -20, those four tricks off score -30, and those five tricks off score -40.<br/><br/>Phases in odd numbered rounds are dealt as follows: 5 cards, 4 cards, 3 cards, 2 cards, and 1 card placed on the forehead for all players but the card holder to see.

When 2 cards are placed on the forehead, cards are still played singly, with the first card chosen randomly.<br/><br/>Game length is variable, but typically ends after everyone has dealt twice.

There is a double-armed spinner.<br/><br/>Each player selects two men of the same colour and places them in the corner to his right on the board. The aim is to get both men into the centre of the board first.<br/><br/>The player with lowest sum total on the spinner starts the game.  Each player must spin a 5 on one arm of the spinner or a total of five to move. Double five means he can move both men.<br/><br/>A man moves out on a five then forward as many spaces as shown on the other arm of the spinner. Once out the man is moved according to the numbers on one or both arms of the spinner. Certain spaces on the board allow a player to split the total of his spinner count. Exact count on both arms of the spinner is required to bring a man home.<br/><br/>Landing on an opponent means he is &quot;butted off&quot; and has to start again, while the &quot;butt-er&quot; man moves forward 20 spaces. Like Ludo, if a player manages to get both men on the same space it is called a Block and no other player can pass. There are penalty spaces on the board (miss a turn, go back). Spinning a double allows a second turn. Three consecutive doubles sends the man closest to the centre of the board home again, and there are a few other rules to apply during play.<br/><br/>"}, "39766": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Pass 'N Punt", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1910", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: American Football / Gridiron"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic415941_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Arnold Specialty Co."], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic415941.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Box is approx. 1 3/16&quot; x 5 3/16&quot; x 11 1/8&quot; and Reads - PASS'N PUNT Miniature Football DeLuxe Card Table Game, ARNOLD SPECIALTY CO BURBANK, CAL.<br/><br/>Most parts are wood, with cotton packing under pieces.

Your goal is to figure out the space monster&rsquo;s weaknesses and stop it before it eats everyone on the space station &ndash; including you!

You may also have to go to specific rooms to perform tasks, like restarting the failing generator, pumping up the life support system, or overriding the safety systems on the airlock.  Each player gets one action per turn and an allotment of movement points.  The monster also gets at least one action and move every turn.<br/><br/>Space Monster uses a modular, card-based board, special powers for each player, a deck of special powers for the monster, and an unusual deck-based hit point system for the monster.  When the monster takes damage, it loses cards from its health deck.  When all damage is dealt, the instructions on the card on top the the discarded health cards tells you how the monster reacts.  If you draw the special Dying Gasp card, you know the monster is almost dead.<br/><br/>Space Monster is a fairly complex game. As such, it is appropriate for ages 14 and up.

The first game released was The Quest for the Rings!, with gameplay somewhat similar to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and a storyline reminiscent of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings'. (from Wikipedia).<br/><br/>Without explicitly mentioning names, this game presents itself as a playable sequel to the 'The Lord of the Rings'.<br/><br/>This semi-cooperative game is a 'DVD' type board game (but done before invention of the DVD). The game is played on a game board, but battles are resolved using the Magnavox Odyssey&sup2; video game console.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, one player is determined to be the evil Ringmaster player: that player sets up the game board by strategically hiding the 10 'Ring' tokens under the (four secret types of) Castles, accompanying some of them with 'Nightmare' or 'Dragon' tokens.<br/><br/>The game board is used to track the locations of the 10 hidden Rings, the castle types (dungeon, crystal cavern, shifting hall, or infernal inferno), and the monsters. Dragons, once revealed, can be moved to adjacent unoccupied castles by the Ringmaster. Movement on the board is point to point (city to city, or port to port).<br/><br/>The (cooperating) hero players have a set number of turns (tracked via a token on the game board) to recover the 10 Rings of power; if they cannot, the Ringmaster wins.<br/><br/>At the start of a battle, buttons are pushed corresponding to the state of the tokens on the game board: this programs a configuration (location and enemies) for each battle. The players have to choose which characters to use (max of two: wizard, warrior, phantom, or changeling) to enter each battle. The Ringmaster can spend from a limited supply of 'Possession' tokens to take over a character for a battle.<br/><br/>In the two player version, one of the players plays both the Ringmaster and a hero, and has a modified rule-set for his allowed behaviors.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Rulebook (full color)<br/>Game board (laminated hardboard)<br/>23 'Castle' tokens (raised-plastic): printed on underside as 4 types: Dungeons, Crystal Caverns, Infernoes, Shifting Halls - there is room under each Castle for two stacked metal tokens.<br/>17 round tokens (raised-metal !): 3 Dragon, 3 Nightmare, 10 Rings, 1 Quest<br/>1 rectangular 'Hourglass' token (plasticard?)<br/>8 rectangular 'Possessions' tokens (plasticard?)<br/>1 Keyboard Overlay (laminated)<br/>1 Magnavox Odyssey&sup2; game cartridge<br/><br/>"}, "39775": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1196154.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Andrea Chiarvesio", "Luca Iennaco"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Mad4GameStyle"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Edge Entertainment", "Fantasy Flight Games", "Hobby World", "Stratelibri", "Truant Spiele", "Ubik"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1196154_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["City Building", "Dice", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Medieval"], "boardgamehonor": ["2009 Golden Geek Best Board Game Expansion Nominee", "2010 Golden Geek Best Board Game Expansion Nominee"], "description": "The expansion is composed by five &quot;modules&quot;.

You might also find the odd passenger who wants to travel to civilization.<br/><br/>However, standing in your way is the local farmer, who really does not want you to build on his land. Fortunately you can buy favours from the necessary government committee to deal with such irritations. You will also need a few contacts with other train companies, as you will need their second-hand engines to run on your lines. Finally, once you've sucked all the profit that you can from a route, you must off-load it to a major train company before you are saddled with the losses.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Warfrog Games Treefrog Line edition"], "average": "7.15924", "name": "Last Train to Wensleydale", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Route/Network Building"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "928", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: England", "Treefrog Line"]}, "39928": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Intimate Commands", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1985", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic417425_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Command Enterprises"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic417425.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Mature / Adult"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A roll and move game (move around the outside of the board style), where players are asked to do things like 'Remove One Piece of Apparel', and 'Take A Drink'.

From approximately 1700 BC to 1200 BC (which was the abrupt end of the Bronze Age) the chariot reigned supreme on the battlefield. It was the first modern weapons system, and chariots controlled most of warfare until actual cavalry appeared in the middle of the Iron Age.<br/>  <br/>But how did chariots work as a tactical weapons system? There is no complete historical agreement on what exactly they did or how they were used, but Chariots of Fire will show you our view of their many applications - and many types of chariotry there were - providing GBoH players with the complete and definitive chariot rules. These rules cover combat and mobility from the first battle wagons of the Sumerians to the two-man, fast-moving light chariots of the Egyptians, often complete with their associated and specialized Runner Infantry, to the heavy 3-man Hittite wheels.<br/> To simulate these ancient tactical details Chariots of Fire presents you with nine battles:<br/>Sumer (ca 2320 BC) - featuring the legendary Sargon the Great<br/>Sekhmen (1875 BC)<br/>Megiddo (ca 1479 BC)<br/>Senzar (1470)<br/>The Astarpa (1312 BC)<br/>Kadesh (1300 BC)<br/>Nihriya (1230 BC)<br/>Babylon (1225 BC)<br/>and Troy (1200 BC) - including an extra: Homer's heros!<br/><br/>And of armies Chariots of Fire has plenty, and a truly colorful bunch they are: Sumerians, Akkadians, all sorts of Egyptians, Canaanites, Hittites, Mitanni, Arzawans, Assyrians, Babylonians, and the Myceaen Age Greeks.<br/><br/>Game Features<br/>TIME SCALE     20 minutes per turn  <br/>MAP SCALE     100 yards per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE      350 men per mounted unit <br/>PLAYING TIME     1-3 hours<br/><br/><br/>(from BGG description:)<br/><br/>Historical Note: The period following The Bronze Age, from what is known as The Catastrophe of ca. 1200 BC to the rise of the Greek city-states, is almost totally devoid of any sort of information, and that includes archaeological  remains.

Fontenoy is a tight test between the greatest captain of the war - Maurice de Saxe, commanding French forces behind defensive works against the inexperienced Duke of Cumberland commanding a mixed group of Allied troops.  Aside from the classic, historical battle in which the Allies try to breach the French defenses, variants will allow players to explore options which allow the Allies to outflank the French, add more forces to both sides, and even take away the French defenses for a straight-up contest on the plains of Flanders.  Fontenoy retains all of the aspects of the previous games of the series set in the Seven Years War.  The scale is 100 yards per hex and 20 minute game turns, with infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries at the scale of 1 strength point equals 100 foot soldiers, 50 horsemen, or 2 cannon.<br/><br/>Also included is the Battle of Melle, 9 July, 1745.  This is a complete battle with a small number of counters per side, played out on a half size map.

Using a quick-playing, card-driven game system, each player assumes the role of a French soldier -- or grognard -- starting out as a young sergeant or sous-lieutenant trying to make it in life beginning in 1792. Fortunately for the enterprising grognard, he can look forward to over twenty years of almost continuous war provided courtesy of the Directory and Napol&eacute;on!<br/><br/>Game play is broken down into a series of campaign seasons that span the period from the Brunswick Manifesto in 1792 to The Hundred Days of 1815. Each campaign season consists of a number of 'In Garrison' rounds and 'On Campaign' rounds. During these rounds, major historical events take place, from the arrest and execution of Louis XVI to the coronation of Napol&eacute;on, from great battles to the &quot;whiff of grapeshot.&quot; History is fixed, with events happening like they actually did, that is, with one exception: will the English christen that climactic battle of 1815 The Battle of Waterloo or will the victorious French name it La Bataille de Mont Saint Jean?!<br/><br/>Against this historical backdrop, grognards take advantage of the opportunities that Fate provides to advance their station in life. Will you be lucky enough to be assigned to the Army of the Orient with Napol&eacute;on himself or will you be marooned in the Army of the Rhine et Moselle? Will you exhibit reckless bravery under the Emperor&rsquo;s eye at Austerlitz, or will you sit out the 1805 campaign, recovering from wounds suffered in a pointless minor skirmish? It&rsquo;s both up to you and to Fate. Each grognard has a number of qualities that are key to game play:<br/><br/><br/>     Rank: From Sergent to Marechal (is there a baton in your knapsack?)<br/>     Title and Office: Reserved only for the most senior grognards<br/>     Legion of Honor: Has your bravery been suitably recognized?<br/>     Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s Notice: You can&rsquo;t command a regiment without this<br/>     Glory: Are you known as a bold fire-eater, forever brave?<br/>     Money: Has fortune shined on you in more tangible ways?<br/>     Health: Will the predations of war force you into retirement?<br/>     Charm: Of course; this is a game about Frenchmen, n'est pas?<br/>     Fencing: Useful for skewering a fellow grognard who insults you<br/>     Standing: Does your commander hold you in high esteem or contempt?<br/><br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Winning the game is achieved in a number of ways: having the highest award in the Legion of Honor, having the highest military rank, or having the most glory or wealth. The game is entirely suitable for  solitaire play through six players (and perhaps even a few more).

The end result is an innovative mix that gives you the best of both worlds!<br/><br/><br/>        ....<br/><br/><br/>        The first phase is the release of a LCG Core Set. Every LCG will have an amazing, high quality and widely available entry point packed with content, including high-quality game pieces and immersive game aides to enhance the game. Core Sets are completely self-contained, with multiple decks included, providing a great game experience right out of the box.<br/><br/><br/>        The Core Sets are followed by monthly installments of expansion packs, each a set of forty fixed cards, providing an ongoing and regular addition to the available card pool. These expansion packs add customization, variety, and an ongoing &ldquo;story&rdquo; to everyone&rsquo;s experience with the Core Game.&quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Starting with the

With modern tanks from Czechoslovakia and modern artillery and planes from Italy, South America's first unit of paratroopers and a battalion of marines, Peru unleashed its blitzkrieg in July 1941. The war lasted for seven weeks, ending with a crushing Peruvian victory as Ecuador was forced to hand over half of the territory claimed by the Quito government.<br/><br/>War on the Equator is a supplement for the Panzer Grenadier system based on the battles waged between Peru and Ecuador in 1941. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front and Road to Berlin. There are six scenarios, each based on an actual battle and featuring tank assaults, parachute landings, amphibious assaults, horsed cavalry and river gunboat operations.<br/><br/>War on the Equator is sold exclusively via PDF download. The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed.
