In the final battle, the last vestiges of mankind construct a fortified city to hold the Daemonic hordes at bay. Within this city, massive corporations vie for power, Daemonic Kults carve a bloody swath through its citizenry, and technology has surpassed the limits of the flesh. Take care when choosing your allies, even more when choosing your enemies. This is the Zone. Obsidian allows the player to take control over any type of character, from the infernal kultist to the self proclaimed messiah.

However, as I am the designer, I may be somewhat biased in this.<br/><br/>Powers and Perils is dedicated, first and foremost, to creating unlimited variation and possibilities as simply and easily as possible. This does not mean that, in all cases, the systems that are contained in this game are simple and easy. It does mean that, given the detail and variability that the game provides, it can be used by nearly anyone with a minimal amount of effort....<br/><br/>The Character Generation system is designed with one purpose in mind: to create detailed and unique characters, of either sex, in any of four races [human, elf, dwarf, and faerry], each time that they are used. The factors generated are used throughout play. Unlike some other systems, they are not rolled and forgotten. Each characteristic that is determined for a character has some use that will be important to the character's success and survival. These uses are detailed throughout the first book and many of the basic formulae that are applied in using them are included on the Character Record Sheet.<br/><br/>Second, the characteristic system reflects both the native ability, i.e. genotypical potential, of the character and the effect that his interests have on the person that he becomes. Within the realistic limits that nature imposes on him, each character has the capability of being anything that he wants to be - depending on how his interests modify his ability.<br/><br/>Third, major sections of the Character Generation system are designed to reflect the events and experience that the character would have had before his creation for use in the game. The optional Special Events section reflects major events, lucky twists of fate and other influences during his life. The range of events is quite extensive and some may require the adjudication of the Referee. The major factor reflecting the Character's past is the Initial Increase Factor. This is determined by the Age and Station characteristics, plus a random roll. These points are allocated to acquiring experience, expertise, wealth and characteristic points, which improve a character's starting characteristic values.<br/><br/>Another feature of the system is the Special Attribute section. This section details factors that can be gained as Special Events, reflecting mystical ties and disabilities that the character may have (either because of some past event or because of his nature). The forces range from curses to awesome mental and physical powers that transcend the normal limits of the magic system.<br/><br/>All in all, a Powers and Perils character is the most unique individual that you can create in any role-playing system. His capabilities can directly influence the course of the game. He is not a paper illusion, but a heroically real and exciting individual who is intimately a part of his world.&quot;<br/><br/>User Summary:<br/><br/>The Powers and Perils basic set contains 5 books:<br/><br/>- Book 1: The Character Book (44 pages)<br/>- Book 2: The Combat and Magic Book (52 pages)<br/>- Book 3: The Creature Book (60 pages)<br/>- Book 4: The Book of Human Encounters and Treasure (52 pages)<br/>- Book 5: &quot;County Mordara&quot; (24 pages), an adventure module set in the Mordara section of the continent described in the Perilous Lands module.<br/><br/>"}, "53575": {"rpgitemversion": {"214243": "2001 PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Knight's Sword", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic558963.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": {"387": "Dragonlance"}, "rpgproducer": {"16300": "Sarah Feggestad"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"244": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)"}, "average": "6.33333", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"2667": "DLQ - Dragonlance Quests"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic558963_t.jpg", "description": "From back cover:<br/><br/>Est Sularus oth Mithas: My Honor is My Life.

To reach the battle zone, a two week sea voyage is necessary.  After one week at sea, the ship is caught in a terrible storm which lasts three days.  Late one night, when the storm finally relents, the ship finds itself in unfamiliar waters with the rudder and mainmast destroyed.  After a few hours adrift, during which the crew tries various schemes to build a makeshift rudder and find out where you are, calm seas suddenly explode under the fury of a huge serpent; a toothed snake with six tentacles like those of a squid.  It attacks with complete surprise and totally destroys the ship before any effective defense can be given.  In the heat of the attack, the captain's voice is heard: &quot;Abandon ship!&quot; and &quot;Every man for himself!&quot;<br/><br/>Can you face the horrors that thrive on the Serpent Islands?

The town is constructed on a rock bluff where the River Nemo is joined by the Urt River, an area that encompasses about one square mile. The town proper is comprised of 19 districts, fenced in by walls, towers, bastions, and gatehouses. Five more districts, &quot;The Outs&quot;,comprise its suburban areas, most of which are east, across the Yggsburgh Canal. Together these 24 districts make up the ordered and prosperous Free Town of Yggsburgh.<br/> The Castle Zagyg City Expansion series explores each district of the Free Town in tremendous detail. Individually treated each inter-connecting district is presented in its own book with accompanying maps.

Behind the A4 glossy cover lies 84 pages of well researched and informative articles dedicated to Chaosium's Cthulhu Now and Pagan Publishing's Delta Green settings. The first issue (Winter 2001/2002) entitled 'Strange Britain, Secret Country' concentrates on CoC/DG activities in the UK and contains nearly 20 articles ranging from new NPCs and Delta Green PISCES material, through to the start of a new UK-based DG campaign and a mythos gazetteer of the British Isles - to name just a few.<br/><br/>To thoroughly cover all the material in the magazine would make this a very long review, however a brief overview of the current contents may be worthwhile to whet the appetite. They are as follows:<br/><br/>'Unusual suspects' - two detailed NPCs with attendant adventure hooks and player handouts.<br/><br/>'Mental Health in the United Kingdom' - a factual introduction to modern mental health laws, including information on institutions and a selection of adventure seeds.<br/><br/>'Let Sleeping Gods Lie' - a new PISCES section 'H', dealing with the UK's historical and archaeological legacy of the Mythos. A well-researched piece providing a potentially very useful organisation for Keepers to use.<br/><br/>'Dangerous Places' - describing a Mythos locale with possible adventure ideas.<br/><br/>'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' - procuring illegal firearms in the UK. A much needed article for anyone running modern day adventures.<br/><br/>'The Further Files of Prof. Grant Emerson' - following on from the Delta Green: Countdown reports. Here detailing the aftermath of a run-in with a servant of Glaaki.<br/><br/>'With Extreme Prejudice...' - detailing JAGUAR special forces groups which fill a similar role to MJ-12's NRO Delta agents.<br/><br/>'Zodiac Clearance' &amp; 'Drive Through Carefully' - the beginnings of a British DG campaign where an idyllic piece of little England is not what it seems (is it ever?); with a simple yet fetching hand drawn map and well produced handouts.<br/><br/>'Tale of Terror (s)' - Steve Hatherley's legacy lives on. A couple of tales for Cthulhu Now and Delta Green.<br/><br/>'A Landscape of the Stones' - an examination of stone circles, standing stones and ley lines. Highly readable and well researched with useful 'box out' texts for rapid assimilation of information and ideas. There is also an excellent bibliography that makes one realise just how lacking other articles often are in this department.<br/><br/>'The Tombola Cipher' - your very own secret code based on the UK National lottery results! This feels like a blast from the past - pages of tables for Players and Keepers to devour. Yet to be tried, but looks fun.<br/><br/>'Firearms of the UK and Irish Police and Military' - the corollary of the 'Lock, stock...' article. Weaponry as used by government agencies. As much gun information as most sane people would ever want to know. Some may remember Pagan Publishing's 'Weapons Compendium' in a similar vein.<br/><br/>'The Mythos Gazetteer of the British Isles' - literary and RPG Mythos happenings in Britain. An update to that which originally published in Games Workshop's 'Green and Pleasant Land' (1987). Good clear maps. The Gazetteer covers all eras. If it's updated again I would like to see an additional key to identify exactly which era an entry belongs to, making life a little easier for Keepers.<br/><br/>'British Investigator Templates' - a list of military and civilian agency profiles and character templates in the style of Delta Green: Countdown; ranging from 16 Air Assault Brigade and the Ghurkhas, through to the BBC, the Nuclear Safety Directorate and more.<br/><br/>'Green Box' - the latest gear for the well-equipped investigator. Featuring the Heckler &amp; Koch MP7 PDW, the SB-100 series secure briefcase and the Casio GPS Watch. Lovely photos, lovely kit. Now I know what I want for Christmas...<br/><br/>'Reviews' - no magazine would be complete without a review section. Here Nick Brownlow casts a critical eye over two recent Chaosium products: 'Ramsey Campbell's Goatswood and Less Pleasant Places', and 'Unseen Masters'. My own review of Unseen Masters is somewhat more generous, as always each reviewer has their own take, and it all provides more information for the prospective buyer.<br/><br/>Finally there is a one page piece on 'What is the Black Seal?' and an afterword by the Editor Adam Crossingham (there is no introductory editorial). AC explains the reasoning behind starting 'The Black Seal' and the advantages of running modern day CoC games. Of particular interest are brief details of the forthcoming issues. The next is a PISCES special, looking at Britain&rsquo;s Paranormal Intelligence Section for Counter-intelligence, Espionage and Sabotage and a later issue deals with Cthulhu and the 'Nam...<br/><br/>"}, "53943": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Black Seal (Issue 3 - Winter 2003)", "rpgproducer": {"20822": "Adam Crossingham"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic538123.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "8.5", "rpgissue": {"2308": "The Black Seal"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"52845": "Cages"}, "rpg": {"2308": "The Black Seal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"9705": "Softcover version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic538123_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;This planet is haunted by us; the other occupants just evade boredom by filling our skies and seas with monsters.&quot; - John Keel<br/><br/><br/>Alien cultures.

The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.<br/><br/>Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.<br/><br/>A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types, so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.<br/><br/>Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this, players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.<br/><br/>The basic Thunderstone framework was updated in the implementation of Thunderstone: Advance.<br/><br/>Integrates with<br/><br/><br/>    Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin<br/>    Thunderstone: Dragonspire<br/>    Thunderstone: Starter Set<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"167677": "Alderac Print & Play edition"}, "boardgameintegration": {"85897": "Thunderstone: Dragonspire"}, "average": "7.00359", "name": "Thunderstone", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "9074", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5666": "Solitaire Games"}}, "53954": {"rpg": {"13236": "AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dragons of Weng T'Sen", "rpgproducer": {"1466": "Cory Glaberson"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic537306.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"9716": "First Printing"}, "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"457": "Role Aids"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic537306_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>The Emperor has forbidden his subjects to enter the valley.
