Most Famously &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; John Hawkwood, Albertico da Barbiano, Cesare Borgia and Cosimo de&rsquo; Medici all fought as condottiere in various Italian Wars. Conflicts ranged from skirmishes to large scale battles of thousands of heavily armored soldiers fighting to fulfill their contracted duties.

While touring the country by train, you will have the opportunity to perform while adding talent to your show through hiring the performers stranded in cities by defunct circuses. Just remember to keep an eye on your wages, because your talent definitely will.<br/><br/>Through clever card hand management, you control the movement of your train around the American northeast, making strategic business decisions about talent, performances and payroll in this fast-paced strategy game.

Deadpool frequently breaks the fourth wall and verbally interacts with the player based on their skill and progress. For instance, in the options menu, he begins to tap the glass of the television set, before asking, &ldquo;Hey, got any girls in there?&rdquo; Deadpool has the opportunity to directly address the player, where he tells them to press a certain button to do certain commands. When presented with the right combination of platforms, he wearily suggests new moves, such as the novel idea of &lsquo;wall jumping&rsquo;. Deadpool also demonstrates some exaggerated acts of violence, for example yelling &ldquo;No guts no glory&rdquo; when hanging from his entrails, or shouting &ldquo;Oh that's gonna leave a mark&rdquo; when dismembering an enemy.<br/><br/>Combat gameplay relies heavily on using the character&rsquo;s trademark arsenal of swords and guns, as well as giving players the option to equip more irregular weapons such as sledgehammers. By default Deadpool is armed with both guns and swords, but he also has access to giant hammers, laser guns, and a range of other alternatives. Some attacks result in dismemberment or decapitations; body parts and bloodstains can be seen on the ground. There&rsquo;s a short range teleportation move as well. Since Deadpool possesses an accelerated healing factor, he slowly falls apart as he sustains damage, and players will be presented with the choice either to reattach severed limbs or wait for them to regrow. The game also employs stealth attacks, in which close-up camera angles depict more severe damage against enemies.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Deadpool (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "144572": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6833": {"name": "Wojciech Zalewski"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Compass 1940", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"24441": "B-35"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1716583_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6912": {"name": "Taktyka i Strategia"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1716583.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"213017": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Operation Compass was a British counter offensive against the Italians in December 1940.

It is the second game in the series, following the well received None But Heroes about the Battle of Antietam.<br/><br/>The story of Gettysburg is well known or, I should say, the popular rendition of the battle is well known and has certainly been simulated multiple times.<br/><br/>As is usually the case with stripped down, accepted versions of complex events, this narrative misses much flavor and a deeper understanding of what went on. It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;auto-tour&rsquo; version of a much more involved event.<br/><br/>Many things are simply not brought out, or put into proper context, in the affirmed version of the battle:<br/><br/>1)     Lee arrived on the field and tried to get his footing when Ewell (on his own initiative) ordered Rodes and Early to attack. Lee wasted no time in ordering Hill to attack with Heth and Pender to support Ewell&rsquo;s Corps. In the commonly held view, Lee arrived and simply dithered while events unfolded outside his control.<br/><br/>2)    There were several opportunities that afternoon and evening to advance and take Cemetery and/or Culp&rsquo;s Hills. These were missed&hellip; but not, as commonly assumed, because one or more leaders were staring at their navels confused or indecisive. What happened and why?<br/><br/>3)    Ewell made a clear headed decision his men were in no condition to take the hill that evening. He was the commander on the spot. Since then historians and armchair generals everywhere have questioned that decision, the game allows you to see who was right. Ewell was of the opinion that he could only do it if 3rd Corps supported him. That support was ordered by Lee (using 3rd Corps&rsquo; artillery) but was not implemented by the army&rsquo;s chief of artillery. Would that have allowed the attack to work? What was the relative condition of the Union defenders and the potential attacking troops anyway?<br/><br/>4)    There never was any sort of &lsquo;dawn attack&rsquo; order, but there were orders to attack much earlier on the second day than actually occurred. The game allows you to find out what went wrong (so you can draw your own conclusions as to who to blame).<br/><br/>5)    By evening of the 2nd day, the fate of Cemetery Ridge rested in the hands of a handful of formed Union regiments (including the human sacrifice of the 1st Minnisota). Confederate victory was very, very close&mdash;teetering in the balance much more than normally assumed. There was a reason Lee said that if Dorsey Pender remained in command for another 30 minutes, the Confederates would have won the battle. See just how tough the Union job was and how close to the edge they got. What would have been the result of that 2nd day&rsquo;s attack had it launched just a few hours earlier or even at the same time, but with the coordinated use of Anderson&rsquo;s and Pender&rsquo;s divisions?<br/><br/>6)    Everyone assumes Pickett&rsquo;s Charge was a forlorn, desperate, throw of the dice, but what was the condition of many of the Union units manning that ridge? Was this attack a complete reworking of the Confederate battle plan out of blind frustration or was it a continuation of the plan from both earlier days? What was the earlier, theoretically coordinated, plan the attack was ad libbed from?<br/><br/>7)    As a whole, the popular version of the battle pretty much assumes a Union victory unless multiple stars aligned for the Confederates. If this is so, did the Army of the Potomac have to merely put out a &lsquo;fair-to-middl&rsquo;in&rsquo; effort or did they have to fight tooth and nail to gain victory? If the latter, just how close of a run was it? Doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;assuming they will win&rdquo; take away well earned credit they had for finally overcoming a determined and usually successful foe?<br/><br/>Last Chance for Victory attempts to allow players to find their own answers to these questions and points as well as many others. The added depth and nuance makes for a very different and, in my opinion, more accurate rendition of the battle than you&rsquo;ve ever seen before.<br/><br/>Aside from showing the history in a way that will be both entertaining but make you thirst for more and better reading on the topic, multiple variations are provided to explore the battle. Sure, there are the usual &ldquo;extra troops&rdquo; variants, but more importantly, options that allow players to tweak the various historical behavior &lsquo;knobs&rsquo; I assigned. If you think my &lsquo;setting&rsquo; for Howard (to pull a name out of a hat) are all wet, you can change him to be better (or worse) so you can see how your version &lsquo;plays.&rsquo; Likewise, a number of rules simulate activities that were pretty much out of the player&rsquo;s hands (such as Buford&rsquo;s need to screen the town yet keep his losses very low), these can be &lsquo;turned off&rsquo; as desired to see what effect they really have on the battle. There is a matrix of the various &lsquo;control&rsquo; rules and the possible &lsquo;settings&rsquo; for each one that players can use before starting if they disagree with my decisions. The results of your choices might surprise you and spur your understanding of the battle to new levels.<br/><br/>As with None But Heroes, Last Chance for Victory is designed to bring all of this and much more to your table in the most historically accurate and informational jam-packed game possible. Like any LoB game, it was designed with twin goals: the most insight possible and a game with maximum playability.<br/><br/>Enhancing the already well received and streamlined Line of Battle rules, Last Chance for Victory comes with the v2.0 series rules. These rules incorporate the refinements and suggestions of hundreds of real players which make this smooth system even faster to play. Make no mistake, this is the only regimental level Gettysburg game that can be played to completion at a respectable clip&mdash;yet it is a large game. A pair of reasonably fast players could play the campaign game to completion at a convention like ConsimExpo. I&rsquo;ve completed campaign games with three players in a week of rather relaxed play time.<br/><br/>Scenarios abound of various sizes. The campaign uses a 4-map &lsquo;box&rsquo; layout, but the game comes with two additional maps, one covering just the 1st Day&rsquo;s fighting and the other the 2nd and 3rd Day&rsquo;s. The big game scenarios can be played on one or both of those maps and, with those two linked together, it is possible to play the entire battle on 2 maps.<br/><br/>It replaces This Hallowed Ground from the RSS-series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"213025": "English first edition"}, "average": "8.82555", "name": "Last Chance for Victory", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "15", "usersrated": "92", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22819": "Line of Battle Series"}}, "144575": {"boardgamedesigner": {"70198": {"name": "David Officer"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Bots to Bits", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1755369_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"22057": "Jean-Pierre Giguere"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2456": {"name": "The Game Crafter, LLC"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1755369.png", "boardgameversion": {"213032": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "age": "9", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Players take turns shooting or blocking missiles that target face down robot cards and factories.

And the shadow of a conflict unprecedented opens in 1914, died on the field of the Marne and the Somme ... The tomb of civilization.<br/><br/>Crime is a game of investigation . The majority of the player characters are either the police or revolves around it. To set the tone, a history of crimes begins with a beautiful sunny summer morning at the foot of the Eiffel Tower brand new, it often ends with a cold and foggy night in the muddy bottom areas of Paris, at the corner of a dark alley, with the only light in a dull glow red and grimacing moon on the blunt edge of a knife sticky blood...<br/><br/>Horror game to continue. The line between reality and fantasy is thin. So fragile that it readily navigates from one to the other. The monsters that inhabit this world are fallen beings, men who have lost all forms of humanity, either because they have lost their soul, or because their passions were eaten to the point that they lose touch with reality. This fantastic is eminently Gothic, although doubts remain and that rational explanations can remain. This forfeiture is an axiom in the game, a temptation to evil or lack of self-control.

He must learn to manage their anxiety to avoid sudden fit of madness, determined in relation to his temperament. Finding the balance, that is the issue, an army of disciples of Freud are not enough to halt the decline of an investigator who can not resist the lure of the forfeiture. The gameplay is fast and does not hinder the immersion into the world of Crime. Each jet has risks: critical failures, psychological impact, but remains a key to the success of the venture and the progress of the character.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this curious mixture of From Hell crossed with Dracula has many different readings: naturalistic novels of the nineteenth, thrillers such as Melmoth , Hammer films or expressionist works as Caligari .

It was the United States Army's greatest and fiercest battle of World War II. Over a million men and thousands of guns, tanks, and other fighting vehicles were engaged. In those &quot;Bitter Woods,&quot; fighting against heavy odds, the American soldier slowed and then stopped the spearhead of two elite Panzer Armies, forever emblazing themselves in the annals of military history.<br/><br/>Compass Games presents the Designer Edition of this Charles S. Roberts and ORIGINS award nominee. New to this edition are updated unit counter graphics, additional scenarios, and an extended campaign game to allow the Allied counterattack to be fully realized. In addition to the 6 and 8 turn tournament games, Patton's famous relief of Bastogne can be recreated via scenario play. Specific rules include: Mechanized Exploitation Movement, Hidden Fuel Dumps, Leader Units, Reserves, Random Events, Bridge Demolition, Kampfgruppe Peiper Breakout, Skorzeny Infiltration, Air Power, and Artillery Support.<br/><br/>Designer Edition Bitter Woods is the premier edition of this highly acclaimed regimental level Battle of the Bulge game and includes all aspects of the original game plus the expansion edition.

Although the GBA games feature 2D sprites, they were also the first portable Mortal Kombat games to feature 3D style gameplay.<br/><br/>The original character roster of Deadly Alliance was split for the two GBA titles: Shang Tsung, Quan Chi and Scorpion were included in both versions. Frost, Jax, Sub-Zero, Kano, Kung Lao, Kenshi, Kitana, Li Mei, and Sonya are included only in the first Deadly Alliance port. Bo' Rai Cho, Cyrax, Drahmin, Hsu Hao, Johnny Cage, Mavado, Nitara, Raiden and Reptile are included only in Tournament Edition. Blaze, Mokap and Moloch are excluded in both versions.<br/><br/>Tournament Edition builds on the story of Deadly Alliance by including three extra characters that were not in the original versions. These were Sektor, Noob Saibot and Sareena. Sektor and Noob Saibot are palette-swaps of Cyrax and Scorpion respectively, while Sareena returns from the action-adventure game Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero. Tournament Edition is the only Mortal Kombat that does not feature Sub-Zero in any form. Noob Saibot, the original Sub-Zero, is playable, although his identity was not revealed to players until Mortal Kombat: Deception.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "144626": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roolipelaaja (Issue 6 - Dec 2006)", "rpgproducer": {"37443": "Henri Hakkarainen"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1710733.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"3375": "Roolipelaaja"}, "rpg": {"6267": "Heimot"}, "rpgissueversion": {"213174": "Paper cover version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1710733_t.jpg", "description": "No theme for this issue, summing up the first year of Roolipelaaja magazine.<br/><br/>"}, "144627": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6833": {"name": "Wojciech Zalewski"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Narvik 1940", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1997", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1709801_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5251": {"name": "Dragon"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1709801.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"213175": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "&quot;Narvik 1940&quot; simulates the battle fought in april/may 1940 between German forces that inavded Norway and Norwegian army supported by ally expeditionary corps, formed with polish, english and french units.<br/><br/>Game was attachted to the 3rd issue of &quot;Dragon Strateg&quot; magazine and published in 1997.<br/><br/>&quot;Narvik 1940&quot; uses &quot;Bitwy Drugiej Wojny \u015awiatowej&quot; system rules.<br/><br/>"}, "144628": {"rpg": {"1869": "Lady Blackbird"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Lady Blackbird", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1705658.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"213177": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"184": "History"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1705658_t.jpg", "description": "From John Harper's Website:<br/><br/>A re-skinning of Lady Blackbird for the age of tall ships and piracy in the Caribbean.<br/><br/>"}, "144629": {"rpgitemversion": {"213178": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Post-Apocbird", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1705609.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1869": "Lady Blackbird"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpggenre": {"165": "Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1705609_t.jpg", "description": "From John Harper's Website:<br/><br/>A collection of characters for a Twilight 2000 style post-apocalypse game.<br/><br/>"}, "144630": {"rpgitemversion": {"213179": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Alien Survivor", "rpgproducer": {"9832": "Will Hindmarch"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1705661.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1869": "Lady Blackbird"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1705661_t.jpg", "description": "From John Harper's Website: A survival-horror sci-fi adventure, using the LB system as the core.<br/><br/>"}, "144631": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1746389.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"141": {"name": "Friedemann Friese"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"4959": "Harald Lieske"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"58": {"name": "2F-Spiele"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1746389_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "description": "Futterneid, the final game in Friedemann Friese's Friday Project, is all about the snacks lying on a table at a game night.

To win, player needs to collect 61 points.<br/><br/>Bohemian Schneider is similar to a German game Elfern, or Figurenspiel, in which the cards don't have the usual point values, but instead the honour cards are all worth one point and the goal is to collect 11 of the 20 honours, hence the name (Elfern means &quot;making elevens&quot;).<br/><br/>(Source: <i>The Penguin Book of Card Games</i> by David Parlett)<br/><br/>"}, "144644": {"rpgitemversion": {"213210": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "21 Organizations", "rpgproducer": {"66306": "Curtis Rickman"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1706053.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": {"103210": "Critics' Corner"}, "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "rpg": {"499": "Traveller (Mongoose)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"21432": "21 Series"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1706053_t.png", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>21 Organizations provides 21 new and varied groups to use in a Traveller campaign.

War Command blends traditional elements of collectible card games with the gameplay of a tabletop strategy game. The game plays out similar to chess, with each player maneuvering their six character cards to attempt to attack and kill the enemy commander character. <br/>Players can use three actions each turn to move characters, attack with characters, or play support cards from their hand, like a spell or upgrade card. When attacking or being attacked, players can also play attack or defense cards which only affect that instance.<br/>Gameplay and Deckbuilding are both quick and easy to learn, but deep and open for exploration. The game storyline revolves around three races (the reptilian G'harrana, the technologically advanced Delylians, and the war-hardened Humans) who have fled to the same remote planet to avoid a wave of radiation that is wiping out all life in the galaxy. Their fragile civilizations, crumbling from the expense of the migration effort, are unable to maintain communications due to the planetwide frequency of magnetic storms. The units on the ground are soon isolated, and must make new allies to stay alive. This is reflected in game in that you can mix races in your decks ;)<br/>The storyline is brought to life on each and every card through the spectacular artwork of established artists like Keith Thompson and Shaun Mitchell, as well as younger talents like Austen Mengler, Ven Locklear, and more!<br/><br/>"}, "144663": {"rpgitemversion": {"213231": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Robots", "rpgproducer": {"69178": "Melanie Blake"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1706076.png", "usersrated": "2", "average": "7", "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "rpg": {"499": "Traveller (Mongoose)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1706076_t.png", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Someone yelled &bdquo;That armor&rsquo;s too strong!

Rumors about total annihilation have spread through every corner of each galaxy. The rumor is that if one particular object can be obtained, then that alien's race and home planet will be saved. Otherwise, their race will be exterminated and their home planet will be destroyed. One alien whispers to another, &quot;What are we looking for?&quot; The other alien snaps back, &quot;The Grail, of course.&quot;<br/><br/>Extraterrestrial Grail is a turn-based strategy board game for 2-4 players. Extraterrestrial Grail takes place in outer space in which you are an alien searching for the Grail. Only one player gets the Grail at the beginning of the game, so the other aliens must find out where it is by fighting each other and exploring planets for it.<br/><br/>Each player receives attribute cards at the beginning of the game. A player can only hold a maximum of 6 attribute cards in their hand at a time. All of the attribute cards that the player has chosen to not place in their hand must go into their planet boxes. Some attribute cards are weapons which remove life points from an enemy alien (bomb, missile, laser rifle, and etc.). Other attribute cards are designed to steal cards from other aliens (mug gloves, rope, and etc.). There are also attribute cards that let you safely search and give you the ability to search foreign planets (respiration headgear, flashlight, thermal garment, and etc.). There are many more kinds of attribute cards as well!<br/><br/>Turn Options:<br/><br/>     Roll die and move your alien (only once per turn)<br/>     Search a planet for attribute cards (if your alien token is on a planet)<br/>     Start a battle with an enemy alien located on the same space as your alien<br/>     Use attribute card(s) in your hand<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Battle Turn Options (choose one per battle turn):<br/><br/>     Use natural attack<br/>     Flee from battle<br/>     Use an attribute card in your hand<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The object of the game is to have the Grail in your hand when the alarm goes off or have the Grail in your hand when all the other aliens have been eliminated. If no one has the Grail in their hand when the timer alarm goes off, then everyone loses. For example: If there is time still left on the timer and only one alien is still alive, then that alien must find the Grail before time is up to win the game (the game will end when the last player standing finds the Grail).<br/><br/>"}, "144733": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1772936.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"206944": {"name": "Russian Railroads: American Railroads"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2748": {"name": "Helmut Ohley"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"11968": "Martin Hoffmann"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"133": {"name": "Hans im Gl\u00fcck Verlags-GmbH"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1772936_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1088": {"name": "Industry / Manufacturing"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"25317": "2013 Meeples' Choice Nominee"}, "description": "In Russian Railroads, players compete in an exciting race to build the largest and most advanced railway network. In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.<br/><br/>The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.<br/><br/>There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:<br/>- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.<br/>- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.<br/>- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.<br/><br/>The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:<br/>- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces<br/>- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.<br/>- earn 2 coins<br/>- take 2 temporary workers<br/>- jump ahead in turn order<br/>- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you<br/><br/>Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.<br/><br/>After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"257033": "Czech/Polish First edition"}, "average": "7.82089", "name": "Russian Railroads", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2082": "Worker Placement"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "9353", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}}, "144734": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2971623.png", "is_expanded_by": {"230098": {"name": "Arcane Academy: Bow of Spell Mastery"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1533": {"name": "Eric M.

For, if he's noticed, the (also randomly selected) detective may have enough clues to lead to a proper accusation.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>First, establish the play area. Usually this is played in a house, but it can be played anywhere that is dark enough.  You will want to establish areas that are off limits if any.<br/><br/>Prepare a deck of cards, one per player.  The player who secretly, and randomly, selects the ace of spades is the murderer.  The one that selects the King is the detective. All others are civilians.<br/><br/>Once these cards are secretly looked at, and replaced, a countdown is done, and the lights are turned out.<br/><br/>At this point all players may wonder about freely. Some may hide, some may go out looking for evidence.  As the murderer, you may walk up to someone and say &quot;You're dead&quot;.  Once they've heard this they're dead, but they may also scream before they've been killed.  A &quot;dead body&quot; can be lead wherever the murderer would like to place them, and they must stay there until the end of this phase.<br/><br/>One may also, regardless of the role, touch someone and ask &quot;are you dead?&quot;.  This is the only time a dead person may speak, &quot;yes&quot; they would say.  At this point &quot;body body body!&quot; is yelled.  Someone turns on the lights, and now we try to discover who the murderer was.<br/><br/>All gather in a common area. Those who are dead indicate as such, and where they were found is established.  It is best for the dead to sit away from the main area.  It is VERY IMPORTANT that the dead not speak at all, or give any indication who killed them.<br/><br/>If the detective has been killed, then the murderer has won.  Otherwise, the detective will start asking questions of the living.  Some play that the detective may only ask &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questions.  The murderer may lie about anything, and also make false accusations.

New Zealand and Australia were the first to issue the challenge, but soon after Scotland, South Africa, and the United States joined in. Then Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, and even Brazil intervened. England proudly refused to be forced into this dispute and proposed a worldwide racing championship be held in the Suffolk countryside in order to establish who were the world's supreme sheep farmers. Thus, the sheep race became an incredible and fascinating reality...<br/><br/>In The Sheep Race, players must place bets on three races, with six sheep participating in each race. Each sheep starts with a number of &quot;breath&quot; cubes (in three colors) on it, along with numbers for three speeds of movement: trot, walk, and gallop.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he rolls the two dice &ndash; one a normal d6 and the other having values 0-0-0-1-2-3 &ndash; then moves the sheep in the appropriate lane, with a 7 or 8 moving the sheep in the outer two lanes and a 9 moving the lazy sheep at the back of the pack. When you move a sheep, you choose one of the three types of movement, advance the sheep the indicated number of spaces, and remove the appropriate breath cubes required &ndash; or you make the sheep rest so that it recovers two blue breath cubes.<br/><br/>If a sheep hits the &quot;end zone&quot; &ndash; the final five spaces of a lane &ndash; with no cubes on it, then the sheep is exhausted and can't move or rest again. The race ends when three sheep reach the finish line or when all the sheep are exhausted. The first three positions pay off for those who bet on them, even if one or more of those positions contains an exhausted sheep.<br/><br/>Players place three bets in the first two races (two secret and one visible) and two bets in the final race (both secret). Whoever collects the most in bets wins!<br/><br/>With the advanced rules, players choose which sheep to move each time and the game lasts only one race, with players betting on the final order of all the sheep. Sheep sometimes get blocked and can move again only when passed by the flock leader.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"213496": "Multilingual first edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "The Sheep Race", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "average": "6.54655", "usersrated": "174", "boardgamefamily": {"7481": "Animals: Sheep"}}, "144790": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1714296.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"50881": {"name": "Darrell Louder"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"49982": "Christopher Kirkman"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"17424": {"name": "Greater Than Games (Dice Hate Me Games)"}}, "maxplaytime": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1714296_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "description": "Angry Dice is a real-time dice rolling microgame.

Whether you enjoy creating multiple decks, each with their own playing style or just having your primary deck that dominates your opponents - Armored will engage you.  From the beginning steps of creating your deck and identifying your playing style to the actual battle, all your favorite card game experiences are still there.<br/><br/>On each card, one asset is shown along with the accurate information for that vehicle, weapon system, troop or other asset such as stats and associated military symbology. Much like other card games, Armored is played with 'Attack' and 'Defense' stats. Specific to military requirements of movement and weapons, 'Range' and 'Weight' have been added.<br/><br/>Armored can be played with 2 or more players on a tabletop or map. Each player has a minimum of three rows that are active within the game. It is within these rows that assets are introduced and maneuvered onto the playing field. Columns have been included to create a grid structure required as assets advance, retreat and evade their opponent.

In addition to the previous shows, such as the ones set in the Universal Century like Zeta and Char's Counterattack, the game also features the alternate timeline series, such as Wing, 00, Turn-A and, the newest addition, Gundam Age.<br/><br/>Similar to Gundam War, combat in Gundam War Nex-A is still divided into two zones, Earth and Space, with the players able to designate different Units into squads. Players attack one another in turn, attempting to deplete each others' Nation Pile(Draw deck), in order to win. Character or Operation cards can be placed on existing Units, giving the assigned Mobile Suit or Armor a bonus in its stats or additional effects. Command cards also give one time effects which players may trigger during their appropriate phases. Ace cards, the rarest card type typically found in boosters, combine Units and Characters into one cost efficient card.<br/><br/>Unlike Gundam War however, Gundam War Nex-A no longer has Generation(Resource) cards. Instead, each card can be played as a resource. Further, Roll-ing(Tapping/activating) a card may now include a cost in resources. Alternatively, players have the option of using Graphic card, which combines resource generation, buffing and defense into one card.<br/><br/>Though the card backs of Gundam War Nex-A are different from Gundam War, Gundam War cards can still be converted for use in Gundam War Nex-A, though with a penalty or drawback of sorts.<br/><br/>Gundam War Nex-A is only available in Japanese.<br/><br/>"}, "144926": {"rpgitemversion": {"213732": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mecha: Mercenaries", "rpgproducer": {"23474": "Angus Abranson"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2387368.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"6365": "Mecha"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"3712": "Mecha"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2387368_t.png", "description": "from the back of the book<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t Fight for Loyalty<br/><br/>Loyalty is overrated.

The game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic, tactical card battles, with the armies in this set particularly focused towards cavalry and ranged combat.<br/><br/>During Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn. Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.<br/><br/>The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Elves and the Lizardmen. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Elf faction is based around strong cavalry units and archers, but has a relatively weak infantry. The Lizardmen army is the most flexible Lords of War army released so far and is best used to disrupt and counter enemy attack strategies.<br/><br/>Elves versus Lizardmen is compatible with Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict ranking system, to create mercenary decks for tournament play.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"301435": "Czech first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "average": "7.1009", "name": "Lords of War:  Elves versus Lizardmen", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "177", "boardgamefamily": {"24131": "Lords of War"}}, "144989": {"rpgitemversion": {"213845": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dystopia Rising Tabletop Corebook", "rpghonor": {"28118": "2014 Indie Game of the Year Runner-Up"}, "rpgproducer": {"15266": "Joshua Jaffe"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1713762.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"22849": "Dystopia Rising"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"28957": "Horror (Zombies)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1713762_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Dystopia Rising explores the grim realities of our potential future.
