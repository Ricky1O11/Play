The events take place on an open world battlefield divided between two factions, each trying to capture bases from the opposite side until the enemy has been wiped out from the area. The player takes the role of a private and fights along his/her comrades controlled by AI, slowly gaining influence over fellow soldiers through rank promotions from success in battles.<br/><br/>When the influence grows, AI soldiers begin to follow the player starting as a combat pair, ultimately forming a 10-member squad. The AI squad commanding has been made as transparent as possible to avoid micromanagement and excess amount of keys or menus. The AI squad members e.g. find cover on leader&rsquo;s signal from crouching, they spot enemies on their own and open fire if it fits the situation. When the leader uses a suppressed weapon for stealth approach, the squad will engage in fight only if the enemy manages to alert the surroundings by shouting or shooting.<br/><br/>The soldiers die quickly, and the player&rsquo;s soldier makes no exception. The game uses the simplest possible die-or-don&rsquo;t bullet hit model, which makes the gameplay extremely intense and challenging. Caution, frequent usage of covers, suppressing fire to buy time and staying with the group is highly encouraged; the heroic rambo-style risk taking will likely lead only to a quick death.. it&rsquo;s a beautiful way to go though.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "124047": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1364948.png", "boardgameimplementation": {"89695": "RoboDerby: Express"}, "is_expanded_by": {"197943": {"name": "Pirate Dice: 5th Player Expansion"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"7295": {"name": "Sean Brown"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"60351": "Raymond Tan"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"597": {"name": "Eagle-Gryphon Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1364948_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "description": "Ready for a taste of high adventure on the rolling seas?

Players act as farmers and operate a cart in which they will harvest produce and deliver them to the five villages to sell. Additionally, players will compete for Produce Order cards, which reward Lira points for selling desirable produce in specific villages. Players track sold produce in each village using their Fulfillment Cards. The winner is the player who gains the most Lire by selling valuable produce, gaining popularity in the villages, and fulfilling Produce Orders.<br/><br/><br/>Game Set Up and Play<br/><br/>During setup in Cinque Terre, colored dice are randomly pulled from a cloth bag and rolled to establish the prices each village will pay for select produce. Each player also begins play with a private order only she can fulfill. Five public orders are turned up that all players can work on, though only the first player to fulfill each public order will score points for it. The Most Popular Vendor cards (1 for each village) are placed face up along one side of the board. The first player to fill an entire row with produce cubes for a particular village earns the Most Popular Vendor card for that village, which provides bonus points. Four Produce cards are turned face up and each player receives 4 to begin with along with a Fulfillment board and Produce Truck in their color.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can perform 3 actions in any order or combination you choose:<br/><br/><br/>     Take a Produce Card - either a faceup card or one from the deck.<br/>     Move your Produce Cart up four spaces clockwise around the board.<br/>     Harvest produce from the location your cart is currently at. Each produce cube you wish to harvest requires a matching card. Two identical cards can be used in place of any one other card. Your cart can hold up to 4 produce cubes at a time.<br/>     Deliver produce to a village. Unload the produce cubes you wish to deliver and place them in the appropriate spaces for that village on your fulfillment card.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of your turn, if you complete a public order or achieve Most Popular Vendor, take the appropriate card, scoring the points indicated. You can only complete one public order per turn. When you complete a public order, you must draw a new card from the Order Deck. If you would like to keep that card as a private order, add it to your hand and draw another and place it face up to replace the public order just completed. If you do not wish to keep the card you drew as a private order, place it face up instead. Any private orders not fultilled by game end count as negative points against you.<br/><br/>Players take turns taking their 3 actions until one player has completed 5 public orders (Most Popular Vendor Cards also count as public orders for determining game end), then everyone gets one more turn, including the player who caused the game to end.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"164125": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.06756", "name": "Cinque Terre", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "13", "usersrated": "992", "boardgameaccessory": {"178091": "Cinque Terre Truck Upgrade Kit"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"11515": "Country: Italy"}}, "124056": {"rpgitemversion": {"164129": "Softcover Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Mal\u00e9fices: IIIe \u00e9dition:  Le livre", "rpgproducer": {"60022": "Olivier Babarit"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpg": {"18150": "Mal\u00e9fices (3eme \u00e9dition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "rpggenre": {"954": "Crime (Conspiracy)"}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Mal&eacute;fices 3rd edition rulebook.<br/><br/>Malefices is a French horror RPG.<br/><br/>It contains a set of rules (60 pages)<br/>-the background (150 pages)<br/>-two scenarii (60 pages)<br/><br/>The setting is France at the end of the 19th centure and beginning of the 20th.

The admiral sails in one of the ships in the main harbour. The object of the game is to sink the enemy ship carrying the hostile admiral. One very interesting feature is that the ships in the smaller havens cannot be moved until they are released by the other ships in their navy.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player has three options. He may move one galleon one or two spaces in any direction; he may engage in battle with an enemy ship standing on an adjacent space, or he may move his admiral from one of his ships to an adjacent one. You release a ship simply by moving one of your galleons to the space immediately in front of the harbour in which it rests. Once having left port, no ship may return there during the game. This ensures that all ships are kept on active service and there is no running for cover. Battles are resolved by the roll of dice, one die for each friendly ship (up to a maximum of three) adjacent to the victim. Each 5 or 6 thrown results in a hit. A hit on a galleon in full sail means that the tile must be turned to reveal the damaged vessel. A hit on a damaged ship results in the sinking of that ship.<br/><br/>Obviously the main tactic is to release all of your ships as quickly as possible, and try to attack on a 2 &mdash; 1 basis. Due to the choice of options, a player must move his ship next to the enemy on one turn and wait until the next before firing his guns.

Reference to the diagram will show that the board has four black squares, known as Vantage Points, and two Castles.<br/><br/>Each of the two players begins with twelve playing pieces of three types.- Lumps, Blobs and Things. Each piece also bears a number from 1 to 6 and a pair of pieces with the same number constitute a unit. A player's four Lumps consist of two units numbered 1 and 2, his four Blobs are units 3 and 4, whilst the four Things are 5 and 6.<br/><br/>The board is placed with a Castle in front of each player, who then places his pieces anywhere in the three rows nearest to him, one piece per square. On a turn, a player must move one of his units. Pieces may not move onto or over an occupied square, except when capturing an opposing piece. The actual moves that can be made are as follows:<br/>(1)    Where both members of a unit are on the board but neither is on a Vantage Point, both pieces are moved one or two squares in any direction, but both must move the same distance and direction. It is this feature that gives the game its name.<br/>(2)    Where both pieces are on the board with either or both on Vantage Points, they can move as above but independently of one another.<br/>(3)    One piece of a unit on the board, not a Vantage Point, moves one space in any direction.<br/>(4)    One piece on a Vantage Point, one or two squares in any direction.<br/><br/>Pieces may only capture certain other pieces as follows:<br/><br/>Lumps (1 and 2) capture Blobs (3 and 4).<br/>Blobs (3 and 4) capture Things (5 and 6).<br/>Things (5 and 6) capture Lumps (1 and 2).<br/><br/>When captured, a piece is removed from the board and may only return under one circumstance; if it is the last piece of any one type, a player may exchange one of his pieces in play for the captured piece, which is immediately swapped with it and placed on the board. The object of the game is to move a piece onto one's opponent's castle, or to capture all of his pieces.

Some want to use the streamlined mechanics of Forsaken to portray werewolves as doomed heroes against the forces of primal corruption. Others feel that the smaller scale of horror present in Forsaken is something they want more support for in their Apocalypse games. Some players want to mix bits of everything, incorporating the Tribes of the Moon, the Fera, the hisil, and powerful Garou warriors into the one chronicle to see what happens.<br/><br/>This translation guide exists to help people play Apocalypse with Forsaken rules, or vice versa.

Turning their attention to the small island of Midway, Yamamoto's primary strategic goal was the elimination of America's carrier forces, which he perceived as the principal threat to the overall Pacific campaign. Armed with less-than-full-strength carriers, Admiral Nagumo sought to destroy the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s counterparts commanded by Admiral Fletcher. The Battle of Midway begins with Japanese aircraft poised to demolish the airfield on Midway Island. The Japanese carrier fleet has just moved within range to retrieve the aircraft after their attack, presuming the U.S. fleet is nearby. Knowing the Japanese fleets are within attack range, the U.S. has launched aircraft from Midway to deliver a counterstrike while maneuvering its fleet to launch an all-out air assault against the enemy flattops.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME<br/>The Battle of Midway is a two-player game with one player controlling the U.S. forces defending Midway Island and the other player controlling the Japanese forces attempting to sink the U.S. fleet and invade the island.<br/><br/>While the U.S. faces grim odds in this battle, they have one major advantage &ndash; they have broken the Japanese radio code. They know the location and makeup of the Japanese forces; while the exact location and makeup of the U.S. fleet is unknown to the Japanese. The Japanese must first find the U.S. fleet before they can attack it, while simultaneously protecting their carriers from the inevitable counter-attack by U.S. aircraft.<br/><br/>For the U.S. to achieve a decisive victory they must sink 4 of the 5 Japanese carriers, matching the success of the real battle. Sinking 3 Japanese carriers or any combination of 4 capital ships (carriers and battleships) will give the U.S. a major victory. The Japanese will achieve a major victory if they sink 2 of the 3 U.S. carriers and destroy the airbase at Midway, forcing the remaining U.S. ships to retreat; and a decisive victory if they sink all 3 U.S. carriers and destroy the airbase at Midway, which paves the way to land the troops and take control of the island and the Pacific theatre. Alternatively, each unit in the game has been given a Victory Point value. The game can be played to 10 or 12 Victory Points (recommended), depending on the length of game you want. If both sides achieve the required points in the same turn, the side with more points wins the battle.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"164218": "First Edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "The Battle of Midway", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "5.66667", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"34": "Axis & Allies"}}, "124097": {"rpg": {"1789": "4e Game System Product (D&D 4.0 Compatible)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Heart of Fire", "rpgproducer": {"52371": "David Flor"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1302866.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"164219": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"1013": "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1302866_t.jpg", "description": "Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition adventure for a party of 10th level characters.<br/><br/>From the back cover<br/><br/>Over a century ago, the nation of Cerra was terrorized by Vulkanon, a fearsome dragon that rose out from an active volcano on a small neighboring island.<br/><br/>To deal with the threat, the council of Cerra hired a group of adventures led by Raylen Darathar&mdash;a powerful elemental mage&mdash;to seek out of the dragon and destroy it.

The board contains a 5 x 5 squared grid, with the squares in two of the opposite corners being of a different colour to the rest, and designated as Castles. Each player has a set of five plastic pieces. These are cup-shaped and placed &lsquo;upside down&rsquo; on the board. Inside one cup of each set is a marker which identifies the piece as a Spy.<br/><br/>The objectives of the game are to manoeuvre one's Spy into the enemy Castle and to discover the whereabouts of the opposing Spy. The achievement of either of these will cause that player to win the game.<br/><br/>At the start, the players set out their pieces on the five squares immediately in front of their own Castle, remembering which piece is the Spy. During his turn a player may move any one of his pieces in any direction as many squares as he wishes. A piece is not allowed to jump over nor occupy the same square as another piece. Instead of moving, a player may choose to interrogate an enemy piece. This is done by moving one of his pieces to rest orthogonally adjacent to the piece to be questioned, and on the next turn asking if it is the Spy. The other player must identify the piece so questioned. If it is the Spy, then the questioner has won the game; however if it is not, then the asking player loses his piece, and if the asking piece was the Spy, then he also loses the game. The rules do not state that it is illegal to occupy one&rsquo;s own Castle, but one must assume that it is, in order to avoid stalemate. Also the rules do not make it clear as to what happens when a player has all his pieces blocked and cannot move on his turn.<br/><br/>Bluffing is an important part of the game. It is not mandatory to interrogate a piece, even having moved into position to do so, neither is it obligatory to remain in position to be questioned. One can thus chase an opposing piece around the board only to discover eventually that it was a decoy, and in the meantime the enemy Spy is well positioned to enter one&rsquo;s own stronghold.<br/><br/>As it is only permissible to enter a Castle orthogonally, it is possible to set up an impregnable defence, by placing a piece on the squares either side of it. This ploy however, will limit the number of pieces that one can move, and unless one employs the Spy as a defender, increases the chances of one&rsquo;s Spy being exposed.<br/><br/>"}, "124106": {"rpgitemversion": {"164242": "Boxed Set"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Champions 3rd Edition Boxed Set", "rpgproducer": {"19875": "Thessaloniki Canotas"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic514717.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": {"2349": "Champions Universe"}, "average": "9", "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpg": {"402": "Champions (3rd Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic514717_t.jpg", "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>BE A HERO!<br/><br/>The earth is in grave peril from the forces of evil -- only your incredible powers and courageous spirit can save the day!

And, of course, all Hero System games fit together to form a unique gaming environment.<br/><br/>This box contains:<br/><br/>- An easy-to-use Rulebook<br/>- An introductory Solo Adventure<br/>- An informative Campaign Book<br/>- Three interlocking Viper's Nest adventures<br/><br/>"}, "124107": {"boardgamedesigner": {"7998": {"name": "Mark Hanny"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Other World", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1308727_t.jpg", "average": "6.7125", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7742": {"name": "Joe Magic Games, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1308727.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"164248": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Other World is a fantasy themed game where each player assumes the role of a medieval character with weapon skill and spell casting skill.  <br/>There are two boards in which each places a pawn; the village and the catacombs.  In the village players gain basic weapons (tokens), magical spells (cards), and enchanted weapons (cards). Players may also petition the king for increased abilities or to commission new weapons to be made.  They may also serve in the king's army to gain influence, gather raw materials, sell materials at market, visit the healer, or hire the sorcerer to create magical items.  All the while a dark prince roams the village causing havoc for the players.  There are twelve creatures infesting the catacombs that can be fought for treasure, enchanted items, or victory points depending on the level in which they reside.  Players use items to manipulate dice in combat.<br/>Each player must move each turn and two players cannot occupy the same space.  The creatures in the catacombs get increasingly difficult as a player moves to lower levels.  The winner of the game is player to gain the most victory points.  The game is played in 60 to 90 minutes and is for 3 to 5 players 12 years and older.<br/><br/>Kickstarter: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/628734072/other-world-0' rel='nofollow'>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/628734072/other-world-0</a><br/><br/>"}, "124108": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "10 Inquisitor Feats", "rpgproducer": {"29416": "Steven D.

He demanded that the people of the world take care of each other, with no promise of reward in the afterlife and no monetary compensation. Anyone who dissented and tried to hold on to their ideological identity was executed. The man wielded a force that no one on Earth could match - the creatures from the Between.<br/><br/>The Between is the place behind shadows, and it connects every shadow on the planet. While the man who destroyed the world isn't the only one capable of accessing the Between (in fact, your character can be an Opener if you'd like!), He does seem to be the only one with the ability to control the monsters therein. He sent these monsters out after anyone still clinging to religion, national identity, politics or economics, and those people were either killed on the spot or dragged into the Between, never to be seen again.<br/><br/>It's been 10 years. Over the ensuing decade, His oversight has grown less stringent, to the point that expressing one's faith or beliefs isn't quite so dangerous anymore. The people living in this world gather together in small, often mobile communities, doing their best to take care of themselves and each other. But some people just aren't interested in helping, and seek to take what they need. Some people tempt fate by trying to bring back religious worship or commerce, or other overt forms of ideology.<br/><br/>And some people still feel, even after so much death and destruction, that it's possible to win back the world.<br/><br/>The System<br/><br/>curse the darkness uses an original game system based around playing cards. Unlike many RPGs, it doesn't have a skill list or a complicated system for resolving combat and other situations. Instead, players undertake two kinds of Challenge: Character and Removal.<br/><br/>A Character Challenge helps define the character, and resolves an action that doesn't carry a risk of death or removal from the story. Character Challenges are based on one of four Attributes, each corresponding to a suit of cards: Focus (Diamonds), Stability (Clubs), Stamina (Spades) and Humanity (Hearts).<br/><br/>A Removal Challenge happens when the characters enter a situation that might lead to one or more of them being taken out of the game. Removal Challenges aren't based on the four Attributes, but on the characters' actions within the context of the situation. Characters in curse the darkness can and do die, much more easily than in many other RPGs.<br/><br/>The death of a character, however, can spur the survivors on to accomplishing their goal. When a character dies or leaves play, the others can gain Memory Points from that loss, and use those to find the inner fire to finish the scenario. Of course, the players also each have the option to refuse to fight, to be simply swept along by events.<br/><br/>Everything in the game, then, comes down to this essential choice: light a candle, or curse the darkness?<br/><br/>"}, "124129": {"boardgamedesigner": {"49750": {"name": "Frank Capotorto"}}, "average": "5.5", "poll": {}, "name": "To Cry a Joust", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1837957_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"71930": "R.F.

Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.<br/><br/>Each turn players add &quot;wake&quot; tiles to the 7&times;7 game board; each tile has two &quot;wake connections&quot; on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.<br/><br/>What's new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.<br/><br/>If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game. Another way to be ousted! The more daikaiju tiles on the game board, the faster players will find themselves trying to breathe water...<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"164387": "Multilingual first edition"}, "average": "6.62237", "name": "Tsuro of the Seas", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "3757", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "124176": {"poll": {}, "name": "Race of the Turtles and Hares", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1950", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic843819_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"451": {"name": "National Games, Inc."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic843819.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"164391": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1031": {"name": "Racing"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "For two players<br/><br/>Object: to get all checkers from one aide of the board in the illustrated squares to the opposite side.<br/><br/>Place 22 red and 22 black checkers on the squares with illustrations on them.

The tenth installment of the Castlevania video game series and a 2D side-scroller, it acts as a middleground between the earlier, typically linear Castlevania games and the later open-exploration ones; Rondo of Blood makes use of untimed stages with a clear beginning, but occasionally more than one ending.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The objective is to guide the primary player character Richter Belmont through nine stages, with four alternate routes, as he searches for his kidnapped beloved Annette and ultimately confronts Dracula in his castle. Richter makes use of a whip as his main weapon and one of six sub-weapons: an axe, a dagger, holy water, a grimoire, a pocket watch, and a cross. While exploring the castle, Richter can rescue four maidens, including Annette's young sister Maria Renard who then becomes a playable character. She attacks using her doves and one of six sub-weapons: a cat, dragon, cardinal, turtle, egg or musical notes.<br/><br/>Rondo of Blood incorporates elements from the earlier Castlevania games which typically featured linear gameplay and a member of the Belmont clan as the protagonist, and the later entries which emphasized untimed exploration of the environment. Rondo of Blood makes use of untimed stages with a clear beginning, but more than one ending to some levels; this then affects the subsequent environment, monsters, and boss monster that the player character encounters at the end of the level. Items such as money, hearts, and food can be found scattered throughout the areas. Rondo of Blood also features the Item Crash ability reused in subsequent Castlevania titles, which allows a sub-weapon to be used in a super attack. Its direct sequel, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, reuses many of the monsters.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Castlevania: Rondo of Blood&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "124195": {"boardgamedesigner": {"60114": {"name": "Zeke Abuhoff"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Tide of Battle", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2003": "Rock-Paper-Scissors"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"5786": "Sports: Combat Sports / Martial Arts"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1302022_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"26332": {"name": "Greater Gotham"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1302022.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"164448": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Tide of Battle is a customizable card game for 2 or 4 players.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of martial artists in combat with each other.

During this operation, the british dropped by parachute must capture the radar, one or two german operators, destroy the manor and finally embark all in the waiting Landing Craft Assaults.<br/><br/>The game is edited under ziplock and contains a A3-size map depicting Bruneval surroundings at night (scale at 1/25000), 108 counters (the 3 formation of British paratroopers Drake, Nelson and Rodney ; german coastal defense, luftwaffe guards, MGs, pill-boxes and part of 685th infantry regiment reinforcements ; activation and other markers). One typical counter unit represents around 10 men. The rules are included in a separate 15 pages A5-sized booklet.<br/><br/>The duration of the game is 13 turns from 0:15 et 03:15 am. The player plays the British side first each turn and then the activated german units fight, move and get reinforcements in this respective order. Except for the coastal defenses, the german units are not represented on the map at the beginning. Instead, several randomly selected activation markers are deployed in specific areas of the map. The combination of proximity to British units and alert level may trigger an activation marker that may hide from 0 to 4 german units. These activated units may then fight and move. German move is dictated by closest (in PM) and largest enemy stack or German stack. Combat is resolved by comparing the strength of both adjacent stacks modified by the presence of an officer, the terrain modifier and 1D6. Largest score inflicts one step loss to the other.<br/>The British must score at least 10 victory points to get a marginal victory. More than 20 is a decisive victory.

Starfire has two parts: tactical combat and a strategic campaign system.<br/><br/>The tactical combat is a fast paced, fleet-level starship combat system with both a tactical level and an operational level. The tactical level is where starships engage in ship-to-ship combat around planets and warp points. The operational level is where you maneuver your fleet of starships across a star system to find where your enemy is hiding. Starship designs are simple, easy to create, and the combat system is quick enough to let players destroy dozens of starships in an evening.<br/><br/>The campaign system allows a player to start an empire and control all aspects of expansion: research, construction, colonization, exploration, etc. in an attempt to build an empire. Designed with procedurally generated system generation and a non-player race generation, each campaign is literally unique. The campaign system has been made to be easily modified for custom games and the rules have a hundred additional pages of source materials to help create those custom games.<br/><br/>Originally started as an upgrade of the Ultra Starfire rules, Solar Starfire is based on Ultra Starfire and has become a living work with new goals and purpose. The rules are being built by a new team of developers that have plans to continuously adapt and upgrade the game with new material, new release methods, and most of all - the new storyline. Solar Starfire was built specifically for the history of the Terran Solar Union and will continue to be expanded as the story line opens up new possibilities.<br/><br/>Still using the unique tactical combat system designed in 1976, Solar Starfire is the same core gaming system as Starfire has always been. The new team is building free starter materials for new players to learn and demo the Starfire system, while the website maintains a community forum and a FREE downloads section with player-created materials and previously-available gaming materials for most editions of Starfire.<br/><br/>"}, "124222": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Ars Mag (Issue 23 - Jul 2001)", "rpgproducer": {"17391": "Eric Kouris"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgissue": {"18027": "Ars Mag"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"85510": "\u00c0 l'horizon"}, "rpgissueversion": {"164506": "Softcover Version"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Pour info<br/>&Eacute;dito<br/>Sommaire<br/>Les ampoules de Saint Janvier<br/>Rencontre avec John Kasab<br/>Quand il fermera, nul n'ouvrira<br/>Les lapidaires<br/>Concours de sc&eacute;narios<br/>Les mages lapidaires<br/>Le cr&eacute;puscule des mages : Episode 2<br/>Bulletin d'abonnement<br/>Histoire de Guorna la F&eacute;tide, Tremere et Tytalus<br/>&Agrave; l'horizon<br/>Portrait de famille<br/><br/>"}, "124223": {"boardgamedesigner": {"60153": {"name": "B.

The task of the players is to try and locate the exact position of this hidden treasure. It can be achieved by the simple means of elimination.<br/><br/>The map is divided into forty-nine squares which are numbered horizontally and lettered vertically (fig. 1). There are also fourteen 'location cards' each containing a reproduction of the island map and with either one row or one column shaded (fig. 2). At the beginning of the game, these cards are divided into two packs, one containing the numbered columns and the other the lettered rows. Each pack is shuffled and placed face down and the top card drawn from each. These cards remain unseen and give the exact location of the treasure. For example; should the card with column 3 shaded be drawn together with the card having row F shaded, then the position of the treasure is at square 3F. The twelve remaining cards are shuffled together and dealt equally amongst the players of whom there may be two, three or four.<br/><br/>Each player also receives eight digging tokens. Having looked at the cards in his hand, the first player will place one of his tokens on a square on the map board, say B6. If the player on his left has a card indicating either row B or column 6 or indeed both, then he simply says 'No' and the first player's turn ends with the knowledge that possibly the treasure is not buried anywhere in column 6 and/or row B.<br/><br/>Players continue to place tokens in turn until one of the players suggests the location of the treasure chest. That player then looks at the cards selected at the beginning of the game. If correct, that player wins, if not the cards are replaced face down and that player is out of the game.<br/><br/>A variant suggested by the inventor, which makes a longer but possibly a better game, is where each player only has one token and, after it has been placed on the board during the first round, it may only be moved to an orthogonally, adjacent square on each succeeding turn.<br/><br/>"}, "124224": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1303809.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"40785": {"name": "Aigar Alaveer"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"40785": "Aigar Alaveer"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"14529": {"name": "2D6.EE"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1303809_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;You can make a profit in several ways &ndash; either by producing goods yourself or investing in other players' activities.

These heroes will move in a violent urban universe that is both oppressing and alienating, but which is also marked by the apparition of paranormal phenomena.<br/><br/>The game<br/><br/>At creation, the players choose their faction (agencies, mafias, terrorists, the lost) and the organization (The Agency for Peace, The Cosa Nostra, The Atlantis Brigade, The Dreamers...) which they originate from, plus the reason that made them join the Resistance. Alongside this choice, the players also have the possibility to create a Non-A, a psychic grappling with the paranormal.<br/><br/>The originality [of the game system] comes from the characters' attributes that are not represented by figures but by verbs unto which are associated fields. So, to make an action successful, the player constructs a sentence by using his skills and fields. Then, the number of relevant words being  used are matched with a difficulty threshold in order to have the score to reach with a D10.<br/><br/>Finally, the Ubik, the key element of the rule mechanism: it is a common pool into which the players can slip &quot;dead substance&quot; for situations during which their characters are weakened. The GM can then take some dead substance and forces an hallucination unto the PC. The Ubik can then measure the degradation of the universe and infer that the heroes are lost in reality.<br/><br/>French:<br/><br/>&quot;R&eacute;trofutur est un jeu de r&ocirc;le fran&ccedil;ais &eacute;dit&eacute; par Multisim en 2002.

There are two alike cards for each of these 12 stops These cards are numbered San Francisco 5, New York 10, Gander 15, Shannon 20 and so on, Each succeeding card stop traveling East increases in value by 5 until Shanghai (value 60) is reached.<br/><br/>How to play: Deal 9 cards to each player and place th reminder of the deck face down on the table Players draw a card from the deck either from the face down pile of the face up discard pile and then discard a card. The object is to lay down the 6 map cards showing a complete route from San Francisco to Shanghai. The first 3 cars of the lay down must be done together. The other 3 can be laid down one at a time if so desired, After getting the 6 map cards down the next objective is to get consecutive route card in hand an play the down 3 cards together saying I am getting off in Rome which means that you laid down Paris, Geneva and Rome cards and then discarded the other card in your hand scoring the total value of the cars, in this case 90 (25 for Paris,30 for Geneva and 35 for Rome, so the further east you travel the more points you will score. Completing a flight before an opponent has laid down his map cards gets you a 100 point bonus. When playing partnerships,  you can play on your partners cards until one map of 6 consecutive cards is completed and then either partner can ask &ldquo;Would you like to get off in Bombay or some other stop depending on cards held to which your partner must answer yes or no, in which case the one asking is bound by the response of his partner. However one partner may simply say we are getting of in Paris and then lay down the required cards. Scorekeeper then records the score at the end of each turn. First team to 500 or 100 wins the game<br/><br/>"}, "124287": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Neon Wars", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"164664": "iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1304569.png", "videogametheme": {"2317": "War - Modern"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2346": "Scrolling"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1304569_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Neon Wars  is a fast action scrolling game.

This has led him to take loans from the National Crime Syndicate at outrageous interest rates and deadly penalties for late payment. Kincaid is late on his payment. He&rsquo;s very late. And he&rsquo;s very scared of the penalty. At this point he fears for his life, with good reason, and he&rsquo;s skipping town while the skipping is good. He&rsquo;s called in every favor he could, and he was able to hire an unknown writer, his best prop man, an up and coming starlet who didn&rsquo;t know better, and an aging icon that does know better but yearns for another shot at stardom.<br/><br/>Kincaid has every penny he could beg, borrow, and steal wrapped up in this last ditch effort to get right with the National Crime Syndicate by making a film: Embrace of the Zombie. He&rsquo;s decided to promote his film as a silver screen spectacle by taking his crew to film on location in Haiti, saving all the money that would normally be spent on sets, extras, and props. So far the filming on the action-love story-pulp-thriller is coming along better than expected. That&rsquo;s all about to change.<br/><br/>After a week of filming, Kincaid has taken his crew deep into the bowels of Sans Souci Palace, an exotic looking castle-like structure that has fallen into ruin.

Finally, you must pit your wits against the defences of the Tyrant's palace, including avoiding or nullifying traps, evading guards, and defeating the mighty Warmaster Battle Engine as you close in on the Tyrant himself!<br/><br/>"}, "124334": {"rpg": {"770": "Hollow Earth Expedition"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hollow Sea", "rpgitemversion": {"164760": "PDF version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1302805.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"5830": "Hollow Earth"}, "rpgproducer": {"34282": "Daniel Potter"}, "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"169": "Action / Adventure (Pulp)"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"18177": "Field Notes by Dr. Turner"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1302805_t.png", "description": "From publisher burb:<br/><br/>The Hollow Sea is a dangerous place, especially for an 80-foot Side-wheeler steamer like the S.S.

The first ability may be used on any turn, however the second ability may only be used in Chapters that the Player Character appears in the book.<br/><br/>Secondly, we have the Story Decks which are composed of: Characters, Quotations, and Objects from the book. There are Story Decks for all 12 chapters of the book. Each card may be played for its cost in the Chapter it appears in. Character and Object cards have a Story Point value that adds to a Player's score. Quotation cards are used to complete a Chapter, which is accomplished by playing 3 cards in the appropriate Chapter, but have no Story Point value. Completed Chapters double the points scored while incomplete Chapters score only the card's combined Story Point value.<br/><br/>You may have noticed that I mentioned the cost of playing a card. In Alice: Adventures in Wonderland the currency we use is Tarts. One of the actions a player may take on their turn is taking Tarts. The Tarts are  used to play Story cards. Player's must carefully balance the number of Tarts they have in their possession, because at the end of the game any Tarts they have will count against their final score. They lose 1 Story Point for every Tart they did not return to the tray.<br/><br/>The game board we use in the game is called the Storyboard. Alice travels along a pathway from one chapter to the next, spending only a few turns in most chapters. When Alice moves into a new chapter, cards that players may have in their hands from a previous chapter may no longer be played.<br/><br/>Along the perimeter of the Storyboard is a Story Point Tracker. At the end of each Chapter, players score the cards they played (doubled if they played 3 cards) and all cards from the Chapter (in their hands, played in front of them, or remaining in the chapter's Story Deck) are removed from the game. There is also a Tart Tracker that represents the current number of Tarts each player has in their possession.<br/><br/>In the game, Alice is not a Player Character.

Cardinal Richelieu is centralizing power in the name of King Louis XIII and defends France against those he considers its enemies: the English, the protestants, the Habsburgs and French nobles scheming against him and the crown. Will you side with the cardinal, or will you be seduced by the promise of wealth and power from the queen and foreign nations? Be warned that the cardinal will hinder too ambitious intrigants. Become an influent noble in the court by accumulating prestige and favors. The player most helpful to each faction is also rewarded at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Richelieu is a tactical game with a lot of bluff and interaction, with intrigue everywhere. Every instance of intrigue will pit Cardinal Richelieu against his enemies. The players are nobles taking sides in these intrigues by placing agents with secret values and thus influencing the intrigues. Will you choose to side with Richelieu or the conspirators &ndash; or perhaps even help both? You can keep your support secret or make it directly known to others when placing your agents at the intrigues. It costs money to place agents, but the winning faction gives higher rewards for the players that helped them the most.<br/><br/>The Cardinal's mood is influenced by his success or failures, and he will become intolerant against too influential nobles (i.e. the players), who will have one fewer action to spend during a turn as a result.<br/><br/>There are many possibilities and opportunities to score points for the player who foresees and thwarts the plans of other players. During the game, you will constantly have to choose your side: Will you side with the Cardinal, or will you be seduced by the promise of wealth and power from the Queen and from foreign nations?<br/><br/>Winner of Plateau d'or 2009!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"164804": "Multilingual first edition"}, "name": "Richelieu", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "6.86906", "usersrated": "117", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "age": "10"}, "124357": {"boardgamedesigner": {"60160": {"name": "Caitlin Hogan"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "TriTective", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1615622_t.jpg", "average": "4.88", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"765": {"name": "Educational Insights"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1615622.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"164805": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The 3-letter mystery word game.<br/><br/>1.

These films were written, directed and produced by Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell (among others).  Evil Dead and Evil Dead II were pretty straight-up horror flicks, with a nice dose of slapstick humor in parts.  Army of Darkness really has more action and humor than pure horror (which is perhaps why I like it the best). This game follows the vein of Army of Darkness most closely:  ultimate evil, stalwart and somewhat clueless heroes, and nearly unlimited ammunition.  Players will blast their way through evil deadite spawn, decapitate hellbound demons, and, on occasion, come face to face with unfathomable evil. There will be gore, death, black magic, lost souls, and (hopefully) a strong dose of humor along the way.<br/><br/>So, the Evil has been let loose upon the world.  You're alone in the woods and your girlfriend (EX-girlfriend) just turned into a deadite and ate your best friends.  You've got a flare gun, a gallon of gasoline, and a Louisville Slugger.

Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game.

Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities. (One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.)

The Giant Anaconda is slow and cumbersome on land but stealthy and sleek in the water. While in the water it can be hard to discern its true size. This is due to its color markings , and its eyes and nasal openings are on top of its head; making it able to stay almost completely submerged. This trait makes the Giant Anaconda an excellent ambush hunter. When it attacks it will first bite down on its intended target with its teeth that make it almost impossible to pull out of its bite due to the way the teeth point back. It then coils around its victim suffocating and/or crushing it to death. Then like most snakes it then swallows its meal whole.

So rings the Odynaut motto. To survive, in other words, the Odynauts must keep winning! And now, they have descended on our planet looking for new games wherever they can find them.

The roosters seek to draw as many of them in as possible with their charms. A sly fox is sneaking around the coop for a delicious meal, while the farmer is on a mission to catch him in order to protect his precious little hens.

Danger is lurking.

If you look hard enough, you can find rings of mushrooms, called &quot;fairy rings&quot;, which act as doors between their world and ours. Today, a gang of mischievous goblins escaped from the fairy ring, and it is up to the players to send them back before they cause trouble! But an ancient spell of rhymes which transforms goblins into fairies and fairies into goblins makes this a trickier task than you might think...<br/><br/>Goblins Drool, Fairies Rule!, a card game of rhyme and reason for kids of all ages, is for 2 to 4 players, and has special solitaire rules for a single player. The game takes about 15 minutes to setup and play. The components consist of 20 unique cards, each card having one side representing a Goblin, and another side representing a Fairy. Each side of a card has one of four Symbols: a Sun, a Moon, a Mushroom, or a Frog. The names of the Fairies and Goblins are divided into five rhyming groups, each name ending in one of five sounds.<br/><br/>Players begin the game with 4 cards each, goblin-side-up. Four cards are placed fairy-side-up in the middle of the table, called the &quot;Fairy Ring&quot;. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their Goblins by sending them to the Fairy Ring, or be the first to obtain six Fairies. Players take turns adding one of their cards to the Fairy Ring. When a card is added, any other cards in the Fairy Ring which rhyme with the name on the added card are flipped over: Fairies become Goblins and Goblins become Fairies. Once all rhyming cards have been flipped over, the player then takes any cards from the Fairy Ring which match the symbol on the added card. The first player to end their turn with no more Goblins or with six Fairies wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"164862": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.20458", "name": "Goblins Drool, Fairies Rule!", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "7", "usersrated": "576", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "124391": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Air Force 1945", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"164864": "iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1304589.png", "videogametheme": {"2273": "War - World War II"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2346": "Scrolling"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1304589_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Air Force 1945 is a scrolling flight shooting game.

In this world, they are confronted with cavemen who revere fire above all else. Because not all cavemen have yet discovered how to make fire, some try to steal it from the others. The Odynauts see a challenging game in all of this, but being their usual selves think it would be more fun to put out an opponent's fire rather than to steal it. Can you navigate safely through enemy caves? Can your cavemen outwit their stronger opponents or overpower their weaker ones? Can you be the first to put out an opponent's fire?<br/><br/>Cavemen Playing With Fire is a strategic two-player card game. The goal is to be the first player to put out one of her opponent's three fires, which in game terms means taking one of the opponent's three fire cards.<br/><br/>To play the game, each player receives an identical deck of 25 cave, fire, and caveman cards. Players use the cave cards to create a playing field on the table with three fire cards for each player at each end. In turns, players place cards and take action.

The one place on Earth where lady luck truly smiles at you is the casino. The Odynauts decided to take the gamble and spread out to the foremost gambling cities on our planet, from Macau to Monte Carlo and from Las Vegas to Amsterdam. They turned the casinos upside down and won at every game the casinos have on offer. Slot machines were cleaned out and poker tournaments were won. The casino bosses were not amused and quickly banned the Odynauts from their casinos. To still their voracious appetite for winning, the Odynauts have made their own casino game. Casino chips are bitten into pieces and slot machines are stolen. All these well-known items from the casino form the basis of new and unique game: Chipleader. The Odynauts challenge you. Are you brave enough to accept their challenge? Are you a smart gambler and do you have the strategic insight to score the most points in putting casino chips back together? Can you protect your chips from your opponents' attacks?<br/><br/>Chipleader is card game for two to four players. The goal is to collect as many points as you can with strategic gambling and by making casino chips before four different casinos have been visited. Players have to protect their casino chips against their opponents' attacks in an effort to become Chipleader.<br/><br/>Casino chips are made with chip fragment cards of different colors and values. Every chip fragment card has a quarter of a chip depicted on it. Four chip fragment cards can form a casino chip and only when a player has formed such a chip can she place those cards on the table. The value of a complete casino chip placed on the table can increase or decrease with the use of Odynaut face cards. By playing these cards, a player's opponents can even entirely eliminate the value of one of her chips.<br/><br/>To obtain chip fragment and Odynaut face cards, a player has to make sets with five types of &quot;gamble-suit&quot; cards. Five suit cards are randomly placed face up alongside each other on the table. This row of cards is called the &quot;gambling row&quot;. Each player also receives three suit cards at the beginning of the game. A set is created whenever three, four or five suit cards of the same type are aligned in the gambling row.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"164869": "Odynaut Multilingual first edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Chipleader", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "5.65918", "usersrated": "49", "boardgamefamily": {"21492": "Odynauts"}}, "124396": {"rpg": {"770": "Hollow Earth Expedition"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Pearl Musketball", "rpgitemversion": {"164871": "PDF version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1303910.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"5830": "Hollow Earth"}, "rpgproducer": {"34282": "Daniel Potter"}, "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"169": "Action / Adventure (Pulp)"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"18177": "Field Notes by Dr. Turner"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1303910_t.png", "description": "From publisher burb:<br/><br/>What is the mystery of the statue and oyster bed under the &ldquo;floating island?&rdquo; Is it an ancient garden, where oysters were grown and cultivated or is it just coincidence that they grow so beautifully in the light of the statues crystal sphere?<br/><br/>"}, "124397": {"rpg": {"770": "Hollow Earth Expedition"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Island of Suun", "rpgitemversion": {"164872": "PDF version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1303909.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"5830": "Hollow Earth"}, "rpgproducer": {"34282": "Daniel Potter"}, "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"169": "Action / Adventure (Pulp)"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"18177": "Field Notes by Dr. Turner"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1303909_t.png", "description": "From publisher burb:<br/><br/>In a short time we arrived at the village of Walter, found on the edge of a beautiful green island, covered in rolling hills.

It brings infantry combat in the Star Fleet Universe to life in a way that allows ground battles to be fought simultaneously with the space battles portrayed by Star Fleet Battles, Federation Commander, Starmada, or A Call to Arms SF.<br/><br/>Over 500 unit counters portray squads of five Marines, snipers, engineers, commandos, and heavy weapons; or individual tanks and vehicles; or special game markers.<br/><br/>The very simple &ldquo;shoot then move&rdquo; system reflects the savage horror of war at bayonet point. Fast interaction is created by rules for opportunity fire and defensive snapshots, so both players are constantly acting, reacting, planning, and making hard decisions. Do you fire at those Klingon troops attacking your right flank &mdash; or hold the fire of your weapons for the main attack that has yet to appear (and might never)?<br/><br/>The full-color highly artistic map portrays the terrain on a typical planet far, far away, but rules allow you to designate the colored areas as crops, forest, swamps, marshes, or any of a dozen other types of alien landscape. The map even includes an active volcano and a river of lava!<br/><br/>Each counter is a group of five Marines (i.e., a &quot;Boarding Party&quot; from SFB or a &quot;Marine squad&quot; from FC, facilitating interactions) or a single vehicle (tank, ground combat vehicle, shuttle, or whatever). Each hex is 100 meters. While you can stack a lot of units in one hex (more infantry than vehicles, but still a lot), only a few can fire out of that hex in each direction.<br/><br/>The game system is one of player turns. On your turn, each of your units can either shoot or move, not both. Shooting comes first (after which the unit is turned upside down so that you remember not to move it), then movement, then you turn all of your upside down units right side up. When you shoot at an enemy unit, you cross-index the kind of unit that is shooting with the kind of unit being shot at, adjust this for any terrain that provides protection, and roll one die. The enemy unit might be destroyed, stunned (turned upside down so it won't be able to shoot or move on its next turn), or unharmed.<br/><br/>The first game module, SFM: Assault!, includes Marines, other infantry (commando, heavy weapons, engineers, Prime Teams, militia), and vehicles (tanks, trucks, engineer vehicles, command vehicles, and various light-armored troop carriers).<br/><br/>Units will be able to dig in, call for regular artillery or transporter artillery, do assault landings with shuttles or transporters, do close assaults, use opportunity fire to shoot during the enemy turn, and conduct air strikes with fighters or gunboats.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"164887": "First edition"}, "average": "7.41429", "name": "Star Fleet Marines: Module I \u2013 Assault", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "0", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "14", "boardgamefamily": {"95": "Star Fleet Universe"}}, "124406": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Shank 2", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"164891": "PlayStation 3 PSN edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1529505.jpg", "videogameseries": {"22808": "Shank"}, "videogametheme": {"2277": "Adult / Mature"}, "usersrated": "10", "average": "6.65", "videogamegenre": {"2342": "Beat 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "videogamehonor": {"33149": "2013 CVA Best Animation of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1529505_t.jpg", "description": "The fan-favorite 2D brawler is back as ex-mob hit man Shank returns to action in Shank 2.

Many of the challenges are reminiscent of familiar games. Others are very unique and designed specifically for the roles of Challenger, Opponent and Peanut Gallery. Marble-like gems are the currency. Players must use their intellectual marbles to win challenges and also strategically pose challenges that are to their greatest advantage. Highly dimensional, there are multiple perspectives of strategy.<br/><br/>Players take turns being the Challenger and can select any player not previously an Opponent in the same round. &quot;Teaser&quot; cards indicate Opponent availability. Opponent cards change the dynamics of the challenge. Peanut Gallery cards permit side wagers, further expanding the dimensions of how the game is played.<br/><br/>All challenges are performed in (2) minutes or less. Challenger cards detail a wide variety of tasks across (7) categories:<br/>1) Consensus - The Peanut Gallery is polled to derive a count that the opponent must accurately predict. Some are factual events like visiting an ATM within the last 24 hours while others are preferences such as: Cat or Dog, Chocolate or Vanilla, Paper or Plastic&hellip;<br/>2) Dice - Challenger cards in this category require a specified outcome from the roll of dice. Luck over skill, the tasks vary as defined for each challenge.<br/>3) Domino &ndash; To win, the Opponent must also hold a Challenger card in this category having a Domino number that matches one of the two numbers presented by the Challenger.<br/>4) Performance &ndash; Opponent must skillfully complete the challenge. Examples include telling a joke that invokes laughter and an impersonation in which the Peanut Gallery must correctly guess.<br/>5) Physical &ndash; Another skill category, the Opponent must successfully complete a task involving an activity like Origami (paper folding) or Roshambo (Rock-Paper-Scissors).  When the results are subjective, the Peanut Gallery judges the task.<br/>6) Playing Cards &ndash; A single hand of a common card game is played, such as Blackjack or Draw Poker. Every Challenger card in this category fully defines the task and specifies the requirements necessary to win.<br/>7) Starter &ndash; Cards in this category quickly establish the winner, simply with who holds the highest number.<br/><br/>The objective is simple. Take turns matching a Challenger card in hand with an opponent anticipated least likely to successfully complete the task. Opponents set the wager, either (1) or (2) marbles, upon the Challenger announcing the category. Should the Opponent fail the task, the Challenger wins the wager. Otherwise, the Opponent collects the wager.  Number of players determines the number of rounds. At game end after the final showdown (in case of a tie, if necessary), the player with the most marbles reigns supreme.<br/><br/>Not at all the game of marbles everyone played as a child, this version is all grown up but still retains the youthful retro spirit.<br/>&quot;Wanna play Marbles?&quot;<br/><br/>180 Marbles?

Nine different races of mythical creatures compete for supremacy. Each mythical race is represented by a team consisting of six numbered pieces. Two to nine players control the teams, which maneuver around the board in a counterclockwise fashion. The rules of Siebzehn are simple, but the continuous discovery of new strategies amidst the constantly evolving environment is complex, captivating and magical.<br/><br/>Each team proceeds such that a higher number piece can never pass a lower number piece, and the number 1 piece advances only if no other team pieces can move. Pieces move forward and diagonally in the straightaways and forward only in the turns. The object of the game is to eliminate other races and control the one race that eventually conquers all. Players eliminate opponents from the board by one of three methods:<br/><br/><br/>    Circumnavigate the board and pass the highest number piece of one or more opponents with the 1 piece of one of your teams. This is known as a cataclysm and some teams will be eliminated or altered.<br/>    Pass an opponent's 1 piece with the highest numbered piece of one of your teams. In other words, one team passes an opponent's entire team. The team that is passed is eliminated.<br/>    Control the most advanced 1 piece in games that reach the end of the 17th cycle, known as the siebzehn cycle.<br/><br/><br/>The concept of a race around a large track is central to the essence of Siebzehn, but the game is not a model of any known race. Several racing games involve familiar competitors such as horses, chariots or cars &ndash; then there is Siebzehn, an imaginary mystical race in which the competitors are famed creatures of myth and legend.

While Starfy couldn't understand, a group known as the Terrible Trio arrived inside of Pufftop Palace and grabbed Bunston. Before they could flee away, Starfy used his signature Spin Attack against the Terrible Trio, making them drop Bunston. After Starfy knocked them out, they wondered where Bunston went, and decided to vanish in smoke in order to avoid Starfy and search for Bunston. A short time later, Moe the clam curiously rushed inside the room and asked Starfy what the commotion was all about. Then Starfy didn't answer him and tried to jump into the ocean to pursue Bunston in order to find out about him, while Moe tried to pull Starfy from the edge of the cloud of Pufftop Palace, but then Moe failed to stop Starfy and slowly slid off with him.

An allied army under Wellington stood firm against continued assaults of the French army under Napoleon, counting down the clock to the arrival of the Prussian army under Blucher.<br/><br/>Since that battle, people have often questioned &quot;Why can't I wargame Waterloo on a mobile device?&quot; Well, now you can - as long as you have an Android device.<br/><br/>Napoleonics: Waterloo recreates the battle of Waterloo at the same scale as the already released Napoleonics: Quatre Bras.<br/><br/>The map is the Waterloo battlefield divided into regions, each of which is about 500m across. The map will be familiar to those who have played the boardgames Napoleon's Triumph, or Bonaparte at Marengo - units can be positioned in the centre, or deployed facing an adjacent region.<br/><br/>Each unit represents a brigade. There are 3 types of units, Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery. Cavalry are further subdivided by type (Cuirassiers, Lancers, Hussars, etc.), as are artillery (Field or Horse). Infantry move 2, cavalry move 3. Field artillery can either move 1 or fire (range of 3 - with chance of hitting affected by line of sight, range, terrain, target formation). Horse artillery fires (range 2) or moves 2, or moves 1 and fires, but only range 1.<br/><br/>Units are deployed as column, line or square, each of which has their own advantages or disadvantages. In addition, you cannot move all your forces at once, but must activate them as the game progresses.<br/><br/>The game can be played as 2 player hotseat, or else as either side against the computer AI. Victory is determined by capture of objectives and also strength and unit losses. Several variations allow you to tailor a game to your interests:<br/><br/>Fog of war - can be on or off.<br/>Limit rallies - units cannot regain their full strength once they have been injured.<br/>Change number of activations per turn - independently for either side.<br/>Change when the Prussians arrive - have them arriving historically, early, late, never(!), or randomise when they arrive.<br/><br/>Hal reinforcements: Wellington had reserves within marching distance at the town of Hal. He never called on them, but could have done.<br/><br/>Voila, ici Grouchy! French Marshall Grouchy fought his own battle against some of the Prussian army at Ligny on the same day as Waterloo. He had the option to march to Waterloo instead and this option adds his entire wing arriving as reinforcements.<br/><br/>The game can be saved at any point and last actions can be undone using the back button (this can also be disabled, if playing hotseat). At the end of the game, you have the option to either continue playing (night never falls!) or else review the battlefield at your leisure.<br/><br/>NB - large screen phone/tablet better<br/><br/>"}, "124494": {"boardgamedesigner": {"60198": {"name": "Bert Houweling"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Meisterrechner", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "6", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1350908_t.png", "average": "5.16667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"302": {"name": "Spiel Spass"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1350908.png", "boardgameversion": {"165082": "Spiel Spass Edition 2008"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In this game players use the four basic arithmetic operations.
