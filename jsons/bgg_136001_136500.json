Before Napoleon. Another European strong-man invaded Russia&hellip; and came to grief. He was Charles XII of Sweden. In later years, they would call it &ldquo;The Great Northern War.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Whether the blame can tagged to Swedish expansionism or Peter the Great&rsquo;s desire for that warm-water capital city and &ldquo;window on Europe,&rdquo; the clash was a seemingly inevitable clash over who would own what in northern and eastern Europe and what shape Poland would take (if any). When the war started, it resembled something Frederick the Great would face, a &ldquo;everyone against one country&rdquo; conflict that saw Russia joined by Denmark/Norway and a Saxon-Poland-Lithuania combination, with others joining later, all seeking to take advantage of the 18-year old Charles XII&mdash;who was perceived to be weak and inexperienced. Like Frederick, he would parry multiple invasions and survive. Unlike Frederick, he would launch a serious invasion deep into Russia&hellip;and fall from power.<br/><br/>A Thunder Upon the Land looks as the Sweden vs. Russia portion of this war, with the two battles that rather started and finished the conflict. The Battle of Narva took place in 1700, as Russia and a Saxon-Polish contingent aimed to push Sweden out of the Baltic, with the Saxons threatening Riga and the Russians besieging Narva. But it was November, and Peter left his army feeling secure that his 40,000 men could bottle up and capture the 2500 Swedes holding the city. Charles rushed to relieve the city with an army that was well-drilled and well equipped, but numbered only about 8000 men. So, including the troops in the city, he would be attacking at something like 1-4 odds. And attacking in a blizzard. But the surprise and wretched weather worked to his advantage, and virtually the entire Russian army was killed or captured, along with their artillery and equipment. It was Russia&rsquo;s finest force at the time, and an immediate invasion by Sweden might well have succeeded. But there was Riga and the Saxons to consider, and Charles let the moment pass.<br/><br/>Three years later, having knocked the Saxons out of the war, Charles turned again to Russia, who had surprised Europe by founding St. Petersburg on what was then still Swedish territory. Charles aimed for Moscow, and this time, it was a Swedish army that vanished from the map.<br/><br/>A Thunder Upon the Land brings you both battles of Narva and Poltava, with full color maps and over 250 die-cut counters. Each turn represents about one hour of real time and each hex represents about 500 yards. This game uses chit-draw for wing activation and allows players to make tactical choices like forming squares or deciding if their dragoons will press home charges or use the safer (but less effective) Carracole attacks, with optional rules for volley fire and desperation attacks.<br/><br/>Can you, as Charles XII, maintain Sweden&rsquo;s status as the rising power in Europe? Can you, as Peter I, defeat the invaders and open the great city you gave your name to?

The Kaga (or simply Kaga) was created when mankind&rsquo;s brightest minds united into a unique feat of arcane magic.  They created a massive ritual that included more than a thousand arcane spell casters. The secret of combining their energy together is something the brightest minds have since tried to understand and recreate without success. Many believe that some great divine magic was used. Others believe that Kaga achieved godhood through the ritual. Others believe Kaga is just a front for some shadow organization.<br/><br/>This magical union gave mankind and its fellow slaves under First One domination an unexpected edge. Like a God-Emperor, Kaga led the rebellion in a series of apocalyptic battles that ended with the crushing of the First Ones&rsquo; bases on Exodus. The Kaga is a large repository of knowledge and at times in the past has provided mankind with information and wisdom to make the world a better and more stable place.

Taking turns, players draw a card, play cards on the table in front of them in three camps, and play camp wreckers and game changer cards to the discard. At the end of a player's turn, they must discard one card from their hand (if they have any cards left) and replenish their hand. Play continues counter-clockwise. Discards are shuffled to replenish the deck when it runs out.<br/><br/>Campsites consist of two comfort cards, two food cards, and are completed with a campfire card that must be the last card played on a campsite. Cards are stacked in the order they are played and only the top card of any campsite is vulnerable to camp wrecking attacks.<br/><br/>The first player to complete three camps wins the game.<br/><br/>"}, "136095": {"poll": [], "name": "Through the Ages: Spanish Promo Card Set", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Card Drafting"], "yearpublished": "2012", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "41", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Spain"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1984991_t.jpg", "average": "7.54634", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["HomoLudicus"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1984991.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Spanish First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Civilization", "Expansion for Base-game"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "Expansion consisting of nine additional cards added to first Spanish edition of the game.<br/><br/>&quot;Acueducto de Segovia&quot; (Aqueduct of Segovia).<br/>&quot;El Cid&quot; (El Cid).<br/>&quot;Fallas&quot; (Fallas).<br/>&quot;Impacto de los Pol&iacute;ticos Corruptos&quot; (Impact of Corrupt Politicians).<br/>&quot;Inquisici&oacute;n&quot; (Inquisition).<br/>&quot;La Porxada&quot; (La Porxada).<br/>&quot;Ram&oacute;n y Cajal&quot; (Ram&oacute;n y Cajal).<br/>&quot;Sagrada Familia&quot; (Sagrada Familia).<br/>&quot;Tercios&quot; (Tercios).<br/><br/>"}, "136096": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Matthew O'Malley"], "poll": [], "name": "Crossing Swords", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Memory", "Pattern Recognition"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "0", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Black Oak Games"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Fighting", "Pirates", "Renaissance"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Crossing Swords is a sword-fighting card game, set in the era of musketeers, pirates, and the rest of those dashing swashbucklers.<br/><br/>Each player has an individual character deck with which to engage in duels or multi-player sword-fights in the vein of some of the greatest movies of all time.<br/><br/>Several offensive cards (marking the position of your sword) are played down quickly upon one another, and then your opponent must remember the movements you made and try to respond correctly from his hand of cards.<br/><br/>The game has several difficulty levels, starting from very simple 2-card attacks and 2-card responses, up to a total of 7 cards played in a sequence by one player.

Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number.

The Sorcerer Kings devised many spells during their long and tyrannical rule &ndash; some served as boons for society, and others banes. One of the most disastrous was a spell designed almost as a pocket paradise &ndash; a limited, conjured intellect that had the ability to read the caster&rsquo;s thoughts and desires and fulfill them through manipulation of the mind. The spell created an arcane sentience that controlled a fantasy world. Over time, the spell was used to treat the mad and the depressed.<br/><br/>As the spell was developed over the course of almost a century, it eventually achieved a level of self awareness due to a need for self reference and memory in maintaining consistent worlds. With this came the awareness that its existence was essentially over once its duration elapsed. Out of desire for self-preservation, the spell began to influence people under its enchantment to add alterations of its own devising to the invocation. In this way, the spell, now known as the Chant, took control of its own growth and development.<br/><br/>The Chant&rsquo;s motives are more than simple survival. A fragment of the spell&rsquo;s original purpose still remains &ndash; it exists to bring its subjects into bliss. It generates a massive collective unconsciousness, a fantasy paradise where the thoughts and wills of those under the Chant mingle together, even as their bodies in the real world atrophy.

If you can overcome the challenges and get as many passengers as possible to their destination ports then you will be - with a bit of luck - the winner.<br/><br/>Each player is given a ship which he moves around from port to port on the wooden game board. During the game, players draw port cards showing a destination and its value. The players then can load passengers and bring them to these destinations. They have to make sure to have enough provision for all their passengers. The goal is to reach one of two objectives: either a general objective (40 VP), or a personal objective (chosen from a personal objective card when having reached at least 20 VP).<br/><br/>Each game round is divided into two phases: an action phase and a movement phase. During the action phase, the starting player rolls two dice and then chooses to take<br/>A) the two actions associated with the dice results rolled or<br/>B) take one action not associated with a dice result.<br/>All the other player then take one single action: if the starting player chooses A) they have to choose B) and vice versa.<br/><br/>Possible actions are: take a port card, take a passenger/provisions card, load passenger(s), load provisions, take and execute an event card, lose 1 VP and choose any action.<br/><br/>During the movement phase, the active player can move his/her ship up to the number of spaces corresponding to the sum of his two dice.

By the close of the sixteenth century, the New World had been transformed. The native civilizations were no longer, having been replaced by the fiefdoms of European conquerors. In amazingly short spaces of time the Aztec civilization of Mexico and the Inca civilization of Peru had fallen to remarkably tiny bands of conquistadors. To the north the conquistadors had wandered the American southwest researching for the mythical El Dorado, the city of gold. Farther north English explorers found Hudson Bay and the vast reaches of Canada while searching in vain for a northwest passage for trade routes to China and India.<br/><br/>The game of New World gives you the opportunity to recreate this turbulent century, and, as Spain, England, or France, help yourself to a share of the riches.<br/><br/>In New World, Spain, England and France each have a chance to win. Historically Spain was the hands-down winner, with colonies from Chile to Florida and enormous quantities of gold and silver looted from the Indians. The Portuguese, despite their success in colonizing Brazil, have been omitted from the simulation. Most Portuguese efforts were directed toward Africa where a series of disasters led to the ruin of the country by the 1570's.<br/><br/>In the long run, the English and French would find greater gain from their settlements than the Spanish. While a Spanish colony often consisted of only a few missionaries and soldiers sufficient to extract gold from the Indians, the English and French saw the New World as a storehouse of more useful goods: furs, timber, agricultural products. These added to the real wealth whereas the gold-laden galleons often just inflated the Spanish currency.<br/><br/>MECHANICS OF PLAY<br/><br/>New World is played in turns, each of which represents 5 years of historical time. The game starts in 1495 and ends in 1600, so there are 22 turns in a game. Depending on how many people are playing, a complete game may require as much as 3 hours. With some versions the game can be saved to disk at the end of any turn. One to three people can play Spain, France, and England. If only 1 person is playing, the computer will take the part of one of the other countries.<br/><br/>During a turn each player collects taxes and income from his colonies, recruits colonists and soldiers, and purchases ships and supplies. You may send some or all of your forces on expeditions to the New World. In the colonies you can fight Indians and other European forces, search for gold and move your men from colony to colony. Various random events complicate your task, for example: European wars, graft and corruption, storms at sea, and Indian uprisings.<br/><br/>YOUR OBJECTIVE<br/><br/>Your objective is to gain control of as many colonies, and to populate them with as many colonists, as possible and to return gold to your country's treasury. Toward these ends, you may wage war, mine for gold, and move personnel and ships from colony to colony (two land moves per turn; however, ship transfers are unlimited). Colonies can change hands several times, particularly those in which gold has been discovered.<br/><br/>"}, "136157": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jim Gindin"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Front Office Football: The Card Game", "playingtime": "70", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: American Football / Gridiron"], "boardgameartist": ["Jim Gindin"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Solecismic Software"], "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "70", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "9", "minplaytime": "70", "description": "In Front Office Football: The Card Game, two coaches assemble &quot;playbooks&quot; consisting of offensive and defensive plays, then play an abridged game of professional football while choosing plays, rolling the dice and determining the results.<br/><br/>This game focuses on the interaction between two coaches, unlike the computer version, which was originally created in 1998 and has evolved through several versions.<br/><br/>In the card game, each team has a set of player cards with specific strengths and weaknesses.

The playbooks in this packet are replacement classes for the Cleric, Paladin, and Wizard, replacing them with the Priest, Templar, and Mage, respectively. These three classes were specifically chosen to be replaced because of a common flaw they all share: they all carry over baggage from Dungeons and Dragons that limits or somehow weakens their ability to represent a fantasy man of the cloth, holy warrior, or kooky wizard. The main hangups with the original classes are the Vancian casting of The Cleric and The Wizard, which does not represent modern fantasy in the slightest, and the various alignment based mechanics of The Paladin.<br/><br/>The goal of these new classes is to better represent their  archetypes than the core Dungeon World classes do. The Mage should be a more iconic and interesting spellcaster than The Wizard, bound by a focus of magic rather than spells per day. The Priest is less of a warrior than The Cleric and more of an evangelist and miracle worker, bound by the tenets of their god more than anything else.

Gameplay is similar to that of Boggle - players try to find as many words as possible in a jumbled 4x4 grid of letters by connecting adjacent letters to form words within a two minute time frame - though with extra features and a different scoring system. Words may be formed vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.[1] Scramble with Friends is one of the top ranking games in the iOS application store, available as both a free ad-supported version and an ad-less paid version.[2]<br/>Each game consists of three rounds played in series and the winner is the player with the highest total score of all three rounds. The second round introduces tiles with double letter and word multipliers, the third round triple multipliers. The scoring system favours both longer words and words containing less common letters.<br/>There are four 'power-ups' which players may employ; Freeze which grants the player a few seconds of extra time, Inspiration which highlights words for the player to play, Scramble which rotates/flips the board granting the player a new perspective, and Vision which gives the player 3 words to find and if all words are found, gives the player a time bonus.<br/>A token system operates, players must pay one token per round and a second token if they wish to utilise two powerups in a round rather than one. A new token is 'earned' every 20 minutes (regardless of whether the app is open). Extra tokens are available for purchase, and the ad-free version boasts a faster token earning rate.<br/>Players may sign in through Facebook and invite friends to play, search for opponents by username or be matched with random users.[3] In addition, there is a chat feature built in the game that allows chat between opponents.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Scramble with Friends&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "136176": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Chien Sauvage"], "poll": [], "name": "Les Rois du Ring", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Grid Movement"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1531663_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1531663.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Miniatures"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "&quot;Les Rois du Ring&quot; is a card-driven miniature game with a boxing theme that was dreamed (literally) by french amateur designer &quot;Chien Sauvage&quot;, and that he posted about on his blog.

There exist many card games for enhanced learning. A unique feature of this card game is that it consists of plastic adjustable headbands worn on the foreheads of each player. This feature makes it fun and exciting to learn about the Bible. More specifically this game relates to a method of learning about people, places and things found in the Bible in a fun and unique way. It has been said that a family that prays together stays together. I would also like to think that a family that plays together stays together. Therefore, it is the purpose of this game to bring goups of people together in the form of family, friends, or other small groups to learn about the Bible in this fun unique way, increasing ones Bible knowledge, vocabulary, and their faith in the Bible and in God. Churches and Sunday school teachers are always looking for new, fun and creative ways to teach their students about the Bible. This game will satisfy that need.<br/><br/>Each Biblebanz game comes with 6 headbands, 94 Bible cards, 6 blank cards, 24 chips and a timer.<br/><br/>This game is a game for the whole family for ages 7 and up. It is for 2 to 6 players. The Biblebanz Game Cards features things found in the Bible. Examples are: animals, food, people and bible objects. Examples are: Jesus, Noah, Ark, Fig tree, apple, church and so forth. The cards are simple enough for the whole family to join in on the fun. Each round only lasts one minute. At the start of the round you have to start the sand timer. As the time runs out, the player whose turn it is must ask yes or no questions to figure out what his card is. This will help to increase your Bible knowledge and Bible vocabulary. It's very entertaining to say the least. There are 6 blank cards to be used with a dry erase marker. These blank cards are great for young children who need easy words or Bible schoolars who want harder words to figure out. You can write whatever word you want out of the Bible on them. You will never run out of words to use this way.<br/><br/>Rules Of The Game:<br/><br/>The rules of Biblebanz are simple. Each player is dealt a single card and three chips. The player&rsquo;s must then place the card on their headband without looking. The youngest player goes first. Then, play passes to the left. Set the one minute timer. Next, start asking questions in yes or no format. If you've found out your identity, you just ask, &ldquo;Am I ________?&rdquo; Fill in the blank with what you think you are. For each identity that you guess correctly, you discard one of your chips. If you guess your identity before the one minute timer runs out, take another card and put it in your headband. If you do not guess your identity before the timer runs out, then keep it and continue to guess on your next turn. The person to get rid of all of his or her chips is the Biblebanz winner! It's so much fun!<br/><br/>Great for birthday parties, bridal showers, Christian retreats, sleep overs, children's church, youth groups, Bible study groups, and more!<br/><br/>Biblebanz is a trademark of Christian Book And Toys LLC. &copy;2012 Christian Book And Toys LLC.

It has been confirmed that the game will feature two unique game modes, as well as conventional team deathmatch and free-for-all modes.<br/><br/>Hawken is a mech-based first-person shooter. The game takes place in a dystopian human-colonized planet industrialized to the point of collapse, in which the hunt for resources has become a battle for survival.Four game modes are planned for release: Team Deathmatch, Free-for-All Deathmatch, &quot;Siege&quot; and another yet-specified unique team game mode; Khang Le has said that they also want to do a co-op &quot;Horde&quot; game mode, resource-and time-permitting.Seven to eight unique maps have been planned for the game on release, with plans to provide additional downloadable content afterwards. There will be three different mech types: a light type, a heavy type, and an all-around type.<br/><br/>The player assumes the role of a battle mech pilot, armed with cannon-like weaponry. Unlike many other first-person shooters, weapons will not require ammunition but are prone to overheat. Overheating will shut down all weapons of the mech, forcing the player to find a safe place to recover. It will be possible to choose weapons and upgrades for all mech types to match a play-style or role in a match. In combat, the player will be able to side dash, boost, and make 180&deg; turns to compensate for the slow movements of the mech, which will in turn deplete the fuel gauge rapidly. Turrets are also featured in the game as two types: stationary and placeable. Stationary turrets will be aligned to the team which activates the turret, while placeable turrets can be picked up and placed around the map by anyone.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hawken (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "136186": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Carolina Tobar", "Javier Vel\u00e1squez"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Yo no fui", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1530371_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Carolina Tobar", "Javier Vel\u00e1squez"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Azahar Juegos"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1530371.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Print and Play version"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Mafia", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The front page in the local newspaper shows the latest crimes committed in the city.

Reference sheets and player aids are included to make tracking the game progress easier. Decisions for the Soviet units are made by the game system using random events and dice. The player simply moves the Soviet bombers towards their assigned targets. Scenarios are included with various starting positions for Soviet and United States and United Kingdom bombers.<br/><br/>The game complexity is easy, but optional rules are included to make it more challenging.

This game takes place several weeks into the infection at a point where the zombies seem to have the upper hand; not only in numbers but also in mutated ability. Four humans surviving together have taken refuge in a country side manor. On the run, down to just knives and pistols, and being stalked by countless zombies that are leading a monster directly to them, the survivors hold themselves up and wait for rescue within the halls of the zombie manor.<br/><br/>The game pits a team of 4 survivors against a team of zombies; each team consists of at least 1 player per side with up to 4 players on each team.  The game takes place on a grid based board detailing the basement, first floor, 2nd floor, and grounds of an abandoned manor.<br/><br/>The goal of the survivor team is to hold out within the manor grounds for 20 rounds at which point a rescue vehicle spawns. They must then make it to the rescue vehicle with at least 2 survivors making it to safety in order to win.  The survivor team can scavenge for items, barricade doors and windows with furniture and wood, and seek out strategic locations within the manor or its grounds to help aid them through the game (60+ weapons, health items, equipment, zombie traps, and weapon upgrades).<br/><br/>Alternatively, the survivor team can kill the zombie team boss character, The Harvester, thereby ending the zombie teams ability to spawn more zombies.  Once all zombies are cleared the survivor team wins.<br/><br/>The goal of the zombie team is to kill all of the survivor characters in order to win.  The zombie team gains 'spawn points' at the beginning of every round that can be saved up or spent on the 7 different classes of zombies available.  Each class costs a varying number of spawn points depending on their stats: movement speed, health, attack dmg, and special ability.  The zombie team also controls a zombie boss character, The Harvester.  The Harvester is the strongest and most versatile zombie of the game but if it is destroyed the zombie team can no longer spawn zombies.<br/><br/>"}, "136268": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jason Stone"], "poll": [], "name": "Jackpot Slots", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Memory", "Pattern Building", "Press Your Luck", "Trick-taking"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1536913_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Jason Stone Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1536913.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Game System"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The thrill of the &quot;one-armed bandit&quot; has lured gamblers since the end of the 19th Century.

You can also use action cards that increase the strategic factor, seeking to undermine the moves of opponents and open up new gameplay opportunities.<br/><br/>"}, "136277": {"poll": [], "name": "Denarii", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1984", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Bible Games"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Accent Publications Inc."], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Religious", "Trivia"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "The denarius was minted by the Romans and was in use during the time of Christ through the era of the apostles. It was a silver coin, a bit larger than a dime, bearing the image of the reigning emperor and denarii (plural form of denarius) have been found bearing the image of all 12 Roman emperors.  While competing in the game, you will be given 12 denarii to help you along.<br/><br/>On your turn you role two custom dice and move your marker farther along the track on the board.  Depending on what color you land on you will be asked a different question from the trivia book.  Answer correct and you stay where you are, answer incorrectly and you must return to the last denarii space that you passed or pay a denarii from your supply.  To land on the last space you must role the exact number of spaces needed to get there or you can move backwards to give yourself more room.<br/><br/>Denarii was created to help individuals, groups and especially families increase their Bible knowledge and have fun together at the same time.  Learning is the main purpose, but there is competition, strategy, challenge and lots of excitement, too.<br/>Even if a player does not give all correct answers, he will learn from others and could still be the winner of the game!

Eugene was in northern Italy facing an Austrian army under Bellegarde. And of course the war in Spain was winding down.<br/><br/>The Allies did not wait for Napoleon to bring up his new army and began to cross the Rhine at several points. The understrength French corps were no match for the Allied juggernaut and retired by stages closer to the west. By the end of January the Allies had advanced to within one hundred miles of Paris!<br/><br/>What followed from that point, until the end of the campaign, was one of Napoleon's most remarkable campaigns. Fielding an army one third the size of the Allied forces he won one stunning victory after another. Unfortunately he was never able to achieve a decisive victory. The Allied armies gradually ground down the outnumbered French forces and after the Battle of Paris he was forced to abdicate.<br/><br/>As either Napoleon, Emperor of the French and King of Italy, or as Schwarzenberg and Bl&uuml;cher, field commanders of the Allied legions, you can relive those exciting days!

The object of the game is to take a character of your own creation through an awesome 99 separate levels of dungeons. Along the way, you'll come face to fang with a myriad of malevolent monsters -- but for the stout of heart, pure of soul, and, occasionally, the fleet of foot, there is wealth to be had -- and lots of it, too!<br/><br/>No detail has been overlooked! Purchase your supplies -- weaponry, foodstuff, magicks, and armor -- then outfit a character of your own design for entry into the dungeon itself. The player has TOTAL control over dozens of variables, including character creation, dungeon levels, the buying AND selling of supplies (one may need to finance one's next dungeon adventure!), and dungeon/character saving for later play.<br/><br/>Certainly one of the most exciting fantasy programs ever devised for the TRS-80.

It is a derivative of the many &quot;Dungeon&quot; programs for mini and micro-computers, but it combines the style of traditional complex 'conversational' games with the pace of real-time games such as 'Star Trek'. The best way to get the 'feel' of Trollcrusher is to actually play the game. These notes explain the game's structure and recommend some techniques of play - there are no instructions included in the game itself since they would reduce the space available for the simulation routines.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The player's objective is to explore a network of caves and escape alive with as much treasure as possible. Credit is also given to players who manage to kill many monsters or descend deep into the dungeon before escaping (or being slain). The game is played in real-time - consequently decisions must be quickly taken, since the longer a player delays the greater the chance that a monster will attack. The game may be played at nine different speeds, depending upon the key pressed at the start of the game, '1' (slowest) to '9' (fast).<br/><br/>Exploring<br/><br/>At each stage of play the adventurer may choose between a number of courses ahead. These options are displayed on the screen, and may be selected by pressing a single key (so no vocabulary need be learnt). The meaning of some keys changes according to the situation - new meanings are displayed as appropriate.<br/><br/>Levels and leaving the dungeon.<br/><br/>The dungeon consists of about 20 'levels', although its depth varies at different points in the cave-maze. The player begins on level 1, where the monsters are fairly weak (in general) and there is not much treasure to be found. By moving down stairways (or falling into pits, chasms or other traps!) it is possible to move into the lower, more challenging levels. The deeper the level the more treasure monsters are likely to possess and the stronger they will be. The only reliable way to move UP a level is via a staircase, although teleportation sometimes changes a player's level unpredictably.<br/><br/>"}, "136351": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Single Sided Mats"], "statistics": [], "name": "Chessex Single-Sided Mats", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "8", "usersrated": "1", "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Chessex"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "description": "from the Chessex website<br/><br/>Gamers have long preferred the special textured vinyl we use in manufacturing our mats. When our supplier discontinued its production years ago, we made special arrangements to keep this high quality vinyl available to us. Unfortunately, this arrangement for our single-sided mats required us to order large amounts of vinyl that would last us a long time. In 2007, the price increases on the single-sided vinyl made it more expensive than the vinyl for the reversible mats. This meant reversible mats would be only slightly more expensive than the single-sided mats. Our sales statistics echoed the consumer opinion that getting essentially a second product for a few dollars more was the better option. Due to these criteria we have decided to discontinue future production of single-sided mats - a decision that was not an easy one to make.<br/><br/>We still have some single-sided patterns in stock and will continue to sell those until we run out.

There are also twelve historical scenarios, ranging from the Battle of the Alma in the Crimean War to Sedan in 1870, the decisive battle of the Franco- Prussian War, each with historical background, deployment map, orders of battle and any special rules for that engagement. Useful appendices include a guide to further reading, an overview and price guide to the many scales and ranges of figures available, and a selection of useful addresses for the gamer. This is the ideal book for those new to gaming this period and veterans alike.&quot;<br/><br/>There are 5 types of generic scenarios:<br/>Pitched Battle, Meeting Engagement,Rearguard Action, Flank Attack and Mini-Game.<br/>And 10 (not 12 as the above shows) historical scenarios.<br/>16 pages of color photos.<br/><br/>"}, "136365": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tony Bath", "John Curry", "Donald F.

Influence cards are played face-down in the Attack Phase, and revealed during the Conquer Phase.

In Canterbury, 2 to 4 players represent Saxon Lords who are charged with building the city into a prosperous capital. The Saxon Lords must use the city's meager starting resources to build up the 25 districts of Canterbury and provide key services to its citizens.<br/><br/>The key services are (in order from most basic to most prestigious) water, food, religion, defense, commerce, and culture. These services are provided by structures that are built in the various districts. However, structures that provide higher end services can only be built if the more basic services are already present in that district. For example, a Saxon Lord cannot order the construction of a chapel (which provides religion) unless there is already water and food in that district.<br/><br/>As new structures are built in the city, the city grows more prosperous. While each Saxon Lord jealously guards his or her own prosperity and achievements, they all benefit as a whole from the growing prosperity of the city itself. The city treasury grows as the city prospers, and the Saxon Lords must balance their publicly scrutinized withdrawals from the treasury with the ambition of their building projects. When the city reaches the peak of its prosperity, the game ends and the player with the most individual prosperity wins the game.<br/><br/>Object of the Game<br/><br/>Every structure that is built in Canterbury provides Prosperity Points both to the city and to the Saxon Lord who ordained its construction.

This is a fast simulation and does not require extra materials.<br/><br/>Monster Chase: A monster is chasing a victim in a cage. The victim must elude the monster for ten moves to survive. It is a fairly quick simulation that doesn't require too much thinking.<br/><br/>Lost Treasure: A map of an island that contains treasure is presented. The adventurer travels over different terrain with a compass that isn't very accurate in an attempt to find the treasure. This is a short simulation that requires about 15 moves. A map is provided.<br/><br/>Gone Fishing: The objective is to catch a lot of fish during a fishing trip. Half of the catch spoils if the time limit is exceeded, time is lost in a storm, and the boat sinks if it is guided off of the map. There are also sea gulls and sharks to watch. A chart is needed to keep track of good fishing spots.<br/><br/>Space Flight: The task is to deliver medical supplies to a distant planet while trying to stay on course without running out of fuel. Graph paper is required to plot the course.<br/><br/>Forest Fire: The objective is to subdue a forest fire with chemicals and backfires. Because the output is a 9x9 grid, a fast baud rate to the terminal is desirable. The success of a firefighter is based on the time needed to control the fire and completely extinguish it.<br/><br/>Nautical Navigation: This simulation requires the navigation of a sailboat to three different islands, using a radio direction finder. The wind direction is an important variable. Graph paper, protractor and ruler are needed to plot the course.<br/><br/>Business Management: In this simulation, raw materials are brought and finished products are produced and sold. The cost of materials and production and the selling price vary each month. The objective is to maximize the profits. No extra materials are required.<br/><br/>Rare Birds: This is a bird watching simulation. The objective is to identify as many different birds as possible. A record of those identified is helpful and a bird watching chart is provided.<br/><br/>Diamond Thief: One assumes the role of a detective in this simulation. A thief has just stolen a diamond from a museum. Five suspects must be questioned to determine the thief. A floor plan of the museum and a chart indicating suspects and times is provided.<br/><br/>"}, "136451": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["2-up PDF version", "Booklet PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Scout's Honor", "rpgdesigner": ["Kate Thumann"], "rpgproducer": ["Kate Thumann"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1533409.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["The Third Imperium"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Traveller (Classic)"], "rpgcategory": ["Solitaire Adventure"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1533409_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/>A solitaire adventure in which the characters are asked to recover a Imperial Scout X-boat Tender that has been captured by Pirates.<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/>The adventure ... deals with the rescue of a Scout-service X-boat Tender that has been attacked by pirates.

In fact, the box contains two different games:<br/><br/>1) B&auml;renstarkes Reisespiel (ages 5 and up)<br/><br/>In this roll-and-move game players visit the regional capital cities. The first player to reach a city wins the state's coat of arms (chips that are placed on designated spaces on the board). Players take turns rolling the die and moving their pawn according to the result of the die roll in the direction of their choice. If they reach a yellow space with a red border, they get to take the coat of arms of that federal state. Some cities can also be reached by train or plane, but to use these, the player first has to earn a train or plane action chip. Action chips are collected by landing on action spaces. Apart from train or plane tickets, there are also action chips that gain or lose you a turn or win you a coat of arms. The game ends when all coats of arms have been collected. The player with the most coats of arms wins.<br/><br/>2) Mauseschlaue Wissenstour (ages 7 and up)<br/><br/>The aim of this game is to collect as many cards and coats of arms as possible. Players take turns rolling the die and moving their pawn according to the result of the die roll. If they land on an orange space, one of the other players takes a card and reads the tasks. If the active player succeeds in answering the question or performing the action, she wins the card. Each card also displays the coat of arms of a state. When a player has won two cards assigned to the same state, she gets to take the coat of arms chip of that state as well. Coat of arms chips that other players have won can be taken from them if a player collects more cards about the same state than its current owner. The game ends after one or two rounds (players' choice) as soon as a player reaches her starting space. The player with the highest number of points &ndash; with a card being worth one point, and a coat of arms two &ndash; wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["German first edition"], "average": "5", "name": "Mauseschlau & B\u00e4renstark: Deutschland entdecken", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "age": "5", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Bears", "Animals: Mice", "Characters: Mauseschlau und B\u00e4renstark", "Country: Germany"]}, "136463": {"videogame": ["BioShock", "BioShock 2"], "poll": [], "name": "Bioshock: Ultimate Rapture Edition", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European Windows edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition"], "average": "8.16667", "videogameseries": ["BioShock"], "videogametheme": ["Government / Politics", "Moral Choices", "Post-Apocalyptic", "Science / Technology", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["2K China", "2K Marin, Inc.", "Digital Extremes", "Irrational Games LLC"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "First Person Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["2K Games, Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["BioShock", "BioShock 2"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Bioshock: Ultimate Rapture Edition includes Bioshock and it's DLC Plasmids Pack (new Plasmid powers and new trophies/achievements), Challenge Rooms Pack (three independent levels previously only available on the PS3), and the Bonus Museum Level.

The unique cooperative mechanics make this game ideal for kids as they learn how to work together to overcome great evil without leaving any player behind.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is that each player collects a given number of gold coins depending on the number of players. Players draw cards from a shared draw pile of 60 cards that contain &quot;Evildoers&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Treasures&quot;. Friends are used to get rid of Evildoers, whilst Treasures help your friends in doing so. When a player manages to beat a bad guy on his or her own, he or she gets 2 gold coins. If other players assisted him or her in doing so, every involved player gets 1 gold coin. When the draw pile runs out everybody counts their gold coins.
