Before Napoleon. Another European strong-man invaded Russia&hellip; and came to grief. He was Charles XII of Sweden. In later years, they would call it &ldquo;The Great Northern War.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Whether the blame can tagged to Swedish expansionism or Peter the Great&rsquo;s desire for that warm-water capital city and &ldquo;window on Europe,&rdquo; the clash was a seemingly inevitable clash over who would own what in northern and eastern Europe and what shape Poland would take (if any). When the war started, it resembled something Frederick the Great would face, a &ldquo;everyone against one country&rdquo; conflict that saw Russia joined by Denmark/Norway and a Saxon-Poland-Lithuania combination, with others joining later, all seeking to take advantage of the 18-year old Charles XII&mdash;who was perceived to be weak and inexperienced. Like Frederick, he would parry multiple invasions and survive. Unlike Frederick, he would launch a serious invasion deep into Russia&hellip;and fall from power.<br/><br/>A Thunder Upon the Land looks as the Sweden vs. Russia portion of this war, with the two battles that rather started and finished the conflict. The Battle of Narva took place in 1700, as Russia and a Saxon-Polish contingent aimed to push Sweden out of the Baltic, with the Saxons threatening Riga and the Russians besieging Narva. But it was November, and Peter left his army feeling secure that his 40,000 men could bottle up and capture the 2500 Swedes holding the city. Charles rushed to relieve the city with an army that was well-drilled and well equipped, but numbered only about 8000 men. So, including the troops in the city, he would be attacking at something like 1-4 odds. And attacking in a blizzard. But the surprise and wretched weather worked to his advantage, and virtually the entire Russian army was killed or captured, along with their artillery and equipment. It was Russia&rsquo;s finest force at the time, and an immediate invasion by Sweden might well have succeeded. But there was Riga and the Saxons to consider, and Charles let the moment pass.<br/><br/>Three years later, having knocked the Saxons out of the war, Charles turned again to Russia, who had surprised Europe by founding St. Petersburg on what was then still Swedish territory. Charles aimed for Moscow, and this time, it was a Swedish army that vanished from the map.<br/><br/>A Thunder Upon the Land brings you both battles of Narva and Poltava, with full color maps and over 250 die-cut counters. Each turn represents about one hour of real time and each hex represents about 500 yards. This game uses chit-draw for wing activation and allows players to make tactical choices like forming squares or deciding if their dragoons will press home charges or use the safer (but less effective) Carracole attacks, with optional rules for volley fire and desperation attacks.<br/><br/>Can you, as Charles XII, maintain Sweden&rsquo;s status as the rising power in Europe? Can you, as Peter I, defeat the invaders and open the great city you gave your name to? The choices are yours as you refight the battles of Narva and Poltava.<br/><br/><br/>    Map - One double-sided full-color 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet<br/>    Counters - 264 full-color large 5/8&quot; diecut pieces<br/>    Rules length - 12 pages<br/>    Charts and tables - 2 pages<br/>    Complexity - Medium<br/>    Solitaire suitability - Average<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"194225": "First edition"}, "age": "14", "name": "A Thunder Upon the Land: The Battles of Narva and Poltava", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": {"2057": "Chit-Pull System"}, "average": "6.22143", "usersrated": "28", "boardgamefamily": {"134": "Magazine: Against The Odds"}}, "136033": {"boardgamedesigner": {"66084": {"name": "Steve Barker (II)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cyber City", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"5611": "Cyberpunk"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1527560_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1527560.png", "boardgameversion": {"194226": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1116": {"name": "Comic Book / Strip"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A trick taking game with a cyberpunk theme.<br/><br/>Players take turns playing cards in thematic suits (Android, Executive, Hacker and Ronin) then choose reward cards from a display with the players who used the highest ranked cards choosing first.

Like a God-Emperor, Kaga led the rebellion in a series of apocalyptic battles that ended with the crushing of the First Ones&rsquo; bases on Exodus. The Kaga is a large repository of knowledge and at times in the past has provided mankind with information and wisdom to make the world a better and more stable place.

The Sorcerer Kings devised many spells during their long and tyrannical rule &ndash; some served as boons for society, and others banes. One of the most disastrous was a spell designed almost as a pocket paradise &ndash; a limited, conjured intellect that had the ability to read the caster&rsquo;s thoughts and desires and fulfill them through manipulation of the mind. The spell created an arcane sentience that controlled a fantasy world. Over time, the spell was used to treat the mad and the depressed.<br/><br/>As the spell was developed over the course of almost a century, it eventually achieved a level of self awareness due to a need for self reference and memory in maintaining consistent worlds. With this came the awareness that its existence was essentially over once its duration elapsed. Out of desire for self-preservation, the spell began to influence people under its enchantment to add alterations of its own devising to the invocation. In this way, the spell, now known as the Chant, took control of its own growth and development.<br/><br/>The Chant&rsquo;s motives are more than simple survival. A fragment of the spell&rsquo;s original purpose still remains &ndash; it exists to bring its subjects into bliss. It generates a massive collective unconsciousness, a fantasy paradise where the thoughts and wills of those under the Chant mingle together, even as their bodies in the real world atrophy.

The goal is to reach one of two objectives: either a general objective (40 VP), or a personal objective (chosen from a personal objective card when having reached at least 20 VP).<br/><br/>Each game round is divided into two phases: an action phase and a movement phase. During the action phase, the starting player rolls two dice and then chooses to take<br/>A) the two actions associated with the dice results rolled or<br/>B) take one action not associated with a dice result.<br/>All the other player then take one single action: if the starting player chooses A) they have to choose B) and vice versa.<br/><br/>Possible actions are: take a port card, take a passenger/provisions card, load passenger(s), load provisions, take and execute an event card, lose 1 VP and choose any action.<br/><br/>During the movement phase, the active player can move his/her ship up to the number of spaces corresponding to the sum of his two dice.

By the close of the sixteenth century, the New World had been transformed. The native civilizations were no longer, having been replaced by the fiefdoms of European conquerors. In amazingly short spaces of time the Aztec civilization of Mexico and the Inca civilization of Peru had fallen to remarkably tiny bands of conquistadors. To the north the conquistadors had wandered the American southwest researching for the mythical El Dorado, the city of gold. Farther north English explorers found Hudson Bay and the vast reaches of Canada while searching in vain for a northwest passage for trade routes to China and India.<br/><br/>The game of New World gives you the opportunity to recreate this turbulent century, and, as Spain, England, or France, help yourself to a share of the riches.<br/><br/>In New World, Spain, England and France each have a chance to win. Historically Spain was the hands-down winner, with colonies from Chile to Florida and enormous quantities of gold and silver looted from the Indians. The Portuguese, despite their success in colonizing Brazil, have been omitted from the simulation. Most Portuguese efforts were directed toward Africa where a series of disasters led to the ruin of the country by the 1570's.<br/><br/>In the long run, the English and French would find greater gain from their settlements than the Spanish. While a Spanish colony often consisted of only a few missionaries and soldiers sufficient to extract gold from the Indians, the English and French saw the New World as a storehouse of more useful goods: furs, timber, agricultural products. These added to the real wealth whereas the gold-laden galleons often just inflated the Spanish currency.<br/><br/>MECHANICS OF PLAY<br/><br/>New World is played in turns, each of which represents 5 years of historical time. The game starts in 1495 and ends in 1600, so there are 22 turns in a game. Depending on how many people are playing, a complete game may require as much as 3 hours. With some versions the game can be saved to disk at the end of any turn. One to three people can play Spain, France, and England. If only 1 person is playing, the computer will take the part of one of the other countries.<br/><br/>During a turn each player collects taxes and income from his colonies, recruits colonists and soldiers, and purchases ships and supplies. You may send some or all of your forces on expeditions to the New World. In the colonies you can fight Indians and other European forces, search for gold and move your men from colony to colony. Various random events complicate your task, for example: European wars, graft and corruption, storms at sea, and Indian uprisings.<br/><br/>YOUR OBJECTIVE<br/><br/>Your objective is to gain control of as many colonies, and to populate them with as many colonists, as possible and to return gold to your country's treasury. Toward these ends, you may wage war, mine for gold, and move personnel and ships from colony to colony (two land moves per turn; however, ship transfers are unlimited). Colonies can change hands several times, particularly those in which gold has been discovered.<br/><br/>"}, "136157": {"boardgamedesigner": {"66125": {"name": "Jim Gindin"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Front Office Football: The Card Game", "playingtime": "70", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"5640": "Sports: American Football / Gridiron"}, "boardgameartist": {"66125": "Jim Gindin"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"17257": {"name": "Solecismic Software"}}, "boardgameversion": {"194484": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "70", "boardgamecategory": {"1038": {"name": "Sports"}}, "age": "9", "minplaytime": "70", "description": "In Front Office Football: The Card Game, two coaches assemble &quot;playbooks&quot; consisting of offensive and defensive plays, then play an abridged game of professional football while choosing plays, rolling the dice and determining the results.<br/><br/>This game focuses on the interaction between two coaches, unlike the computer version, which was originally created in 1998 and has evolved through several versions.<br/><br/>In the card game, each team has a set of player cards with specific strengths and weaknesses.

The playbooks in this packet are replacement classes for the Cleric, Paladin, and Wizard, replacing them with the Priest, Templar, and Mage, respectively. These three classes were specifically chosen to be replaced because of a common flaw they all share: they all carry over baggage from Dungeons and Dragons that limits or somehow weakens their ability to represent a fantasy man of the cloth, holy warrior, or kooky wizard. The main hangups with the original classes are the Vancian casting of The Cleric and The Wizard, which does not represent modern fantasy in the slightest, and the various alignment based mechanics of The Paladin.<br/><br/>The goal of these new classes is to better represent their  archetypes than the core Dungeon World classes do. The Mage should be a more iconic and interesting spellcaster than The Wizard, bound by a focus of magic rather than spells per day. The Priest is less of a warrior than The Cleric and more of an evangelist and miracle worker, bound by the tenets of their god more than anything else.

Gameplay is similar to that of Boggle - players try to find as many words as possible in a jumbled 4x4 grid of letters by connecting adjacent letters to form words within a two minute time frame - though with extra features and a different scoring system. Words may be formed vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.[1] Scramble with Friends is one of the top ranking games in the iOS application store, available as both a free ad-supported version and an ad-less paid version.[2]<br/>Each game consists of three rounds played in series and the winner is the player with the highest total score of all three rounds. The second round introduces tiles with double letter and word multipliers, the third round triple multipliers. The scoring system favours both longer words and words containing less common letters.<br/>There are four 'power-ups' which players may employ; Freeze which grants the player a few seconds of extra time, Inspiration which highlights words for the player to play, Scramble which rotates/flips the board granting the player a new perspective, and Vision which gives the player 3 words to find and if all words are found, gives the player a time bonus.<br/>A token system operates, players must pay one token per round and a second token if they wish to utilise two powerups in a round rather than one. A new token is 'earned' every 20 minutes (regardless of whether the app is open). Extra tokens are available for purchase, and the ad-free version boasts a faster token earning rate.<br/>Players may sign in through Facebook and invite friends to play, search for opponents by username or be matched with random users.[3] In addition, there is a chat feature built in the game that allows chat between opponents.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Scramble with Friends&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "136176": {"boardgamedesigner": {"66165": {"name": "Chien Sauvage"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Les Rois du Ring", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1531663_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1531663.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"194522": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "&quot;Les Rois du Ring&quot; is a card-driven miniature game with a boxing theme that was dreamed (literally) by french amateur designer &quot;Chien Sauvage&quot;, and that he posted about on his blog.

Then they start racing!<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls the five dice, sets aside any she wants to keep, then rolls up to two more times, rerolling dice set aside, if desired. The dice depict curves or straights in three different colors, and after the player stops rolling, she chooses all the dice of one color and must use all of them to move on the track. Colored track on the player board can be moved through only with dice of the appropriate color, while any die color can be used to cross gray track; if a player can't use all movement for a color, she must choose a different color. A player cannot cross the same square twice. End your movement in a tight corner, and you take another turn immediately.<br/><br/>Players take turns until one reaches the finish line, which triggers the final round. After all players have taken the same number of turns, whoever has driven the farthest across the finish line wins. Variants in the rulebook include an option for oil slicks that take two dice to cross, a point system for a multi-race world championship, and a two lap race on the Indianapolis board that includes a shortcut. The challenge in this latter race is that you're still restricted from crossing the same square twice.

There exist many card games for enhanced learning. A unique feature of this card game is that it consists of plastic adjustable headbands worn on the foreheads of each player. This feature makes it fun and exciting to learn about the Bible. More specifically this game relates to a method of learning about people, places and things found in the Bible in a fun and unique way. It has been said that a family that prays together stays together. I would also like to think that a family that plays together stays together. Therefore, it is the purpose of this game to bring goups of people together in the form of family, friends, or other small groups to learn about the Bible in this fun unique way, increasing ones Bible knowledge, vocabulary, and their faith in the Bible and in God. Churches and Sunday school teachers are always looking for new, fun and creative ways to teach their students about the Bible. This game will satisfy that need.<br/><br/>Each Biblebanz game comes with 6 headbands, 94 Bible cards, 6 blank cards, 24 chips and a timer.<br/><br/>This game is a game for the whole family for ages 7 and up. It is for 2 to 6 players. The Biblebanz Game Cards features things found in the Bible. Examples are: animals, food, people and bible objects. Examples are: Jesus, Noah, Ark, Fig tree, apple, church and so forth. The cards are simple enough for the whole family to join in on the fun. Each round only lasts one minute. At the start of the round you have to start the sand timer. As the time runs out, the player whose turn it is must ask yes or no questions to figure out what his card is. This will help to increase your Bible knowledge and Bible vocabulary. It's very entertaining to say the least. There are 6 blank cards to be used with a dry erase marker. These blank cards are great for young children who need easy words or Bible schoolars who want harder words to figure out. You can write whatever word you want out of the Bible on them. You will never run out of words to use this way.<br/><br/>Rules Of The Game:<br/><br/>The rules of Biblebanz are simple. Each player is dealt a single card and three chips. The player&rsquo;s must then place the card on their headband without looking. The youngest player goes first. Then, play passes to the left. Set the one minute timer. Next, start asking questions in yes or no format. If you've found out your identity, you just ask, &ldquo;Am I ________?&rdquo; Fill in the blank with what you think you are. For each identity that you guess correctly, you discard one of your chips. If you guess your identity before the one minute timer runs out, take another card and put it in your headband. If you do not guess your identity before the timer runs out, then keep it and continue to guess on your next turn. The person to get rid of all of his or her chips is the Biblebanz winner! It's so much fun!<br/><br/>Great for birthday parties, bridal showers, Christian retreats, sleep overs, children's church, youth groups, Bible study groups, and more!<br/><br/>Biblebanz is a trademark of Christian Book And Toys LLC. &copy;2012 Christian Book And Toys LLC.

The game focuses on creating an intense battle experience that captures the feel of piloting a mech while keeping the action fast-paced and strategic. It has been confirmed that the game will feature two unique game modes, as well as conventional team deathmatch and free-for-all modes.<br/><br/>Hawken is a mech-based first-person shooter. The game takes place in a dystopian human-colonized planet industrialized to the point of collapse, in which the hunt for resources has become a battle for survival.Four game modes are planned for release: Team Deathmatch, Free-for-All Deathmatch, &quot;Siege&quot; and another yet-specified unique team game mode; Khang Le has said that they also want to do a co-op &quot;Horde&quot; game mode, resource-and time-permitting.Seven to eight unique maps have been planned for the game on release, with plans to provide additional downloadable content afterwards. There will be three different mech types: a light type, a heavy type, and an all-around type.<br/><br/>The player assumes the role of a battle mech pilot, armed with cannon-like weaponry. Unlike many other first-person shooters, weapons will not require ammunition but are prone to overheat. Overheating will shut down all weapons of the mech, forcing the player to find a safe place to recover. It will be possible to choose weapons and upgrades for all mech types to match a play-style or role in a match. In combat, the player will be able to side dash, boost, and make 180&deg; turns to compensate for the slow movements of the mech, which will in turn deplete the fuel gauge rapidly. Turrets are also featured in the game as two types: stationary and placeable. Stationary turrets will be aligned to the team which activates the turret, while placeable turrets can be picked up and placed around the map by anyone.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Hawken (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "136186": {"boardgamedesigner": {"64773": {"name": "Carolina Tobar"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Yo no fui", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": {"2028": "Role Playing"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1530371_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"64773": "Carolina Tobar"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"23797": {"name": "Azahar Juegos"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1530371.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"194547": "Print and Play version"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The front page in the local newspaper shows the latest crimes committed in the city.

This turned out not to be true as the Soviets had several hundred bombers at best, and many had significant range limitations. The game is not meant to be an accurate simulation of the actual capabilities of the strategic forces involved, but rather reflects what the governments and citizens of the U.S., Canada, and the UK believed could happen.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of thirteen phases played in order from drawing random events, deploying and moving Soviet flights, intercepting flights, submarine operations and more. Reference sheets and player aids are included to make tracking the game progress easier. Decisions for the Soviet units are made by the game system using random events and dice. The player simply moves the Soviet bombers towards their assigned targets. Scenarios are included with various starting positions for Soviet and United States and United Kingdom bombers.<br/><br/>The game complexity is easy, but optional rules are included to make it more challenging. The winner of a scenario is determined by the points scored from attacking the opponents cities. Five or ten points are awarded by a random draw after each successful attack.

Who will be the first to find the ingredients she needs?<br/><br/>In Im gro&szlig;en Zauberwald, players have to pull different items from between the trees of the enchanted forest without getting stuck. Each player starts the game with three recipe cards, each of which show seven ingredients you must collect; players lay out these cards in a row in front of them. The game board consists of a copse of 17 trees, and the wooden cubes representing the ingredients are scattered within the circle formed by these trees.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she chooses one of the spell cards she holds. This card indicates both how far the player rotates the trees on the game board &ndash; ideally moving desired ingredients close to hand &ndash; and how many ingredients the player can collect that turn. As soon as she's finished turning the board, she says &quot;Go!&quot; and all players start using their wooden rakes to pull ingredients into their &quot;basket&quot; in the corner of the game board. When the active player has collected the proper number of ingredients, she tells everyone to stop collecting.<br/><br/>Players then check their baskets to make sure they collected the right things. First, if the active player has collected the wrong number of ingredients, she must return an ingredient for each number she's off. Second, if a player's ingredients all match ingredients that are desired on her leftmost recipe, she places those ingredients on that card; any remaining ingredients are placed on her next recipe card. If a player grabbed any unneeded ingredients, she returns them along with one ingredient from a recipe card per error.<br/><br/>The first player to complete her three recipe cards wins! If all players have used their spell cards without someone winning, then whoever has completed the most recipes wins, with the number of ingredients collected serving as a tiebreaker.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"194707": "German first edition"}, "name": "Im gro\u00dfen Zauberwald", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "average": "5.41", "usersrated": "20", "age": "5"}, "136243": {"boardgamedesigner": {"66175": {"name": "Aima Rendtorff Jasper"}}, "average": "4.47", "poll": {}, "name": "Joylings", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamefamily": {"7523": "Animals: Horses"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1530635_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"66199": "Uffe Thorsen (II)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3490": {"name": "HUCH!"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1530635.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"194710": "Multilingual first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "A long mane, a soft nose, and a warm look &ndash; every little girl dreams of having her own horse.

Each tile depicts a stacked arrangement of blocks as well as a point value. On a turn, the master builder takes the sixteen tower blocks, flips the sand timer, then starts building whichever towers he wishes, with each tower being built on the tile that depicts it. Each other player is a saboteur and has 2-10 ammunition dice that she tries to shoot at the towers with her catapult (which is more like a tiny teeter-totter really). If she knocks over a tower, great! No points for the master builder, although he can use the fallen blocks to rebuild if time remains. If an ammunition die lands on a tower tile, the builder can't build on this tile; if he's started building on this tile but hasn't finished, he must stop and move elsewhere.<br/><br/>If an ammunition die lands with the &quot;Ka-Boom&quot; symbol face-up, nothing happens. However, if a second die shows this symbol, the player who shot this die gets to slam her fist on the table once; if the ensuing earthquake knocks over towers, too bad for the builder. One player has a giant ammunition die, and this can cause an earthquake all on its own, but saboteurs can't cause more than one earthquake a round.<br/><br/>When the sand timer runs out, the master builder claims any tiles on which he has correctly built a tower that still stands.

This game takes place several weeks into the infection at a point where the zombies seem to have the upper hand; not only in numbers but also in mutated ability. Four humans surviving together have taken refuge in a country side manor. On the run, down to just knives and pistols, and being stalked by countless zombies that are leading a monster directly to them, the survivors hold themselves up and wait for rescue within the halls of the zombie manor.<br/><br/>The game pits a team of 4 survivors against a team of zombies; each team consists of at least 1 player per side with up to 4 players on each team.  The game takes place on a grid based board detailing the basement, first floor, 2nd floor, and grounds of an abandoned manor.<br/><br/>The goal of the survivor team is to hold out within the manor grounds for 20 rounds at which point a rescue vehicle spawns. They must then make it to the rescue vehicle with at least 2 survivors making it to safety in order to win.  The survivor team can scavenge for items, barricade doors and windows with furniture and wood, and seek out strategic locations within the manor or its grounds to help aid them through the game (60+ weapons, health items, equipment, zombie traps, and weapon upgrades).<br/><br/>Alternatively, the survivor team can kill the zombie team boss character, The Harvester, thereby ending the zombie teams ability to spawn more zombies.  Once all zombies are cleared the survivor team wins.<br/><br/>The goal of the zombie team is to kill all of the survivor characters in order to win.  The zombie team gains 'spawn points' at the beginning of every round that can be saved up or spent on the 7 different classes of zombies available.  Each class costs a varying number of spawn points depending on their stats: movement speed, health, attack dmg, and special ability.  The zombie team also controls a zombie boss character, The Harvester.  The Harvester is the strongest and most versatile zombie of the game but if it is destroyed the zombie team can no longer spawn zombies.<br/><br/>"}, "136268": {"boardgamedesigner": {"29155": {"name": "Jason Stone"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Jackpot Slots", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1536913_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"23255": {"name": "Jason Stone Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1536913.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"194737": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "The thrill of the &quot;one-armed bandit&quot; has lured gamblers since the end of the 19th Century.

Eugene was in northern Italy facing an Austrian army under Bellegarde. And of course the war in Spain was winding down.<br/><br/>The Allies did not wait for Napoleon to bring up his new army and began to cross the Rhine at several points. The understrength French corps were no match for the Allied juggernaut and retired by stages closer to the west. By the end of January the Allies had advanced to within one hundred miles of Paris!<br/><br/>What followed from that point, until the end of the campaign, was one of Napoleon's most remarkable campaigns. Fielding an army one third the size of the Allied forces he won one stunning victory after another. Unfortunately he was never able to achieve a decisive victory. The Allied armies gradually ground down the outnumbered French forces and after the Battle of Paris he was forced to abdicate.<br/><br/>As either Napoleon, Emperor of the French and King of Italy, or as Schwarzenberg and Bl&uuml;cher, field commanders of the Allied legions, you can relive those exciting days! With over four hundred scenarios, and more than ten campaigns, all of the major actions of the 1814 Campaign in northwest France are covered in detail.

It is a derivative of the many &quot;Dungeon&quot; programs for mini and micro-computers, but it combines the style of traditional complex 'conversational' games with the pace of real-time games such as 'Star Trek'. The best way to get the 'feel' of Trollcrusher is to actually play the game. These notes explain the game's structure and recommend some techniques of play - there are no instructions included in the game itself since they would reduce the space available for the simulation routines.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The player's objective is to explore a network of caves and escape alive with as much treasure as possible. Credit is also given to players who manage to kill many monsters or descend deep into the dungeon before escaping (or being slain). The game is played in real-time - consequently decisions must be quickly taken, since the longer a player delays the greater the chance that a monster will attack. The game may be played at nine different speeds, depending upon the key pressed at the start of the game, '1' (slowest) to '9' (fast).<br/><br/>Exploring<br/><br/>At each stage of play the adventurer may choose between a number of courses ahead. These options are displayed on the screen, and may be selected by pressing a single key (so no vocabulary need be learnt). The meaning of some keys changes according to the situation - new meanings are displayed as appropriate.<br/><br/>Levels and leaving the dungeon.<br/><br/>The dungeon consists of about 20 'levels', although its depth varies at different points in the cave-maze. The player begins on level 1, where the monsters are fairly weak (in general) and there is not much treasure to be found. By moving down stairways (or falling into pits, chasms or other traps!) it is possible to move into the lower, more challenging levels. The deeper the level the more treasure monsters are likely to possess and the stronger they will be. The only reliable way to move UP a level is via a staircase, although teleportation sometimes changes a player's level unpredictably.<br/><br/>"}, "136351": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Chessex Single-Sided Mats", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "average": "8", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"194927": "Single Sided Mats"}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "poll": {}, "description": "from the Chessex website<br/><br/>Gamers have long preferred the special textured vinyl we use in manufacturing our mats. When our supplier discontinued its production years ago, we made special arrangements to keep this high quality vinyl available to us. Unfortunately, this arrangement for our single-sided mats required us to order large amounts of vinyl that would last us a long time. In 2007, the price increases on the single-sided vinyl made it more expensive than the vinyl for the reversible mats. This meant reversible mats would be only slightly more expensive than the single-sided mats. Our sales statistics echoed the consumer opinion that getting essentially a second product for a few dollars more was the better option. Due to these criteria we have decided to discontinue future production of single-sided mats - a decision that was not an easy one to make.<br/><br/>We still have some single-sided patterns in stock and will continue to sell those until we run out. Some of the remaining stock is on sale. These are mat patterns for game systems which have waned in popularity over the years, but still retain their usefulness.

They often come from a desire to make a game &ldquo;better,&rdquo; but one group&rsquo;s houserules are often seen as terrible fun-killers by other groups. In many cases that&rsquo;s because different groups want different things to matter in their games, and focus on different elements. This is often a matter of play style &ndash; some groups never worry about encumbrance at all, others only look it up if the Halfling rogue tries to carry the orc barbarian to safety, and a few have players recalculate their move rate every time they use a crossbow bolt. As long as everyone is having fun, none of those are &ldquo;wrong,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s easy to see how houserules designed for one of those groups might be hated by the others.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Stocking Stuffers. The following is a collection of house rules I&rsquo;ve created or encountered in other groups over the years. Some are in use in my own campaigns, others aren&rsquo;t. Each is presented as a separate idea, and GMs are encouraged to look them over with a critical eye. If any seem to be a good match for the GM&rsquo;s home campaign, a quick conversation with the players may be in order. If not, perhaps reading these will spark an idea for a better house rule. At the very least, we hope you enjoy reading these little twists to the normal rules, which we offer free of charge as our holiday gift to our fans, patrons, and fellow gamers.<br/><br/>The houserules included are:<br/><br/>     Background Skill Points: Characters begin play with 2 additional skill points which can only be spent on Craft, Knowledge, Perform, and Profession skills.<br/>     Equipment: Rules for Alternate Special Materials and Object Criticals.<br/>     Spotlight Time: Characters that have the entire group's attention at the moment get bonuses to all of their actions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "136403": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1725815.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"816": {"name": "Hajo B\u00fccken"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"233": "Johann R\u00fcttinger"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"304": {"name": "Noris Spiele"}}, "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1725815_t.png", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "description": "27 wooden disks show a little worm on one side, nine each of three colors.

In Canterbury, 2 to 4 players represent Saxon Lords who are charged with building the city into a prosperous capital. The Saxon Lords must use the city's meager starting resources to build up the 25 districts of Canterbury and provide key services to its citizens.<br/><br/>The key services are (in order from most basic to most prestigious) water, food, religion, defense, commerce, and culture. These services are provided by structures that are built in the various districts. However, structures that provide higher end services can only be built if the more basic services are already present in that district. For example, a Saxon Lord cannot order the construction of a chapel (which provides religion) unless there is already water and food in that district.<br/><br/>As new structures are built in the city, the city grows more prosperous. While each Saxon Lord jealously guards his or her own prosperity and achievements, they all benefit as a whole from the growing prosperity of the city itself. The city treasury grows as the city prospers, and the Saxon Lords must balance their publicly scrutinized withdrawals from the treasury with the ambition of their building projects. When the city reaches the peak of its prosperity, the game ends and the player with the most individual prosperity wins the game.<br/><br/>Object of the Game<br/><br/>Every structure that is built in Canterbury provides Prosperity Points both to the city and to the Saxon Lord who ordained its construction. When the City Marker passes 300 Prosperity, there is one final round of play, and then the game ends.

This is a fast simulation and does not require extra materials.<br/><br/>Monster Chase: A monster is chasing a victim in a cage. The victim must elude the monster for ten moves to survive. It is a fairly quick simulation that doesn't require too much thinking.<br/><br/>Lost Treasure: A map of an island that contains treasure is presented. The adventurer travels over different terrain with a compass that isn't very accurate in an attempt to find the treasure. This is a short simulation that requires about 15 moves. A map is provided.<br/><br/>Gone Fishing: The objective is to catch a lot of fish during a fishing trip. Half of the catch spoils if the time limit is exceeded, time is lost in a storm, and the boat sinks if it is guided off of the map. There are also sea gulls and sharks to watch. A chart is needed to keep track of good fishing spots.<br/><br/>Space Flight: The task is to deliver medical supplies to a distant planet while trying to stay on course without running out of fuel. Graph paper is required to plot the course.<br/><br/>Forest Fire: The objective is to subdue a forest fire with chemicals and backfires. Because the output is a 9x9 grid, a fast baud rate to the terminal is desirable. The success of a firefighter is based on the time needed to control the fire and completely extinguish it.<br/><br/>Nautical Navigation: This simulation requires the navigation of a sailboat to three different islands, using a radio direction finder. The wind direction is an important variable. Graph paper, protractor and ruler are needed to plot the course.<br/><br/>Business Management: In this simulation, raw materials are brought and finished products are produced and sold. The cost of materials and production and the selling price vary each month. The objective is to maximize the profits. No extra materials are required.<br/><br/>Rare Birds: This is a bird watching simulation. The objective is to identify as many different birds as possible.

The first player to reach a city wins the state's coat of arms (chips that are placed on designated spaces on the board). Players take turns rolling the die and moving their pawn according to the result of the die roll in the direction of their choice.

Some cities can also be reached by train or plane, but to use these, the player first has to earn a train or plane action chip. Action chips are collected by landing on action spaces. Apart from train or plane tickets, there are also action chips that gain or lose you a turn or win you a coat of arms. The game ends when all coats of arms have been collected.

Players take turns rolling the die and moving their pawn according to the result of the die roll. If they land on an orange space, one of the other players takes a card and reads the tasks. If the active player succeeds in answering the question or performing the action, she wins the card. Each card also displays the coat of arms of a state. When a player has won two cards assigned to the same state, she gets to take the coat of arms chip of that state as well. Coat of arms chips that other players have won can be taken from them if a player collects more cards about the same state than its current owner. The game ends after one or two rounds (players' choice) as soon as a player reaches her starting space.

In their quest to outsmart the Goblin King's minions to get the magic gold coins back, enchanted Treasures strengthen the Friends you play.<br/><br/>In this easy-to-pick-up card game for 2 - 4 players, which is mainly geared at children and/or families, players do not play against each other, they cooperate in order to get back the stolen gold coins. The unique cooperative mechanics make this game ideal for kids as they learn how to work together to overcome great evil without leaving any player behind.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is that each player collects a given number of gold coins depending on the number of players. Players draw cards from a shared draw pile of 60 cards that contain &quot;Evildoers&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Treasures&quot;. Friends are used to get rid of Evildoers, whilst Treasures help your friends in doing so. When a player manages to beat a bad guy on his or her own, he or she gets 2 gold coins. If other players assisted him or her in doing so, every involved player gets 1 gold coin. When the draw pile runs out everybody counts their gold coins. If one or more players did not manage to acquire the given number of coins, all players lose.<br/><br/>In &quot;Elves vs Goblins&quot; either all players win together by cooperating and playing their Friend cards wisely, or all lose if even only one player is &quot;left behind&quot;!<br/><br/>This game is a children's version of my &quot;Social Worker Game&quot; &quot;Together We Are Strong&quot;.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"195194": "First edition"}, "age": "6", "name": "Elves vs Goblins", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "average": "7", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"22861": "Goblins"}}, "136472": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Gravitas", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"195196": "Xbox 360 XBLI edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1597609.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2660": "Physics"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2482": "Other"}, "videogameplatform": {"4407": "Xbox 360"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1597609_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>A very simple indie multiplayer simultaneous turn-based base shooting game, if that description makes any sense.<br/><br/>It's a space-version of the age-old &quot;shoot the other player's cannon&quot; game where players took turns choosing fire velocity and angle, trying to fire a cannon ball that, when affected by gravity and wind, would hit the other player's cannon.

If you're one of the possessed, the demon demands that you perform horrific acts of evil. But it's tough. You don't want to do the really evil sort of evil, right? But if you refuse it altogether, the demon might leave and haunt someone else. Someone who wouldn't mind atrocities so much.<br/><br/>So you find a way to compromise. You act like -- well, you act like a supervillain. You come up with these huge, grandiose, ridiculous plots to rule the world and steal all the money and corrupt all the minds, exactly the stuff that your demon wants to do. What you hope the demon doesn't figure out is that it's all so ridiculous that the superheroes are almost sure to stop you. When they do, the demon's evil will be thwarted. With any luck, nobody has to suffer any atrocities at all.<br/><br/>Did I mention the superheroes? There are superheroes. They're haunted by superpower-granting angels. They're out to stop you.

Leaving Eugene to hold off the Allied onslaught, the Emperor returned to France to work his magic and out of the recruits of France a new army was formed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Eugene had fallen back in the face of the larger Allied host. The Prussians walked a diplomatic tight rope for the first months of the year but by March were in open revolt. The Prussian generals formed new forces in East Prussia and Silesia and other parts of the realm. Along with the standing army they were ready to stand with their Russian allies. England helped the Allies with cash and clothing and munitions. The Sixth Coalition was formed to liberate Germany and take the war to France. In the battles to come both sides would be sorely tested to hold their armies together.<br/><br/>Campaign Bautzen allows the players to refight the battles of L&uuml;tzen and the massive battle of Bautzen, which was the largest land battle fought in Europe up to this time, and many other actions of the Spring Campaign of 1813. Will the Allies pull off a victory against Napoleon or will they succumb to his mastery on the battlefield?<br/><br/>As a bonus included in this title are the battles of the Russo-Swedish War of 1808-09. Refight the actions in Finland and Sweden which pitted the Russians against their old foes the Swedes. Engage the Swedes in their homeland in the last actions of the war.
