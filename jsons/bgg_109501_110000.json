Defined broadly, magic implements are handheld devices that assist spellcasters with their casting in much the same way magic weapons assist characters in combat. Wyrd wands give casters enhancement bonuses to caster level checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, and possibly one other area, while rune staves can grant bonuses to a wide range of spell-related effects. Both are assumed to have arcane writing built into them (called &quot;wyrds&quot; or &quot;runes,&quot; depending on which implement they are scribed on) that allow them to enhance every spell cast by their wielders, rather than being spells-in-a-can that take over when a spellcaster is out of other options.<br/><br/>"}, "109504": {"rpgartist": ["Lin Bo", "M\u00e1rton Gyula Kiss"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Extra Evolutions", "rpgdesigner": ["Owen K.C.

Aladdin and his genie, the king and the witch Zoulvisia, the tale of the genie of the bronze ring (from The Blue Fairy Book by Andrew Lang), and even the tall tales of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Big Blue Ox can all serve as templates for how players can play summoners, and how they might be seen by societies within a campaign world.<br/><br/>Because a summoner's eidolon can take many forms, you can use the class to represent a wide range of character types. If the eidolon takes the form of an incubus or succubus, the summoner becomes a diabolist. If it takes the form of a dragon, the summoner becomes a dragon rider. If it takes the form of a primal nature spirit, the summoner is a shaman. If the eidolon is a formless mass of horrific, shapeless flesh, the summoner becomes an alienist working with powers beyond his comprehension.<br/><br/>We could present many more types of summoner and eidolon than any one or two books has room to offer, especially since most game supplements have to appeal to a broad range of interests. The Advanced Player's Guide lacks room to present more than the most basic eidolon abilities, and Ultimate Magic logically must focus on the most popular magic-using classes. The summoner and his eidolon benefit greatly from additional options, each expanding the kinds of characters that can be created from one class, but such options are of necessity interesting only to players of that single class, and they take up a lot of room.<br/><br/>To help in that regard, Advanced Options: Extra Evolutions presents two new base forms (the hut and the ooze) and thirty-eight new evolutions. The evolutions focus on 1- and 2-point evolutions, and many provide additional color that adds to an eidolon's build. With these new options, an eidolon can become a brass elephant with a built-in howdah, a horrific mass of shifting flesh, or a legendary animal spirit that can draw on any of nature's natural defenses.<br/><br/>"}, "109505": {"poll": [], "name": "Echelon", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Amnesty Visual"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Arena Games"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Ring World.

It's flexible enough to adapt to any roleplaying game on the market, and expansive enough to keep up with the most intricate of rules systems.<br/><br/>Hero Lab presents a wealth of highly detailed information in a manner that is easy to navigate and intuitive to use. Through the use of adaptive summary panels, all the inter-dependencies of your character are readily visible. Mouse-sensitive help keeps all the details at your disposal without cluttering up the screen.<br/><br/>Hero Lab manages the complex inter-connections of your character automatically and transparently, so you&rsquo;re free to experiment. As you make changes to your character, Hero Lab automatically applies appropriate bonuses, penalties, and modifiers, immediately showing you the results of those changes. Don&rsquo;t like what your changes did? Try something different. Similarly, if you step outside of the defined rules for the game, the validation engine will automatically alert you to the situation, telling you where the problem lies. The validation engine alerts you to the error without directly enforcing correct behavior - this allows you to ignore the error, making it easy to accomodate house rules.<br/><br/>Characters aren't just about numbers and choices, however. Every character is a story in the telling &ndash; how they came to be, who they are, and their hopes for the future. With an innovative journaling option, Hero Lab gives you the ability to track key events in your character's life, and the comprehensive In-Play mode allows you to easily manage your character during the game, from applying temporary effects (from spells, abilities, etc.) to tracking limited use items (such as arrows, potions and the like), to activating special abilities (such as Barbarian Rage).<br/>Games Supported<br/><br/>Hero Lab allows you to create, manage and evolve characters for the following game systems:<br/><br/>* Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (Paizo Publishing)<br/>    * Mutants &amp; Masterminds, 2nd and 3rd editions (Green Ronin Publishing)<br/>    * d20 System SRD 3.5 (Wizards of the Coast)<br/>    * World of Darkness (White Wolf Publishing)<br/>    * 4th Edition D&amp;D (included with the Authoring Kit - Wizards of the Coast)<br/>    * Savage Worlds (included with the Authoring Kit - Pinnacle Entertainment Group)<br/>    * Authoring Kit (create your own games using Hero Lab's powerful scripting engine)<br/><br/>Support for additional game systems will be added in the following months, under license from their publishers.<br/>Data Files<br/><br/>Hero Lab can be tailored to the needs of virtually any game system. All of the facets of a given game system are encapsulated by a set of data files, spanning the core game mechanics to the validation rules, and even the visual presentation of Hero Lab&rsquo;s display.<br/><br/>When you purchase Hero Lab, it comes &ldquo;bundled&rdquo; with one game system of your choice (from the list above). Access to additional data files can be purchased for a nominal charge. The list of supported games can be found here.<br/>Editing Tools<br/><br/>Hero Lab offers a powerful Editor within each system which allows users to customize existing data files and create new data files. This Editor makes it possible for users to create a huge variety of custom content, or to simply make minor adjustments to accommodate house rules.<br/>GM Support<br/><br/>Hero Lab can help GMs as well as players - it now includes hundreds of stock heroes, which can be imported as &quot;instant NPCs&quot; for use in your games. Once you've imported the NPCs into Hero Lab, you can manage combat and noncombat encounters in the Tactical Console.<br/><br/>Out of combat, the Tactical Console displays skill information for all heroes. In combat, it shows attack information, as well as important saving throws and other statistics. You can apply damage or status conditions to any hero with the click of a button.<br/><br/>"}, "109535": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114442.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Larry Winslow"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["Critical Hit, Inc."], "maxplaytime": "180", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1114442_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "From the Critical Hit webpage:<br/><br/>Welcome to the ATS ON THE ROAD TO BATAAN, a historical module that depicts the fierce fighting for the Abucay/Mabatang Line from 11-15 January, 1942.

The cavalier class is flexible and customizable through the use of cavalier orders&mdash;a themed focus for the character built around the ideas of a chivalric order. The Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide presents six possible orders, each granting the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities, as well as a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow.<br/><br/>The orders detailed in the Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide are interesting, well balanced, and cover some of the most common tropes in which a cavalier&rsquo;s player is likely to be interested. However, compared to the number of clerical domains or sorcerer bloodlines, six is a tiny sample of possible options for cavalier customization. To help expand this list Advanced Options: Cavaliers&rsquo; Orders presented six additional orders from which the cavalier could choose. Since more choice is almost always a good thing, Advanced Options: More Cavalier Orders presents even more new cavalier orders! Although these two books work well together, nothing in them overlaps, and players do not need the original Cavaliers&rsquo; Orders to use everything in More Cavalier Orders.<br/><br/>A GM who wants to add new cavalier orders to a campaign has numerous options. The easiest method is to assume that these orders have always existed. If the players and/or GM want more verisimilitude in the campaign world, perhaps these could represent brand new orders that have only recently come into prominence. Alternatively, these orders might have existed for quite some time, but were previously unknown to the PCs. Perhaps an order might have originated in a different part of the campaign world and has only recently become active in the PCs&rsquo; part of the world.<br/><br/>The seven new cavalier orders presented herein are as follows.<br/><br/><br/>    Order of the Bow: A cavalier who belongs to this order is dedicated to mastering the bow and mounted archery in particular. Cavaliers of this order see perfection in archery as an outward manifestation of inner perfection.<br/>    Order of the Citadel: Cavaliers who join the order of the citadel dedicate their lives to the ideals of teamwork, bravery, and valor in combat. Cavaliers of the citadel are often seen as the ultimate soldiers, willing to give and obey difficult orders and lay down their lives in the performance of their duty.<br/>    Order of the Raven: Grim enforcers of their lord&rsquo;s safety and lawbound servants of that lord&rsquo;s will, cavaliers of the order of the raven wrap themselves in dark colors to enhance their function as warnings to those who would oppose them. To members of this order, a harsh appearance and gruesome reputation are as effective as a sharp sword and swift lance charge.<br/>    Order of the Shroud: A cavalier who belongs to this mysterious order is dedicated to hunting down and destroying undead. Cavaliers of the shroud see life and death as a natural cycle, and undead are a vile and unnatural violation of that cycle. Although a few cavaliers of the shroud recognize that not all undead are evil, the majority see little distinction and are more than willing to destroy neutral and good undead along with the evil ones.<br/>    Order of the Trident: Cavaliers belonging to this order frequently come from aquatic races such as sea elves, tritons, merfolk, locathah, and sahuagin. Cavaliers of the trident are dedicated to the pursuit of various goals pertaining to the sea. However, like the sea, those goals can be wildly different and ever changing. Some cavaliers of the trident nobly dedicate themselves to protecting the creatures of the sea while others selfishly work to plunder and exploit the sea&rsquo;s vast resources.<br/>    Order of the Unicorn: Cavaliers who belong to this order are staunch protectors of nature. The order is open only to females of exceptionally pure virtue. Cavaliers of the unicorn are great enemies of evil and particularly seek out those who harm animals or damage the local ecosystem unnecessarily. Order of the Wolf: This order is most often taken by the champions and legendary warriors of less civilized clans and tribes, especially orc and half-orcs. The order of the wolf cavalier is a fierce defender and supporter of the clan, working to further its best interests regardless of what others think of the cavalier&rsquo;s actions.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "109558": {"rpgartist": ["Tom Floyd", "Chuck Lukacs", "OtherWorld Creations", "Kieran Yanner"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "The Enforcer", "rpgdesigner": ["Owen K.C.

The enforcer is trained and skilled at using force to take control of dangerous situations, remain calm under fire, follow a set of rules of engagement, and within those rules adapt and overcome unforeseen obstacles as necessary to achieve victory. The enforcer represents the infantryman, marine, and special forces of the era of modern firearms, and is as adept with tools of personal combat as most modern folk are with a television remote. The weapons used by such warriors vary, depending on the era an enforcer comes from, and they might be as primitive as single-action revolvers and bolt-action rifles, or as complex as assault rifles with laser targeting sights.<br/><br/>And sometimes they end up in fantasy lands, where they are attacked by orcs and need to defend themselves with spears.<br/><br/>The &quot;modern&quot; combatant being stuck in a more primitive, fantasy-themed world is a common trope in a great deal of adventure fiction, especially the &quot;planetary romances&quot; more common in the early part of the 20th century than today, but still very popular with a wide range of gamers (and game writers). The enforcer is the first in a line of Anachronistic Adventurers products designed to provide rules for running modern (or near-modern) heroes in a typical fantasy roleplaying game setting. While it's impossible to address every possible issue that might arise for such characters (does a wish spell restore the function of a cell phone?), each product in the line will look at one area where the modern and fantasy realms are most likely to overlap and give guidance for running heroic anachronisms.

A deck of random event cards adds a random element, &quot;Dallas Press Events,&quot; to each turn (making the game different from the original Cartel).<br/><br/>The winner is the player that acquires the highest net worth, adding together current cash plus the value of their network of companies, less the cost of repaying their debt.<br/><br/>While the game has a theme based on the popular TV shows, only the companies, e.g., Ewing Oil, appear in the game.

If nobody has conquered the world by the end of the 4th turn to win immediately, the player whose empire got the largest at any given point wins.<br/><br/>Each card can be played in one of 3 ways: Generals allow you to place a pawn in that card's territory to be used for rerolls in combats in or adjacent to the territory.  Playing cards as agents gives you one time effects that reflect that historical figure's abilities (Stalin assassinates, Victoria adds an extra die on a naval attack).  Playing cards as rulers gives you their ability for the duration of your turn and sets a goal that reaching it will net you a power bonus at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>At the start of your turn, you're issued a number of tokens.  This number escalates by one during each player turn to ramp up the epic nature of the game.  You also get the bonus when somebody plays a ruler (including you) in one of your territories, and you'll get it at the end of your turn if you reach your ruler's goals. Tokens convert into armies controlling territories in successful attacks and are spent to pay for failed attacks and sea attacks as a Supply Cost.  Each time you pay the Supply Cost, it escalates.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay Details<br/><br/>On your turn, you campaign by throwing one die for each territory you control adjacent to a target territory. The defender throws one die for their defending army plus another for each adjacent territory they control. The highest die wins. Losses and Naval attacks have an escalating Supply Cost. When you are unwilling or unable to pay the Supply cost, your turn ends. Make it count, though, because you only get four turns.<br/><br/>Strategic depth is layered onto this simple system by the deck of conqueror cards. Each historical figure has special powers based on their history, such as Erik the Red making unsupplied naval attacks, or Stalin using assassination to eliminate enemies. The cards may be played as your empire's ruler (which makes their power last your whole turn), a local agent (which gives you the power just once), or a general (which ignores their power but gives you combat rerolls). Ruler cards also have a strategic goal, such as Elizabeth's &ldquo;No one else controls a continent&rdquo; or Caesar's &ldquo;Win 5 attacks.&rdquo; Fulfilling these goals gets you a power bonus at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>In the grand tradition of global conquest games, World Conquerors is epic in scope, but it addresses the genre's traditional shortcomings.<br/><br/><br/>     Short Play Time - just four turns per player each game. It plays in about an hour. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     No Player Elimination - each turn you get a new ruler, regardless of the last one's fate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Quick combat resolution - one army per territory makes battles quick and easy, focusing strategy on card play instead of mass dicefests. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Reduced Kingmaking and Spoiling - ruler goals drive the action leaving little room for spite. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     No Hopeless Positions - supply is based on both time and territory, so it's possible to rebuild a shattered empire from no territories at all.

Adam Warlock calls upon Earth's greatest super heroes to seek out the Infinity Gems before they fall into the wrong hands. In a series, the game is considered a spiritual sequel to X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse. This game is not related in any way to the arcade game Marvel Super Heroes, despite the similar premise and the fact that Capcom published and developed both games. However, Capcom in fact recycled some of the sprites to make the fighting arcade game. Examples of that are the character portraits of Spider-Man, Captain America and Iron Man in the Select Screen, along with Blackheart and Dr. Doom battle sprites.<br/><br/>The player plays each level as one of five superheroes - Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Wolverine, or Hulk - as they battle through various locations around the globe and even outer space. Each character's health bar is separate and carries over between missions - healing can only be done by picking up items in the levels or using healing items picked up during missions. When a character falls, they must be revived individually with the appropriate item.<br/><br/>After investigating an area, the player may or may not be rewarded with one of the gem resulting in a restart of the entire game. Only two can be picked up during the first four missions, one is picked up in the following mission, and then two more are randomly received in two of the four following levels. The last gem is only received upon defeating Thanos, thus completing the game.<br/><br/>A special level in the game is The Avengers Mansion where you can practice fighting certain bosses of the game. Sometimes, you will be rewarded with an item for succeeding.<br/><br/>Each character can also execute special attacks with command input similar to fighting games, but slightly simplified.<br/><br/>The playable heroes:<br/><br/><br/>     Captain America: Balanced in both attack and speed.<br/><br/><br/>Shield Throw: Forward, Forward, Y (Side Throw) OR Up, Up, Y (Upward Throw) OR Down, Down, Y (Downward Throw)<br/>    Shield Charge: Down, Forward, Y (Charges horizontally with his shield at front)<br/>    Air Combo: Y, Y, Y in Air (Kicks enemies thrice in air)<br/><br/><br/>     Iron Man: Powerful but quite slow, can use a variety of projectiles and also has double jump.<br/><br/><br/>Repulsor Beam: Down, Forward, Y (Charges a beam that travels horizontally and knockbacks enemies - can also be used in air)<br/>    Shoulder Grenade: Down, Down, Y (Ducks and fires a single grenade downwards that has a small explosion radius)<br/>    Flying Uppercut: Up+Y (Boosts upwards with a flying uppercut, causing multiple hits)<br/>    Body Slam: Forward, Forward, Y in Air (Charges forward while flying, causing multiple hits)<br/>    Air Combo: Y, Y, Y in Air (Punches the enemy twice and fires a beam downwards)<br/><br/><br/>     Hulk: The biggest character in the game, being the strongest and also the slowest.<br/><br/><br/>Gamma Charge: Forward, Forward, Y (Charges forward with a headbutt)<br/>    Flying Slam: Down, Forward, Y (Punches upwards and jump with an overhead attack)<br/><br/><br/>     Spider-Man: Very agile, but also the weakest character in terms of attack power.

It was released in 1998[1] and was the last game ever released for the Master System. It was rated for all ages, aimed toward younger children, and was designed for only one player. The design is simplistic as Mickey can only perform three things: walking, jumping, and going through doors. There are five major challenges, a segue, and a final challenge. It has met with mixed reviews from gaming magazines.<br/><br/>One Night, Mickey was laying in bed reading a book of Fairy Tales. He thought to himself how wonderful it would be to live on a Far Away Land in a magical castle. All of a sudden, Mickey falls asleep and dreams that he learns of trouble in Beanswick. There is a strange rumbling over the castle and no one can explain it. Mickey (or Minnie) volunteers to investigate. He must go through a series of challenges in various rooms of the castle in order to collect magic beans and items.<br/><br/>Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game where players must complete challenges to beat the game. Players must go through a series of challenges in various rooms of the castle in order to collect magic beans and items.<br/><br/>In Sorting Books, Books are floating up and down in the library of the Beanswick castle and Mickey must sort them in alphabetical order by jumping on them. Depending on difficulty, there are various numbers of books to be sorted and different patterns for the books to float in. Only a portion of the alphabet must be sorted. Once the books have been sorted, players receive an item from Horace Horsecollar. In Moving Potions, Mickey is transformed into a tiny size and placed on a chess-like game board. Potion bottles are on this board, as well as block obstacles that must be maneuvered around. The potion bottles are to be pushed into a magic mirror on the board. In harder difficulty games, there are more boards to play in increasing difficulty. Once all potions have been collected, you return to normal size and receive your item from Donald Duck (dressed like a wizard). Picture Matching is a timed, memory challenge. Mickey must dust off portraits hanging on the castle walls in matching pairs. Basically, it's the matching card game. He must complete this task before the lights in the castle dim to darkness. Depending on difficulty, there are more or less pictures. For challenges with more pictures, more time is given. He is armed with a feather duster and sliding ladder. Match up all the pictures before time and light run out to receive item from Daisy Duck as a princess. Playing the Pipes is another memory game. Several pipes light up and make different noises in a pattern that builds every turn. Mickey must listen, remember, and repeat what he heard. He can do this by jumping on the top of the pipes and playing the notes back in the proper order. The pipes only play one melody, adding one note after every time Mickey successfully completes the previous one. Difficulty of game play determines the length of the melody. Players must play all the right pipes to receive the item from Huey, Dewey, and Louie. In Guess the Tools, Goofy wants Mickey to guess what tools are in his toolbox. Mickey has seven attempts to successfully guess the tools and their order inside Goofy's toolbox. After each guess, a clue appears telling players how many and which tools you guessed in the correct order. In easier games, the tools turn red or green to denote correctness. In more difficult games, a small quartered square of red and green pieces tells Mickey which ones are right. Players must correctly guess what is in Goofy's toolbox to earn an item from Goofy.<br/><br/>Exchanging Itemsis the segue of the game. The items Mickey collected were of no importance to their previous owners, but would serve useful to others in Beanswick. Mickey must go back to all of the others in each challenge and give them the item that suits them. In return for each correctly placed item, Mickey receives a magic bean. Only after retrieving all five beans can Mickey use them. After returning the items to their respective owners, Mickey visits the well. The annoying rumbling occurs again and Mickey throws his beans near the well. Suddenly, a giant beanstalk grows straight up into the clouds. A curious Mickey climbs the beanstalk into the clouds and encounters a giant. The giant is sound asleep and snoring. This massive snoring is the cause of all the trouble for Beanswick. There is a scrambled picture of an alarm clock floating next to the giant. Mickey must unscramble the picture by sliding the pieces and wake up the giant. After Mickey wakes up and talks to the giant, the troubles in Beanswick are solved.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mickey's Ultimate Challenge&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "109676": {"poll": [], "name": "MLBPA Baseball", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Super Famicom edition", "North American SNES edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Baseball"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["High Score Productions", "Visual Concepts Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Coconuts Japan", "EA Sports"], "description": "MLBPA Baseball, or Fighting Baseball (\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb Faitingu Besuboru, &quot;Fighting Baseball&quot;) as it is known in Japan, was a sports game for the Super NES, Mega Drive/Genesis, and Game Gear.<br/><br/>It was one of the first console games to feature Major League Baseball player names and statistics. Its American version was published by EA Sports. The game included the 1993 season's major league players and stats thanks to its MLBPA license, but could not use team names for lack of an MLB license. The game got around this by using the city names of each team with matching colors, and using terms &quot;A League&quot;, &quot;N League&quot;, and &quot;The Series&quot;. Players are allowed to play a single game (with the default teams being Philadelphia at Toronto, the 1993 league champs), a full season based on the 1994 schedule (with wins and losses recorded by password in the SNES version, battery back-up for Genesis), playoffs, and a World Series. Though the full season mode is based on the 1994 schedule, it does NOT include the new (and current) three divisions/wild card format introduced for the 1994 season; instead it uses the old two division (per league) format.<br/><br/>Couched in what the packaging billed as &quot;huge arcade style graphics,&quot; games could be played on either natural or artificial grass (depending on the home team) during day or night. The game also featured scoreboard animations for double and triple plays, home runs, grand slams, pitching changes, pinch hitters, and sometimes strike outs. There were also several cheat codes to alter the game play. These included &quot;RBBR,&quot; which made the ball bounce extraordinarily high, and &quot;BRRR,&quot; which eliminated friction when the ball was in contact with the field. Under ZSNES, the game tends to freeze at random spots in the game (a similar effect occurs in the NHL series and the Madden series). The audience sound is muffled by limitations of the 16-bit sound engine of the Super Famicom.<br/><br/>The SNES version is the first ever baseball video game to include the Atlanta Braves' distinctive Tomahawk Chop theme song, which is actually advertised on the back of the game box.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;MLBPA Baseball&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "109677": {"poll": [], "name": "Mohawk & Headphone Jack", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European SNES edition", "North American SNES edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Music"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Solid Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Black Pearl", "THQ"], "description": "Mohawk &amp; Headphone Jack is a 1996 2D rotational game released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.<br/><br/>The game was developed by Solid Software, published by THQ and distributed by Electro Source.

Originally, every character had a specific win quote for each defeated foe, but that was reduced to only one win quote for each character in the English version.<br/><br/>This game was ported to Super Nintendo and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and included some new play modes: Vs. Battle, Practice Mode, Time Attack and a &quot;Life Attack&quot; that consists of defeating as many opponents as possible with just one life bar (similar to the Survival Modes seen in other fighting games).<br/><br/>The Mega Drive version had a Battle Royal mode where 1 or 2 players can select a team, with an option to hide the characters being chosen and they would not be revealed until during gameplay.

Its citizens were highly advanced in the arts of magic, and even retained some vestiges of magical quasi-technologies perhaps more ancient than humankind itself. Their prosperity made for jealous enemies, none more covetous than the powerful and sorcerous Kiengaa Tribe of the deep jungles.

Yet none of the gods answered his prayers until the last &ndash; and that was Ojala, whom the people of Madaro-Shanti knew as a god of evil and treachery.

In the shadow of the giants dwelled the trouping elves and their erstwhile goblin enemies, fighting and feasting and making sport of life. The coming of the golden men from the west sent the proud elves and vicious goblins into hiding, for they commanded powerful magics and built a grand city of metal and crystal. But the reach of the golden men exceeded their grasp, and within a few generations their city had fallen and sent its children into the valley as orphans, and the elves and goblins worked their vengeance on them until only a few bands of the golden men, as wild and savage as the beasts, still roam the Valley. And so our adventurers arrive in the Valley of the Hawks seeking fame and fortune. Perhaps they come from northern lands or southern lands or perhaps they were born in the Valley and seek to learn its secrets and use its wealth to found a new city in the manner of the long gone golden men, a city that shines and terrifies and engraves their names forever in the stories of elves and men.<br/><br/>"}, "109754": {"rpgartist": ["Rowena Aitken", "Robert Altbauer", "MKultra Studio"], "rpgitemversion": ["First printing", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Winter Woods (Pathfinder)", "rpgdesigner": ["Skeeter Green", "John M.

This was a wilderness survival game that consisted of a hexagonal map system that players would travel around, trying to find their way back to civilization, all the while trying not to die of thirst or get eaten by bears. This game map was used as the first wilderness &quot;hex-crawl&quot; for what eventually became D&amp;D. Later, Judges Guild took this to a whole new level with the Wilderlands series. For many years, hex crawling was just the way the game was played. This series brings that back, or supplements existing games that use that system of travel.<br/><br/>What a hex crawl is, literally, is a wilderness sandbox of areas, encounters and villages that players travel around in. It provides no story line, just hundreds of story hooks and possibilities.<br/><br/>These books provide a sub-setting in your own campaign world. They populate the world, and allow you to let your players explore that world, rather than just &quot;travel 20 days&quot; to the dungeon. Written by John Stater of NOD fame, each of these supplements details an area with a specific theme. Monster and NPC statistics are provided for each encounter area detailed.<br/><br/>Among the reasons many adventurers choose to end their days in the cannibal-ridden, hurricane-savaged isles of the south is the immense distance it puts between them and the terrible land beyond the Black Water. The Black Water is a great inland sea filled with black, viscous water that sits as still as death. Nobody but a fool would willingly cross the Black Water, save for the strange men who sail the black arks, but many fools have crossed those waters in search of a lost love or a secret taken to the grave, for beyond the Black Water and its grey shores lies the icy Land of the Dead.<br/><br/>"}, "109757": {"rpgartist": ["Rowena Aitken", "MKultra Studio"], "rpgitemversion": ["First printing", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Hollow Mountain (Pathfinder)", "rpgdesigner": ["Uri Kurlianchik"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert Altbauer", "Skeeter Green", "Bill Webb", "Charles Wright (I)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1451456.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Frog God Games"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Saturday Night Special"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1451456_t.png", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>Hollow Mountain is designed for four to six characters of 8th to 12th levels. We recommend 40&ndash;50 total character levels between the party members. While the characters can be of any basic character class, a good mix of character classes is helpful. A rogue, strong warrior type, and good-aligned cleric are all extremely valuable in this adventure, druids will be especially useful in the Hollow Mountain and have the greatest motivation to participate in it. A traditionally peaceful tribe of nomadic wood elves suddenly becomes hostile and starts raiding neighboring human settlements with murderous zeal. It seems that the main object of these raids is prisoner capturing and wanton, senseless destruction of any man-made objects.<br/><br/>The PCs are hired by the local baron to investigate the cause of this sudden change of heart in his former allies and soon discover that tribe has abandoned its traditional nomadic lifestyle and taken up residence inside a famous local landmark called the Hollow Mountain.<br/><br/>The Hollow Mountain is a very sharp, lone mountain that sticks from the dense forests of the region like a rotten tooth. It derives its name from the fact that it is almost completely empty inside. On their way to rescue the victims, the PCs encounter a wounded and scared satyr who tells them that plants and sylvan creatures in the area are corrupted by some vile infl uence that must be destroyed before the whole forest turns on its inhabitants. As they proceed the PCs are attacked by strange and hostile plant creatures that resemble man-sized flowers with dagger-like petals and groups of elven fanatics armed with poisonous arrows. These fanatics claim to be leading a holy war against the unnatural and corrupted civilization and the &ldquo;false&rdquo; that produced it.<br/><br/>Once inside the mountain the PCs must brave cave after cave of different misshapen enemies, mutant elves and their animalistic masters and prehistoric plants and monsters. Finally, they pass into a nightmarish plane through a portal opened ages ago by highly-advanced lizardfolk who once occupied the Hollow Mountain and experimented with powerful magic in its higher levels. There they face the unlikely master of this insane unholy war, the Tree That Sees, a tree-like aberration from before the dawn of time that threatens to spill its madness into the world.<br/><br/>Remember when the world was a sandbox and you just inserted modules into your campaign whenever and wherever you wanted to? Remember when companies like Judges Guild and TSR produced short stand alone modules, not tied to any setting or campaign? Remember when the cost 5 bucks (ok we can&rsquo;t do print books for 5 bucks anymore, but we can do that for the pdfs)? Remember when you directed the action independent of what the &ldquo;world&rdquo; rules said was there? We do, and in response we decided to fill the gap with our One Night Stands and Saturday Night Specials series.<br/><br/>These modules are designed to be played over the course of 1-2 nights. Each is a sandbox style short adventure (One Night Stands) or a short dungeon crawl (Saturday Night Specials).<br/><br/>"}, "109758": {"rpgartist": ["Rowena Aitken", "Richard Sardinha"], "rpgitemversion": ["First printing", "PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Strange Bedfellows (Pathfinder)", "rpgdesigner": ["Matthew Finch", "Carla Harker"], "rpgproducer": ["Skeeter Green", "Richard Sardinha", "Bill Webb", "Charles Wright (I)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1614592.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Frog God Games"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1614592_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>A circus show erupts in mayhem when goblinoids crash the performance, slaughtering performers and audience members alike.

The module is written by Dennis Sustare, the designer and author of the original Druid class that has become a key character class in virtually every fantasy game ever written since 1978. I&rsquo;ve done almost no editing of Dennis&rsquo;s text, although the tournament format has been shifted around to be more easily used during play. The result is that you are about to read an adventure that&rsquo;s a direct window into the imagination of one of the great figures of fantasy gaming. Any typographical errors or glitches in the &ldquo;flow&rdquo; of the adventure are the responsibility of the editor, and all the high-adventurous moments of this fast-moving, gripping adventure are to the credit of the author.<br/><br/>In addition to being written by Dennis Sustare, the module has cover artwork contributed by Paul Jaquays, who is also one of the great figures of fantasy gaming art. This new artwork sees the return of Paul&rsquo;s unique style, which will be instantly recognizable by those who gamed during the seventies and early eighties; it is an iconic, original vision of swords &amp; sorcery that has not been seen on the cover of a module for decades. We&rsquo;re proud to be able to bring a new piece of Jaquays art to younger gamers who may never have seen examples of it before. He portrays a world that is stark and fierce, more visceral than art based on high fantasy, with the sort of rough-edged heroes who inhabit the fiction of sword &amp; sorcery&rsquo;s earlier days, before the world-shaking influence of JRR Tolkien rearranged the foundations of the genre at every conceivable level.<br/><br/>"}, "109760": {"rpgdesigner": ["Richard Baker", "Bart Carroll", "Bruce R.

Enemy territory corresponds to the 5 rows on the opponents side of the board. The middle row, marked with the crisscrosses, is considered the front line of the battle and therefore mutually shared by both sides.<br/><br/>A player may also win by making it impossible for their opponent to create a Phalanx, either by capturing all four of their opponent's Lords or reducing their opponent's Warriors to three or less.<br/><br/>Warriors slide like rooks in Chess, i.e. any number of empty spaces up, down, left,or right. It can also make a single jump over another piece of either color that is adjacent to it horizontally or vertically. The jumping piece lands on the other side. This is not a capture. The only capturing is achieved by sandwiching your opponent's pieces between yours along a row or column. This is similar to Reversi, except that the pieces are removed from the board instead of flipped. A sandwich capture along an edge may wrap around the corner.<br/><br/>Lords have the additional power of moving and capturing diagonally. So they slide like Queens in Chess, i.e. any number of empty spaces up, down, left, right or diagonally. They may jump over another piece in any direction.

Each player will draft cards into a deck, use those cards to send Trade Caravans across Asia, and build opportunities in trade, military and the court. Players must work together to trade goods while competing to build cards and gain victory points.<br/><br/>Win: Players gain Victory Points (VP) by sending trade caravans across the Silk Road Trade Map and buying/building cards on their side of the Map. The game ends when one player builds 10 cards. At that point the player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>Needed to Play: <br/>&bull; The deck of 54 cards (53 game cards and 1 Player Aid card).<br/>&bull; The game board showing the Silk Road map.<br/>&bull; 18 eurocubes in each of 6 colors (blue, red, yellow, green, white, purple) to represent the Trade Goods, plus 1 additional red and yellow eurocube for the Victory Point track.<br/>&bull; 15 gray/black eurocubes to represent Artisans.<br/>&bull; 3 pawns in red and yellow to represent the Trade Caravans.<br/><br/>Setup: Decide who will be the Han Dynasty and the Roman Empire and place the Silk Road Trade Map between both players. This map allows players to track their Trade Caravans across the Silk Road through Asia. It also designates areas for players to build fields of cards in the game to gain Victory Points.<br/><br/>Play: <br/>Each round of the game consists of 4 phases. Each player will complete all phases in turn. Player 1 going first, followed by Player 2.<br/>(Note: Card abilities in a Player&rsquo;s Empire may be used at any time during <br/>phases 1-3, and all card abilities are cumulative.)<br/><br/>&bull; Phase 1: Production                                                                           <br/>During Phase 1, the active player has 8 Production Points (PP) to spend. Production points are used to produce trade goods and hire artisans, which are in turn, used to buy cards, build cards and send Trade Caravans across the Silk Road for VP.<br/><br/>&bull; Phase 2: Buy/Build/Defend                                                                              <br/>The active player may now do any of the following 3 actions. Actions must, however, be in the following order:<br/><br/>A. Buy: Buy one or more cards from the Crossroads by discarding the correct number and type of trade goods listed on the card, from a player&rsquo;s supply. After buying a card, the player places this card on their discard pile next to their Player Empire (unless a card ability in a Player&rsquo;s Empire states otherwise), and replaces the card just purchased with a new card from the Crossroads draw pile. If there are no more cards in the Crossroads draw pile, cards cannot be replaced.<br/><br/>B. Build: Build one or more cards from your player empire by discarding the correct number of artisans equal to the build cost as listed on the card. Place this card in one of the 4 fields located to the left or right of the Silk Road Trade Map as designated by the player&rsquo;s color (Note: a player may only build cards to their side of the Trade Map). Built cards gain victory points for the player. Add these victory points to the player&rsquo;s total on the Victory Point Track. Built cards no longer have their card abilities available to the player; they are now worth only victory points and, in some cases, defensive strength.<br/><br/>Players may not switch cards in any field once built.<br/><br/>Players may not build a card more than 3 cards in distance out from the Silk Road Trade Map<br/><br/>Cards in fields do not have to match in name, type or color.<br/><br/>Cards must be adjacent for additional stacked victory points.<br/><br/>C. Defend: Defeat one Enemy card from the Crossroads if the total defensive strength in your player field is equal to or greater than the Enemy card&rsquo;s strength. Remove the Enemy card from the game and replace the empty space with a new card from the Crossroads draw pile. Gain any victory points and awards as listed on the Enemy card.<br/><br/>&bull; Phase 3: Trade                                                                                <br/>The active player may now do only one of the following:<br/><br/>a. Begin a new Trade Caravan: <br/>A player may ship up to 4 trade goods at any one time in a single Trade Caravan. They may ship fewer if they choose to. The Warehouse and Trading Post cards can add extra trade goods to a Trade Caravan.<br/><br/>A player may move all of their Trade Caravan pawns one space towards the opposing player. (Note: Each Trader card in your Player Empire allows Trade Caravans to move one additional space during this phase). <br/>Any Enemy abilities are now applied for any Enemy cards in the Crossroads. These may result in the loss of Trade Goods or entire Trade Caravans. Trade Goods have the following values when determining which to lose: Gold and Silk (3), Wine and <br/>Porcelain (2), Glassware and Spices (1).<br/>If a player must lose an entire Trade Caravan, they may choose which to remove.<br/><br/>&bull; Phase 4: Discard                                                                           <br/>The active player must now discard all cards from their Player Empire to their discard pile and deal out 4 new cards from their draw pile to their Player Empire. If there are not enough cards left to draw from, shuffle the discard pile and create a new draw pile. If there are still not enough cards to deal out 4 new cards the player will not have 4 cards in their Player Empire in the next round.<br/><br/>Any Crossroads cards that have been discarded (not those that have been defeated during Phase 2) should be shuffled back into the Crossroads draw deck.<br/><br/>End Game: Once a player has built 10 cards to their respective field the game ends immediately.

It is an African checkers variant played on a special pattern that is different from the well-known Alquerque pattern. Whereas the Alquerque pattern reduces the number of diagonals, the Kharbaga pattern reduces the number of orthogonals. The result is a different game dynamic. It is a very attractive checkers variant, not the least drawish. Although the number of squares is only 42, the many movement freedoms of the pieces make it a complex game.<br/>Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. The pieces can step in the three forward directions, and capture, by the short leap, in all directions. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters. Counters are promoted to Mullahs (Sultans) at the last rank. If the counter, during a capturing sequence, makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square, it does not promote to Mullah. The Mullah moves and captures in all directions. It can move any number of squares, like the King in international draughts, and land anywhere behind a captured piece. Capture is obligatory. Two types of variants have been implemented, one in which captured counters stay on the board until the capturing sequence has ended, and one in which counters are removed instantly. Note that one must always choose the line with the most captures.<br/><br/>A counter moves to an empty adjacent point. If an adjacent point is occupied by an enemy counter and the point directly behind is vacant, then one must jump over it and capture it, as in checkers. Several pieces may be captured like this in a single turn.<br/><br/>"}, "109798": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph J.

Regular season games can also be customized while games in the &quot;arcade mode&quot; use the 1995 NBA Playoffs. Players can be substituted before a game but not during it.

Its original Japanese incarnation was the Sega Mark III, which was first released in 1985.<br/><br/>When the system was later released in North America it was sold in two incarnations: a bare-bones console with one controller bundle called the &quot;Sega Base System&quot;, and a bundle with two controllers and a light gun entitled the &quot;Sega Master System&quot;. It was this latter configuration that became the more popular and better known of the two, and the system almost immediately became synonymous with this bundle. The system itself appears to have originally been intended to have been referred to as the &quot;Sega Power Base&quot; in English-speaking markets, and the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive adapter that lets you play Master System games was later referred to as &quot;Power Base Converter&quot;.<br/><br/>In the European, Oceania and Brazilian markets, this console launched Sega onto a competitive level comparable to Nintendo, due to its wider availability, but failed to put a dent in the North American and Japanese markets.<br/><br/>The Master System was released as a direct competitor to the Nintendo Entertainment System in the third videogame generation. Despite its shaky performance in the major territories, it enjoyed over a decade of life in smaller markets.<br/><br/>The later Sega Game Gear is effectively a hand-held Master System, with a few enhancements, although it required an adapter to play actual Master System cartridges.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sega Master System&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "109835": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Martin Goddard"], "poll": [], "name": "Hammerin' Iron 2011", "playingtime": "150", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven"], "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "7", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2252565_t.jpg", "average": "7.28571", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Peter Pig"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2252565.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": ["American Civil War", "Miniatures", "Nautical"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "150", "description": "This miniatures rule set is a 2011 re-issue and re-working of the earlier Hammerin' Iron and Hammerin' Iron 2.<br/><br/>The rules are backed with a large range of 1/600th miniatures, a hexgrid play mat and various markers and accessories.<br/><br/>There are amended game systems within the rules, but at heart the game retains the same historical focus on naval warfare in the American Civil War. As such the earlier historical description comments still apply:<br/><br/>&quot;This set of rules are intended to cover the engagements that took place between 1861 and 1865 during the American Civil War. The location of the actions would be on the great rivers of the eastern seaboard of North America. Such rivers would be the James, Mississippi and Yazoo. The rules have been designed with the specific objective of providing a playable game that gives the flavour of the period by imparting the major features and generalising on lesser matters. A brief outline of the conflict would go as follows. The two sides were known as the confederates(CSA) and the Union(USA). The union tended to have a much larger fleet. At the outset the union fleet consisted of mainly wooden vessels. The confederates quickly built ironclads(armoured vessels with extremely thick armour). These ironclads quickly proved wooden ships to be greatly inferior. This was illustrated several times when a single confederate ironclad would scatter four or five wooden ships. The CSA ships tended to be conversions . The quality of engines, materials and armaments varied wildly often toward the poorer end. The USA soon fielded some excellent ironclads along the famous monitor design which overall were better ships than the long CSA Ram/Ironclads.<br/><br/>As far as guns were concerned there are a few generalities that may give the player more feel for the period. The principles of fire and effect fell into two ideals. The first ideal was that of &ldquo;punching&rdquo;. Punching was the concept of the round going through the armour and causing great damage inside. Battering was the concept of smashing against the armour so hard that the plates would break off or the force would be transmitted to the area beyond the armour. Both methods have merit but it is punching that rules modern day thinking now that such items as fused shells and very high velocity guns are available.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "109836": {"rpgdesigner": ["Wolfgang Baur", "Tom Baxa", "Tim Beach", "Mike Cohen", "Christopher J.

But steering a flying carpet to the proper destination is a lot trickier than it sounds. A strong wind can push a carpet off its course and into a desert, even though its intended destination was the camel bazaar. But maybe the magic lamp can still save the day?<br/><br/>In Fliegende Teppiche (&quot;Flying Carpets&quot;), players try to guide their flying carpets to the most attractive destinations to score the most points &ndash; and by &quot;guide&quot; read &quot;toss&quot; as the carpets are actually cards. To set up the game, each player receives one carpet (two in a two-player game) and a set of genie cards.

A card can't be placed more than the width of a card away from other cards, and at least 1 cm must separate adjacent cards. After revealing twelve cards, the player can swap cards or rearrange them to some degree. Then the player to her left &quot;flies&quot; his carpet onto the destination cards, followed by each other player with the active player going last. Once all carpets have flown, check to see who claims what:<br/><br/><br/>    If a carpet lies on no destination cards (or is only underneath cards), return it to its owner, who receives nothing.<br/>    If a carpet is alone on top of one or more destination cards, the carpet's owner claims these cards, whether or not he wants to.<br/>    If more than one carpet is on a destination card, the players involved simultaneously reveal one of their genie cards.

Each player is the head of the military forces of one of the opposing star powers.  The rules aren't extensive, but wide enough to cover many nuances of intense fighting in the Star Era. There are two ways of shooting: real and virtual. Some weapons actually launch plastic missiles. Virtual firing is resolved using dice rolls. The rules contain corresponding chapters if players wish to switch from one firing way to another. Warriors, cannons and fighting machines are snap together kits requiring no glue for assembly.<br/><br/>"}, "109946": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Hollow Earth Expedition"], "poll": [], "name": "Guide to Elite Nazi Units (Ubiquity)", "rpgdesigner": ["Paul \"Wiggy\" Wade-Williams"], "rpgproducer": ["Lee F.
