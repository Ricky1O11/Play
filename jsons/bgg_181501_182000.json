During the Souls of the Dead Phase, players move souls along the Path of the Dead toward docked ferries. During the Ferry Phase, players move their ferries along the river Acheron.<br/><br/>Different souls (Lovers, Families, Spartans, Merchants, etc.) have different movement rates, restrictions, special abilities and delivery fares. Players vie to maneuver beneficial combinations of souls onto their ferry and detrimental combinations onto their opponents' ferries.<br/><br/>The monsters Cetus (a many-tentacled river horror), and Cerberus (guardian of the Gates of Hades) pose a hazard to players. Three random Gods &amp; Goddesses are in play each game. Players who sacrifice the most bulls to a God or Goddess receive their favor; players who sacrifice the fewest bulls receive their wrath. Favor is generally beneficial and wrath is generally harmful. Effects vary by God or Goddess and have a large impact on gameplay. A key component of strategy is that nearly any positive effect can be negative in some circumstances and vice versa. For example, an upgraded ferry is larger than the default ferry, but may take more turns to load.<br/><br/>A player wins the game when they deliver nine souls to the Gates of Hades or accumulate 30 coins worth of money.<br/><br/>"}, "181537": {"poll": {}, "name": "Erlebnis Nationalpark", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1993", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2613300_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2613300.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"280739": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "age": "9", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A journey through the German national parks.

Cubes of multiple colors move around a Mancala styled &quot;Brain Board,&quot; tracking potential problems with crowds, hunger and bathroom needs, and your child's craving for a special souvenir.  Grouping too many cubes of the same color create a potential for disaster.

Waging war on each other for generations, the battle-scarred Nations of Trederra use Dark Stone to fuel their engines of death, polluting their planet with radiation and drifting clouds of toxic gas. But there are also treasures to be found amidst the devastation, weapons and technology advanced beyond reckoning by brutal centuries of warfare.<br/><br/>The Trederra Deluxe Expansion introduces a brand new OtherWorld for the Heroes to explore!  This includes a full set of 18 new Map Tiles depicting the war-torn planet of Trederra, with dangerous new Radioactive Spaces and Cover Terrain! These Map Tiles also have an all new set of unique Mine rooms on the reverse, bringing more variety and new Encounters to discover throughout the Mines.  All of the cards needed for this alien world are included, such as Trederran Encounters, Artifacts, Map Cards, OtherWorld Threats, and more, as well as a host of new cards for adventuring in the Mines!  6 New Missions will challenge your Heroes as well.<br/><br/>This Deluxe OtherWorld Expansion includes a host of dangerous new Enemies to encounter, including: 6 Trederran Legionnaires - Alien soldiers committed to the cause of &lsquo;winning the war&rsquo; for their Nation and armed with deadly Dark Stone weaponry to get the job done. 3 large Z-4 Grenadiers - Heavily armored demolition soldiers immune to all but the strongest attacks and armed with terrifying thermal charges. 6 Trederran Mutants - Soldiers who have succumbed to the corrupting radiation of the Dark Stone and are now little more than viciously mindless savages. And 3 Trederran Lieutenants - Ruthless officers that command their legions with an iron fist.  Also included are 6 pieces of plastic Cover Terrain (3x Barrels and 3x Tank Traps). These are for use with the Cover Terrain rules and are placed on the board to give a more 3D feel to the Environment.<br/><br/>Like all OtherWorlds, Trederra has a set of unique Encounters, Artifacts, Map Cards, and OtherWorld Threat cards, as well as a couple of Global Rules that make adventuring there more distinct. The Global Rules are listed on the World Card included in this expansion.  While exploring Trederra, Heroes will find themselves navigating an extremely hostile environment full of Land Mines, poisonous Toxic Clouds, Acid Rain, and relentless patrols of Enemies, always on the hunt for intruders.

They may bargain with the Demons of the One Below for power, or dedicate themselves to serve the One Above. They may seek out and drain raw mana from the world from which to study the Arts, and gather the resources to build up their laboratory and libraries where they study the great arts. Their aim is to seek the knowledge and power to carry out the Great Rites when the stars are right and bind into themselves the essence of magic itself.<br/><br/>Magus the board game brings the freedom and flexibility of role-playing to a board game, giving players options and choices to make without setting out what path to follow or in what sequence to carry out actions. The innovative season based turn mechanic ensures the world turns on its cycles around the Magi as they act, constantly offering them new options to consider. It stresses high levels of player interaction with trading, duelling and competing for objectives while excluding player elimination.<br/><br/>Each turn represented a season, starting with part of the board updating depending on which season is happening. Players then choose which action to take - harvesting mana, seeking an encounter with a mythic creature to fight or bargain with it, visit the market to buy equipment and minions or stay in their scantum to research the magical arts. If players compete for the same action, a quick card based bluffing mechanic is used.<br/><br/>"}, "181608": {"rpgitemversion": {"280923": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Test Drive: Featuring the Exclusive Adventure Triple Cross for Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2613194.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": {"409": "Lankhmar / Nehwon"}, "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"1013": "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2622": "Quick Start / Fast Play Rules"}, "rpgseries": {"18365": "Savage Worlds Test Drive"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2613194_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Have you ever wanted to try a game of Savage Worlds?

Building space vehicles with a unique array of instrument cards, you move about the Solar System, explore planets and moons and find different science discoveries.<br/><br/>Space exploration is full of mystery, and Project Discovery has been given funding to discover some of these mysteries. You've been tasked with destinations to explore, uncovering new science as you probe each site with your vehicle and its instruments.<br/><br/>The game is a mix of mechanics including: random chit pulling, modified dice rolls, action choices, light deck building.<br/><br/>The game is setup by randomly pulling 4 destination cards (from a deck of 22) face up onto the map board. These represent the only destinations explorable for the game. On top of each destination card a hidden discovery chit is placed, representing 1 possible science discovery (science discoveries are worth victory points). The player starts with funding which allows him to buy cards and pay for other things in the game. Every 3 years there's a funding increase.<br/><br/>Each turn the player chooses from a list of free actions (building a vehicle mission by buying instrument cards, launching a mission, etc) and a list of choice actions, choosing 3 from a list of 8, these are the actions that move the game forward.<br/><br/>To explore each destination, there are 3 exploration types; Using the Space Exploratory tokens from Earth orbit, sending an Explorer Mission or sending a Vehicle Mission. Only vehicle missions can find discoveries. They are a collection of up to 4 cards purchase with funding (thruster, GNC support, 2 instrument cards). The Explorer Missions are single stand-alone cards that model the real life Voyager Probes, there are 2 for each game and are sent before the vehicle missions to gather data about any particular destination. The data is gained by successfully rolling the explorer mission exploration number at a destination which allows a choice of adding a second discovery, flipping a discovery already there, or adding a modifier to a future Vehicle Mission's success roll.<br/><br/>Each instrument has a discovery type and base roll number to roll when performing a discovery roll. Successfully finding a discovery is done by getting an instrument card to the destination by using the thruster card to move the vehicle map piece along planet, moon or inter-planet spaces  and once at the destination of choice rolling a die. The success roll can be modified from previous game play to better the odds of success.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"280908": "First Edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Project Discovery", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "average": "7", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"19564": "Solitaire Print and Play Contest"}}, "181631": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2638954.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"184183": {"name": "Rum & Bones: La Brise Sanguine Heroes Set #1"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"75733": {"name": "Michael Shinall"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamepublisher": {"21608": {"name": "CMON Limited"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2638954_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "description": "The French pirate faction known as ''La Brise sanguine'' (&quot;The Cold Bloody Wind&quot;) brings dynamic new mechanics to the world of Rum &amp; Bones.

This is good advice. Don&rsquo;t go see her as an emissary of another necromancer. Don&rsquo;t brag about your own necromantic magics. Don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re friends with a death conjurer. She hates the other undead. She hates people who control the undead. If you&rsquo;re good at fighting the undead &mdash; or wizards &mdash; she might have a job for you.<br/><br/>They&rsquo;ll tell you not to do business with her, because it&rsquo;s too dangerous, or she&rsquo;s cursed. This is hogwash. Everything is dangerous, everyone is cursed. If you need a new sword arm or a companion brought back from the Gates of Death, she&rsquo;s the one, if you can afford it. A damn sight more polite than most other wizards, too, if you ask me.<br/><br/>But if you find her out in the woods at night, away from the market, you best be careful. Just like other wizards, she doesn&rsquo;t take well to strangers interfering with her business. She&rsquo;s got a buried tower up near that old tomb on Ash Bluff, and no time for visitors. Just because you spoke with her in the market, doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re friends.<br/><br/>"}, "181643": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "GM's Miscellany: Dungeon Dressing - A System-Neutral Resource", "rpgproducer": {"24305": "Creighton Broadhurst"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2614009.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"280924": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"18314": "Dungeon Dressing"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2614009_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Tired of dungeons lacking in verisimilitude?

Their daughter couldn&rsquo;t talk yet, but she &ldquo;spoke&rdquo; to machines. More alarmingly, when she did, they fell into their components, which created a metallic cocoon for the child. None of this was covered by the parenting classes the Moore family had attended. A representative of a group called the Ironclad Project offered to take care of Evelyn, but only if her parents were willing to sign her over to the care of the project. Seeing no other option, they agreed, and Evelyn became the ward of the Ironclad Project.<br/><br/>Years went by, and Evelyn grew, learning to control her powers. She was told that she was being trained to be a part of the army. A new army that fought with better power instead of hundreds of soldiers. However, her lack of control and her hot-headedness meant that the Ironclad Project had little use for her. She had learned to absorb tech to plate herself in steel and coat her skin in wires, talking to the tech as easily as she talked to herself, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. Even though she desperately wanted to prove her worth, those monitoring her kept wanting more than she could give.<br/><br/>Then, one day, she absorbed a tank.<br/><br/>There had been talk of military training going on in the adjacent facility, and Evelyn wanted to know more. Sneaking past her monitors, she found herself next to a massive M1 Abrams tank. It spoke to her of cold steel and internal combustion. It sounded beautiful to her. So she let it fall into its pieces, and she wore its skin.<br/><br/>All hell broke loose in the army base. A tank had just fallen apart, and a person-shaped pile of plate-steel walked out of the wreckage. Soldiers opened fire on the figure, who ran through a wall, disappearing into the nearby hills.<br/><br/>Since then, Choke has been a regular opponent of the Freedom Five and their allies. She is frequently at the heart of troubles concerning military installations or stockpiles of weapons. It was hardly surprising that she ended up allying with the Vengeful Five when Baron Blade called. But when she was fatally wounded by K.N.Y.F.E., many believed that would be the end of Choke.<br/><br/>However, Choke had heard a peculiar voice - unlike any she had heard before. The Freedom Five had recently prevented Deadline from destroying the earth, and the alien&rsquo;s odd device was still housed in their headquarters. And she could hear its voice. It could save her, and she could give it purpose once again.<br/><br/>Evelyn drew the resonating crystal at the heart of the device into herself, sealing her wound, but also opening her mind to the powers of the alien tech. It could sense weak points. She was originally trained to save the world, and now she knew how. She would show those at Project Ironclad that she was worthwhile after all. Using her new knowledge, she would erase all the weak points from the world. All she needed was a bit more power&hellip;<br/><br/>With the necessary elements right at hand, Chokepoint was born. Taking power from the tech of the heroes around her, Evelyn is on a self-appointed quest to destroy the weak points of the world, and beyond.<br/><br/>Chokepoint&rsquo;s scope is without limit. She already has growing concerns that the star at the center of this galaxy will eventually die or explode, and that getting rid of it sooner rather than later might be necessary&hellip;<br/><br/>Chokepoint is a mini-expansion given as a pre-order bonus for Sentinels of the Multiverse: Villains of the Multiverse.<br/><br/>"}, "181685": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Temporal", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"280978": "Windows Downloadable Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2331": "Space"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "In Temporal, players control an unnamed robotical being which cannot recall his past and tries to figure out where he is, and his purpose.

The issue, however, is that many legacy tinker expansions focused on the endgame and are effectively carrots dangled in front of the player to stay on that leveling treadmill. While that's fine if there's plenty of content at low levels, the continued creation of such expansions ended up making the class fairly lopsided.<br/><br/>Enter the solution.

An automaton with such an invention may have an inventory.<br/><br/>Firework: Fireworks are special in that they are the first inventions ever to occupy an automaton's inventory, and that they require special launchers to shoot.

Her name stands for the style of detailed portrayal of nature &ndash; see her works on the metamorphosis of caterpillars to butterflies. The illustrations in this card game shall breathe life into that style again.<br/><br/>The name Pi mal Pflaumen is a play on the expression &quot;Pi mal Daumen&quot; &mdash; &quot;rule of thumb&quot; or &quot;roughly&quot; &mdash; which also originated in that period, but now instead of thumbs, players are concerned with fruit. On a turn, players play one fruit card from their hand at a time, then they each claim one of the played cards based on the strength of the card that they played. Each card depicts a fruit, and some of the cards also feature a scoring pattern (e.g., hand in three identical fruits or two pairs of matching fruits) or a special action, such as collecting an additional plum card, stealing a card from an opponent, taking the dog to protect yourself from theft, or collecting three &pi; cards (which can be played singly or in combination with a number card to increase the value of your initial play).<br/><br/>After a number of turns based on the number of players, the round ends, then players receive a new hand of cards.

Designed for two to four players, the game pits two ancient beings of great power against one another to determine which of their lineage are strongest. The players use sorcery to conjure minions, cast minions, and wield enchanted items to reach the game's goal of conquering three battlefields.<br/><br/>The game uses a simple resource system of &quot;energy&quot; that is determined randomly by a dice-roll at the beginning of each round, to make sure no round is the same. However, the outcome being the same for both players, the game balance stays even. This energy is then used in the Action Phase for conjuring minions from your hand on any of three battlefields, casting possessions that can improve your minion's traits and abilities; or sorcery cards with various direct effects. Also as an action you can add more energy to your Energy Pool, draw more cards, move minions to another battlefield etc. The choice is yours, it is just about your pure skill to handle the battle preparation!<br/><br/>In the Battle Phase players roll amount of custom dice equal to each minion's attack trait with possible outcome of miss, hit, double hit or critical hit for each die, and place damage counters on the respective minions or directly to the Battlefield. A unique system of Omen tokens then allows to adjust this outcome by re-rolling the dice, before distributing the damage among opponent's minions and battlefield.<br/><br/>The combination of usual mechanics like story driven deck building, push your luck or dice-rolling; and a unique system of influencing the outcome of the battle, provides a perfect balance between strategy and random elements (even you still have the possibility to influence the outcome). Dividing the round to the Action Phase and Battle Phase then creates a very pleasant and natural flow of the hardcore game play.<br/><br/>Sorcerer was first developed in 2012, and in 2014, Peter Scholtz consulted with Czech and Slovak board gaming communities intensively to fine tune the mechanics of the game. In August 2014, the first &ldquo;Print and Play&rdquo; demo version of Sorcerer was published, responding to all the remarks and feedback Peter Scholtz received, allowing him to create both his upgraded, native language demo and finally the, English language version of Sorcerer. The Sorcerer prototype was available for the wide audience as a free to play testing material over the year 2014. After anotoher year of intense work and listening to the game community Peter Scholtz went to Essen Spiel to meet some of the greatest board game publishers and show them the game. After a meeting with Rob Dougherty, CEO of the White Wizard Games, game designer (Star Realms, Hero Realms, Epic card game) and least but not last mtg hall of fame player, the dice was finally rolled. Over the year 2016 Peter Scholtz become a white wizard games team member and together with them they are preparing the game for its KS campaign launch in year 2017.<br/><br/>"}, "181820": {"rpgitemversion": {"281145": "PDF version"}, "rpgseries": {"27924": "War Stories"}, "name": "Faith vs. Faithlessness", "rpgproducer": {"43932": "Travis Legge"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2615697.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"38751": "Contagion"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"9301": "Contagion Role Playing Game"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"954": "Crime (Conspiracy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2615697_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying place.

Included are the arachnochemist, an alchemist that foregoes traditional mutagens in favor of a strange and unusual concoction that allows them to transform themselves into half-elf, half-spider monstrosities, the underdark barbarian, a barbarian archetype that focuses on speed and maneuverability, outwitting foes in the dark and calling upon inner reserves of strength to rage longer, the drow webstalker, a hunter archetype that grants a special giant spider animal companion that eventually grows to huge size and can spin powerful webs, the drow deathweaver, a warpriest archetype that uses Charisma for spellcasting, and grants access to the exotic spider blessing, and the drow housemage, a wizard archetype that can sacrifice other aspects of themselves in order to boost their Intelligence, and gain greater resistance to magic.<br/><br/>"}, "181858": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Abiron Morikis", "rpgproducer": {"23702": "Rheanna Plemons"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2617854.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"281214": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"28178": "Instant Character"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2617854_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Oops!

The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.  Sources for spells, races, classes, archetypes, and prestige classes from sources other than the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&trade; (PZO1110) are listed in the Sources section and can be referenced in the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Reference Document.<br/><br/>At the end of this document is a sheet of character and spell tokens including a token for this character and assorted Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and spell effects.

This book provides all of the basic parts of the D&amp;G system to craft your own unique worlds. This pen &amp; paper dice based system uses reduced character classes, a stylized turn based combat system, a simplified skill system, skill-based psionics system and a unique and detailed skill-based magic/spell system. This allows Game Masters and Players near complete freedom to craft worlds and characters to their personal tastes and needs in any game setting imaginable.<br/><br/>The overall D&amp;G system consists of:<br/><br/>    A unique &quot;cash-in&quot; Experience point system where players can build fully customized characters bit-by-bit and gain points for such actions as playing in character. Experience points are used to buy such things as feats, and combat bonuses which have attached experience point costs.<br/>    Characters are built from initial basic character classes which generalize the character's role in the campaign and from there the player evolves them by spending experience points. The simplified character classes are: Brick, Fighter, Adventurer, Rogue, Mage, Psychic and Clergy even Classless! Character classes determine bonus HD, your primary saving throw and a single class ability.<br/>    A detailed but easy-to-use Combat system using its own class-like level system. Combat is turn based using a melee round system where a player gets a set number of attacks/actions per melee round and where 4 melee rounds equals 1 minute. It also uses a D20 + modifiers for resolution and defined combat maneuvers to allow customization of fighting style.<br/>    A skill system that is easy to use and adapt to any situation. Skill definitions are general and allow for their narrowing to a specialized purpose. Skills use points to raise their rank, are dependent on a given base attribute and use a D20 + modifiers for resolution.<br/>    A unique and in depth Magic system which uses a magic source system that determines if casting a spell is a skill-based check, point expenditure or limited by a number of spells per day. Spells are composed of well defined modular parameters which allow for Game Masters and players to easily learn to write their own.<br/>    And the skill-based Psionics distinguishes itself from the magic system no longer relegating psionics to &quot;a poor man's magic system&quot;! Psionic powers are skill based rolls where the difficulty is determined by a flexible list of modifiers for distance, targets and area of effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The system also incorporates a detailed uncanny abilities system used for creature abilities or for use as powers in a super-hero campaign and a full chapter on constructing monsters and races for Game Masters.

The overall location, the central action, and the descriptive language are (mostly) Blackwood&rsquo;s, in his own words wherever we could justify his style. The greater plot behind the island are ours; we hope Mr. Blackwood would have approved of the direction we took his story.<br/><br/>Scenario Description:<br/><br/>&quot;A Haunted Island&quot; will put your PCs straight into a classic ghost story:<br/><br/>A small group of characters spends a fortnight on an isolated island in order to rest after a particularly harrowing adventure, perhaps to catch up on some scroll scribing. The island in question is on the edge of a frontier only subdued in the last twenty years, with the prevailing barbarian tribes still very much extant, though now mostly confined to an empire-sanctioned reservation located fifteen miles from the island. They remain a fierce people, but after a bru-tal defeat by the empire a generation earlier they mostly keep to themselves, though they are free by treaty to hunt and fish in the forests and lakes near the island.<br/><br/>After a few days spent in relative peace and iso-lation, the PCs begin to experience an acute sensa-tion of fear when they wake up in their beds each morning. This sensation of fear heightens until they can no longer stand to repose in their beds, upon which they experience a phantom visitation.<br/><br/>A note about system:<br/><br/>This product is published as a &ldquo;system-neutral&rdquo; product.

Due to Atlantis being an island in the ocean, many materials such as wood, stone, and metal are extremely rare and valuable in Atlantis.

There are 162 Cards total in the game that are divided into three decks: the Battle Deck, The Event Deck and the Territory Deck.<br/><br/>The Battle deck is made up of Unit cards, Special cards and Icon cards. These cards are drawn by the players and used to make their bids.<br/><br/>Unit cards are divided into four types: Troops, Tanks, Planes and Support. These all have a face value and different ratios within the Battle deck. There are more Troops than anything, but they are much lower value than Tanks or Planes. Support units have two values- a defense value and an attack value. If someone is trying to steal a territory you have captured they can be a powerful deterrent!<br/><br/>Icon cards feature famous personalities from different nations and they each grant bonuses or special effects based on their role in the war. The famous spy Virginia Hall allows you to see an opponent&rsquo;s hand and swap a card. Patton gives a per-card bonus to Tank units. Vasily Zaytsev and Lyudmilla Pavlichenko are snipers that can take out enemy Icons. <br/> Special cards generally have special rules that can be disruptive to your opponents. Advanced Fighters boost your Plane values. Typhus eliminates all opponent Troops in a display. Blockades can stop an opponent from using any territory bonuses they may have.<br/><br/>The Territory deck contains territory cards that players bid for in battles. Winning territories not only gets you closer to winning, but players with a controlling share of a territory type get a bonus that is unique to that country. The USSR gets a bonus to Defense cards. Germany gets a bonus for Tanks. <br/>The Event deck contains random events that can have a major impact on how a battle progresses. Fog of War forces all players to swap the cards in their hand with a new draw from the Battle deck. Winter impacts all Unit cards played for the rest of a battle, forcing players to commit more cards to a bid in order to stay in.<br/><br/>Game play is fairly straightforward. Players make bids to capture territories by placing cards from their hand face up into their display in order to outbid their opponents and capture Territory cards. Bid values consist of the cumulative value of the cards - including any modifiers from Special, Icon or Event cards and Territory bonuses.<br/><br/>The turn order consists of three parts: <br/>1.    The first player declares battle and draws one card from the battle deck<br/>2.    The first player makes their bid <br/>3.    Next player either exceeds the previous player&rsquo;s bid by at least one point or withdraws from the battle<br/><br/>Because players only get two opportunities to draw fresh cards &ndash;one at the start of their turn and one when they either win or withdraw- every card is a vital resource. Players that over commit run the risk of leaving themselves open for attack on subsequent battles.  There is an additional &ldquo;digging in&rdquo; rule that allows players to commit cards in piles of 10 points each. This prevents those cards from being affected by other player&rsquo;s burn cards and has the added benefit of cutting down on the amount of math that&rsquo;s required.<br/><br/>This continues until only one player remains, at which point the territory card is awarded to them and they declare the next battle. Victory conditions are based on the number and type of Territory Cards a player has accumulated. 2 of a kind or 3 different territories will win the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"281308": "First edition"}, "average": "6.40909", "name": "Last Front: The Strategy Card Game", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "33", "boardgamefamily": {"24439": "Card Games: Draw and Discard Games"}}, "181930": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2618275.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"50881": {"name": "Darrell Louder"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"12199": "Adam P.

This requires two things: a little luck with the dice, and the opportunism to be at the right place at the right time. In your struggle to reach the top, your opponents will jostle you toward the foot of the mountain. You can do the same right back, but you can also use a chain reaction to shimmy your way to the top.<br/><br/>In Gipfelst&uuml;rmer, which translates as Summiteer but should perhaps be titled Footholds and Foothills due to the author, each player tries to reach the peak with their five mountain goats. On your turn, you can roll dice up to three times. At the end of the turn, you look to see if you fulfill the requirements to move one of your mountain goats toward the summit.<br/><br/>Each path up the mountain has its own dice combination. The closer to the peak, the larger the required dice results (from three-of-a-kind and small straight to full house or five-of-a-kind), and the narrower the paths.

You can perform any of the four possible actions multiple times, and in any order. To activate a character, you must play a specific combination of pearl cards from your hand onto the character card. Activated characters grant you power points, diamonds, or special abilities. Once you have activated characters this way with twelve or more power points then that round becomes the penultimate one.
