Shigeru Myamoto was producer of the game and Koji Kondo co-composed the music.<br/><br/>The main game consists of a series of training areas that take place on a platform in the saea. In each area the player has to partake in four different flying events:<br/> - Light plane: Fly a plane through a series of rings and land the plane on the runway.<br/> - Skydiving: Jump from a helicopter and fly through a series of rings and land on a target area.<br/> - Rocket belt: Lift off, fly through a series of rings and land on a target area.<br/> - Hang glider: Fly using a hang-glider fly through rings and land on a target area. Use thermal currents to ascend.<br/> In every training area the player has to complete the four events and receive points based on the results. Points are rewarded based on landing accuracy, amount of rings flown through and time used. When a certain minimum score in a area is obtained, the player receives the certification for that area. The player can then advance to the next course. A number of areas have a bonus stage which allows for scoring more points. Bonus stages include controlling a man over a series of trampolines and controlling a penguin diving into a pool.<br/><br/>After receiving all certificates the player can do a helicopter mission. After completing that mission, more difficult training missions can be played. The target scores in these levels are higher and they feature more difficult weather conditions.<br/><br/>The game uses Mode 7 to create the 3D-like 'flat'-surface effect as in Mario Kart. <br/>The game was well received.

Decide your strategy, 1 or 2 pit stops or no one? Upon this, your tyres&rsquo; management is vital. Once the red lights turn off, insert the 1st gear and gradually speed up...you will feel like really driving! Pay attention to the curves: if you are driving too fast you could take the longer path or even go out of the track! But if you are good, you will enter the following straight at the best speed! Overtakes, accidents, tires&rsquo; wear, booster, engine damages and rain will add a touch of enchantment to all races.<br/><br/>Formula 1 IS A GAME FOR FAMILIES but SINCE no cards or dice move your car IS ALSO an interesting and appealing GAME FOR GAMERS.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY: cars are not moved by any die but according to the gear in that turn. The gear level is a pawn that can be moved on the own cars' card of one unit any turn, so the drivers can accelerate or slow down engaging a higher or lower gear every turn. <br/>The curves must be faced according to an optimal speed value shown on a sign. If the cars enter the curve with speed higher of 1 or 2 gears than the optimal one they will be forced to drive the entire curve on the outer lane or in the worst case to go out of the track and restart in the 1st gear.<br/>The cars' movement can be powered by playing the tyres cards: at the beginning of the race any driver receives 6 tyres cards (35% of value 1, 48% of value 2 and 17% of value 3).

After any unit movement the defending team can reply with a unit movement trying to mark. All the miniatures have values of speed and passing capabilities, and also 2-points and 3-points percentages values. Therefore players can manage the game as a real NBA game, trying to have the best player in the best shooting position for scoring. When a miniatures decides to shoot a 12-sided die is rolled and the result is eventually diminished by one if the miniature is marked. If the result is equal or lower than the miniature's shooting ability then there is a score.<br/>Situations like blocks, dunks, stealing the ball, illegal defenses, screening, free throws and faults add to the game a high likelihood.

Each attacking miniature is marked when it has from 1 to 6 opponents in the next squares and its movements are always diminished by the same number as the opponents that mark him. The defender can then try to steal possession. Short passes are possible within 4 squares from the ball possessor and long passes and shots at goal are performed by rolling 2 white 6-sided dice.

The game is a first person space simulator, simulating the attack on the Death Star from the 1977 film Star Wars. The game is composed of 3D color vector graphics. This game was developed during the Golden Age of Arcade Games and is considered the #4 most popular game of all time according to the readers of Killer List of Videogames.<br/><br/>The player assumes the role of Luke Skywalker (&quot;Red Five&quot;), as he pilots an X-wing fighter from a first-person perspective. The player's ultimate goal is to destroy the Death Star through three attack phases.<br/><br/>In the first phase of the game, the player begins in outer space above the Death Star. He must engage in a dog fight with Darth Vader and enemy TIE fighters.<br/><br/>In the second phase (occurring beginning with the second wave), the player reaches the Death Star's surface as laser turrets on towers rise to confront the player. If the player manages to destroy a certain number of turrets, he will receive a sizable point bonus.<br/><br/>In the final phase, the player finds himself speeding through the trench of the Death Star, avoiding obstacles and blasting gun turrets until finally firing a proton torpedo at the correct time for a direct hit on the exhaust port target. What follows, if the player is successful, is the Death Star exploding in a multitude of different colors, plus the awarding of one bonus shield (on factory settings). If the player manages to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything but the exhaust port, he will receive a sizable point bonus for &quot;using the Force.&quot;<br/><br/>The game then resets to the first phase. Each successive Death Star run greatly increases in difficulty; TIE Fighters shoot more often, there are more Laser towers and batteries in the second round, and there are many more obstacles and laser fire during the trench run. Unlike the movie, where the units shoot beams similar to lasers, the enemy units in this game shoot projectiles resembling fireballs, in order to give the player a chance to destroy the fired shots.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Star Wars (1983 video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "76576": {"rpgdesigner": ["Michael T.

After the first turn, they alternate having first choice of where to place. Tiles must touch any edge of at least one tile that is already played, or of a location the opponent has currently chosen.<br/><br/>Hiding the front side from the opponent to conceal the tile's rotation, they position their tiles upright with its edge on the table.

Repeat.<br/><br/>Players attempt to form three target shapes with their own color and the opponent's color.<br/><br/>Look for a Black rock which crushes a White scissors, for instance. The game would immediately end in a victory for Black-- unless a White paper is formed at the exact same time, and covers the Black rock. That's one point for White and one point for Black. In that case, the game continues until one player has at least one more winning shape combination on the board than the other. If the score is still tied when the last tiles are played, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>It is possible for two tiles to be part of multiple shapes.

Life, fraught and terrifying, is best lived without pondering those momentous days hundreds or thousands of years ago. The Chanese have no reliable records of the times and the Kuen-Yuin who lived in that era provide no answers. The simple truth of their life is that to leave the boundaries of the Interdiction is to step into a world teeming with warfare, madness and the desires of black gods. Tsan Chan is the only place humans exist and it is cruel. It must be.<br/><br/>To the scholars of the Empire, the Kuen-Yuin, the Ophidians, matters are rather clearer, although they too suffer frustration concerning the specifics. They were not there; they were hidden in the earth, or cowering in monasteries of Leng, praying to Gods that were abandoning them.<br/><br/>When Cthulhu rose up again, it was the work of humans, some cult, some ancient priesthood making good on its teachings and prophecies. Throughout human history, the inevitability of this release was foretold but the consequences were debated. Some feared it meant destruction, an abattoir-era where the human race and many others were prey and nourishment. Other, were uncertain, believing the Lord of R&rsquo;lyeh would teach men to laugh and revel and kill.<br/><br/>Those in the second camp were the most correct. Cthulhu did rise up again free from his slumber, free to make good on his antique dreams. But his ambitions were not a destroyer nor even, rightly, a conqueror. No, Cthulhu rose as an evangelist, high priest of unknowable, fabulously dangerous gods. And the shock of his presence, the power of his ministry, is today known as the Dream.<br/><br/>As the Old One arose, humanity was psychically damaged beyond repair. Previously, only the most &lsquo;sensitive&rsquo; of souls could perceive the movement and desires of Cthulhu. Unfettered, free to preach, the world itself went insane. No one knows how long it took but soon, terribly soon, after Cthulhu&rsquo;s release, humanity had fallen. Infected by the alien morality of the High Priest, humans became shrieking things, immoral and barbaric, completely without scruple or the faintest notion of consequence. Society and culture fell apart until humanity simply screamed the name of its new King and converted to a blind and idiot religion they could barely comprehend.<br/><br/>Except for a small plateau in China, where precautions had been taken.<br/><br/>"}, "76598": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Roger Halms", "Sandra Halms"], "poll": [], "name": "Tezelle", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic773752_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["High Birches Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic773752.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A tile laying, domino-style game played within the confines of a board using 2x1 oblong shaped thick cardboard tiles of a diamond design utilising seven colours.<br/>The game box contains <br/>4 page rules sheet in 6 languages.<br/>a 48cm square board with 14 x 14 squares thereon onto which the tiles cover 2 adjacent squares.<br/>a pad of score sheets.<br/>4 x cardboard racks for players to display their tiles to them whilst concealing from other players.<br/>a box containing 49 different tiles.<br/><br/>To start the game all the tiles are placed face down on the table and each player selects 8 - 10 tiles [depending upon number of players] and puts them on his/her rack.<br/><br/>The double tiles [coloured triangle the same each end] are numbered 1 - 7 and the player with the lowest numbered double starts the game by placing the tile to cover 2 of the 4 centre squares.<br/><br/>The next player [if wished] matches the end or side of one of his/her tiles and places the tile so that the triangles on the 2 tiles make a coloured square.

It generally requires a genuine CGA card and runs too fast on computers faster than the original IBM PC 4.77 MHz. In an exception to the CGA requirement, it is possible to use a CGA emulator to run Digger on a Hercules graphics card.&quot;<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Many features of Digger are similar to those in the arcade games Mr. Do! and Dig Dug. As in those games, the player is placed in an underground maze, and can dig horizontal and vertical tunnels through it. At least one tunnel already exists at the start of play. At various points on the board are emeralds (usually in clusters) and bags of gold. Monsters (initially in the 'nobbin' form) appear at the top right-hand corner. If earth is excavated from under a gold bag, then the bag will wobble for a few seconds and then drop; if it falls more than one row, it will break open after falling, releasing gold which can be collected. Bags can also be pushed left or right into vertical paths, with similar results. Falling bags will squash monsters that they fall on, but they will also squash the digger. The digger also has a weapon, which will fire in a straight line, but takes several seconds to recharge (taking longer as the levels go higher).<br/><br/>Monsters will sometimes change from the 'nobbin' form to the 'hobbin' form, more frequently on higher levels. Hobbins also have the power to excavate, and can destroy emeralds and gold bags while so doing.<br/><br/>When a monster is killed, another will appear at the top right-hand corner of the screen, up to a maximum number which depends on the level. Once all the monsters for the level have been created, a cherry appears in their place. If the digger collects this, bonus mode is entered, and for about fifteen seconds (which decreases as the game level gets higher) the digger is able to eat the monsters. Accordingly, the monsters now run away from the digger rather than towards it (similar to Pac-Man).<br/><br/>A level ends when all the emeralds are gone or all the monsters have been killed.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Digger (computer game),&quot; available under the  CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "76678": {"videogame": ["Activision Anthology", "Activision Hits Remixed", "Activision's Atari 2600 Action Pack", "A Collection of Activision Classic Games for the Atari 2600"], "poll": [], "name": "Fishing Derby", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Atari 2600 Edition", "Gameroom Windows Edition", "Gameroom Xbox 360 Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971965.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Animals"], "usersrated": "11", "videogamedeveloper": ["Activision"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Atari 2600", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "average": "5.63636", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Activision", "Microsoft Game Studios"], "videogamecompilation": ["Activision Anthology", "Activision Anthology (GBA)", "Activision Anthology (iOS)", "Activision Anthology Remix Edition", "Activision Hits Remixed", "Activision's Atari 2600 Action Pack", "A Collection of Activision Classic Games for the Atari 2600"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic971965_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;In Fishing Derby, two fishermen sit on opposite docks over a lake filled with fish (and a shark that passes through).

It is often referenced as one of the worst video games ever made, a distinction it shares with other Mystique titles, like Custer's Revenge.<br/><br/>In this game, the player controls a pair of nude women who scuttle back and forth underneath a building where a man with a notably large penis is constantly masturbating  from the roof top. The player's objective is to maneuver these women so that they consume the man's semen (which is colored yellow in the game) before it hits the ground. When all the semen is caught, the two women turn to the screen and lick their lips. These game-play mechanics closely mimic those of a large group of games (e.g. Kaboom!) in which the object is to catch objects thrown by an ever-faster moving character. A score of 69 points, and every 69 points thereafter (138, 207, 276, etc.) earns an extra life.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Beat 'Em &amp; Eat 'Em,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "76690": {"videogame": ["Midway Arcade Treasures", "Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play", "Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Volume 1", "Williams Arcade's Greatest Hits"], "poll": [], "name": "Sinistar", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Arcade edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562402.png", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "14", "videogamedeveloper": ["WMS Industries, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "7.23214", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["WMS Industries, Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["Midway Arcade Origins", "Midway Arcade Treasures", "Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play", "Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Volume 1", "Williams Arcade's Greatest Hits"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562402_t.png", "description": "Sinistar is an arcade game released by Williams in 1982.

This player wants to off as many other players as possible before someone catches his murderous wink and accuses him of the crimes.<br/><br/>In Eye for an Eye, the players belong to a group of priests in Britannia known as the Ovates. From the rules: &quot;It is the dream of every Ovate to become a Druid, but the test is a terrible one requiring courage,intelligence and stamina.&quot; One to three Druids hide among the group of Ovates, and they can hypnotize an Ovate by winking at that players. The Druids don't know one another's identities, but if one Druid winks at another, the wink has no effect. The game ends when either only one Ovate remains unhypnotized (this player being the game's loser for failing to detect any Druids after so much opportunity) or an Ovate accuses someone of being a Druid (in which one or the other player is the game's loser). The loser must then perform the tests chosen by players at the start of the game from the included deck of 34 tests, with the test categories being &quot;Gallantry&quot;, &quot;Find Out About Me&quot;, &quot;Don't Be Shy&quot; and &quot;Surprise&quot;.<br/><br/>The Austrlian Wink Death features a more traditional approach to the party game, with one player being the winker and up to 32 others being the winkees. The murder victims die in the manner depicted on their character card. Any player can accuse another of being the winker, but should the accusation prove incorrect, then both players are out and the game continues.

It is set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and uses a strict interpretation of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5 Edition rule set.<br/><br/>In the campaign storyline, players lead a party of adventurers on their quest to investigate an ancient being, about which little beyond the name is initially known. The plot is eventually revealed to be an epic contest between two dragons competing for godhood. The player can choose the path of good or evil, with different quests available depending on which is preferred, although the distinction between the two is not always clear. The game is divided up into a number of distinct battles or missions (30+), with the player able to access the majority of these during a given campaign, since several of the scenarios are mutually exclusive. Scenarios cannot be re-played once successfully completed.<br/><br/>The campaign revolves around a single lead character, with the other characters playing a supporting role. At the start of each scenario or battle, players select which additional adventurers to take along (up to a total of five such auxiliary characters after the first few scenarios). While this technically allows one to have more than six adventurers, only characters who actually participate in a given battle earn experience, so attempting to field a larger stable of cohorts serves to dilute earned experience levels.<br/><br/>The game features the core character classes from the D&amp;D rulebook: the Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, and Wizard, as well as two non-core classes, the Psion and Psychic Warrior.

It was also later ported to other Atari computer and game platforms. It was distinctive for its graphics, which (under most conditions) represented an out-the-cockpit, first-person view from a fictional combat spaceship  traveling through a streaming 3D starfield in pursuit of enemy fighters called &quot;Zylons&quot;. While there had already been simple target-shooting games using this perspective, Star Raiders had considerably higher quality graphics and more complex game play. As a result, it inspired both imitators throughout the 1980s and later-generation &quot;space combat simulation&quot; games such as the Wing Commander and X-Wing series. It is one of the games that inspired the seminal title Elite. It is also one in a series of first person space shooters (including 1977's Starhawk and 1979's Star Fire) that appeared in the late-1970s and were arguably predecessors of the later seen first-person shooter genre. The game's attract mode, a simple streaming star field, was a common sight in computer stores of the early-1980s to show off the Atari computers' graphics capabilities.<br/><br/>The 2600 console version of the game came packed with part 3 of the Atari Force comic series as done by DC Comics.

You do this by causing chains of bombs to explode, sending useless rubble over to your opponent's field, which they must then remove themselves. Bombs are earned by causing chains of three identical blocks to disappear. Bombs can only be blown up with an explosion from a lit bomb, which falls from the top of the screen every so often. If the player causes enough damage, they can eventually earn a giant bomb, which will remove a large amount of debris from the playing field, and cause their opponent a good deal of trouble.<br/><br/>The game's regular story mode revolves around Bomberman's hunt for the Golden Bomber statue. During his trek, he fights against several different odd characters, like Drifty the balloon, or Cecil the tiger. However, all that can really be earned from playing through this mode is a harder difficulty level, earned by finishing the entire story at the &quot;hard&quot; difficulty level.

The player assumes the role of Rex, Bloop, Spike, or Gwen, small T-Rex dinosaurs (with Styracosaurus-like heads) in the land of &quot;Og&quot;, home to the one-eyed cavemen known as the &quot;Trog&quot;. Players must pick up all colored eggs lying around the map as the cavemen wander around, attempting to capture and eat them. Luckily, there are plenty of power-ups to help finish the level. Aside from a standard punch attack, these include red flowers that increase the player's speed, ice cubes that freeze all on-screen Trogs and pineapples, which turn the character into a full-grown T-Rex that can temporarily eat his enemies. The multiplayer mode consists of two to four dinos on the same screen competing to get all of his/her same-colored eggs first, and players can either attack or protect each other (though power-ups indiscriminately hurt anyone that's in the way regardless). Unlike Pac-Man, however, the dinos can attack without requiring a power-up, and the mazes are much more open. In fact, in many stages there are no walls at all, so the characters can travel off the edge of the grid-like islands and plunge into the sea if they're not careful. The Trogs can be one-hit punched, to the side of the head, as they approach the screen edge resulting in them diving into the sea, with bonus points rewarded to the player.<br/><br/>There are three different levels of difficulty: Easy, Advanced and Expert. Advanced Mode rewards a 200,000 level bonus and Expert rewards a 400,000 level bonus. As the levels progress, the cavemen become smarter and invent new ways to capture the dinosaurs. They eventually create fire pits and wheels to burn and flatten, respectively, the character and springs to bounce themselves all over the screen. Catapults and transportation chambers in latter stages help evade these attacks, however these are also usable by the Trogs resulting in some tactical gameplay options.<br/><br/>The Trogs themselves are subject to all hazards the player is; they can even be taken out by their own wheels, fire and pits to comic effect.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Trog!,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "76802": {"poll": [], "name": "Trauma Center: Second Opinion", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European Wii edition", "North American Wii edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic915795.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Trauma Center"], "videogametheme": ["Medical", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "30", "videogamedeveloper": ["Atlus Co.

Kids help their Sketchy by using Living Ink, a unique drawing recognition system to draw one-of-a kind interactive objects that form the centerpiece of the game&rsquo;s action.  There&rsquo;s little chance for the player to lose interest in ItzaBitza. The game provides a totally unique experience every time it is played. Since the environment is created through each player&rsquo;s personal drawings, the possibilities are as endless and fantastic as the player&rsquo;s imagination. The game comes with five themed playsets: Home Sweet Home, Let&rsquo;s go Camping, Play in Space, A Farm Life, and perfect for Halloween, A VERY Scary Haunted House.Players unlock playsets by winning at least five star challenges.<br/><br/>ItzaBitza is more than just a fun game. The game has been crafted specifically for early-readers. In ItzaBitza, players who are just learning to read start out having a blast watching the whimsical reactions happen between their drawings and their Sketchy. Then all of a sudden, they need to read to win a star. Or to know what to draw so they can help their Sketchy. Parents will be delighted by the game&rsquo;s ability to enhance their child&rsquo;s self-confidence. Unlike some games that leave younger players frustrated by their difficulty and lack of assistance, ItzaBitza provides features to guide children even when faced with unfamiliar concepts. If an early-reader encounters a new word, it can be read aloud to them with the simple act of hovering the mouse over the word.<br/><br/>Through a delightful twist on drawing games, ItzaBitza introduces a new way for kids to game and while they are playing, really important learning is happening. New methods to engage children, discovered during a multi-year research project conducted by Microsoft Corporation, are fused into the game&rsquo;s design, yielding a unique experience that encourages fun and learning.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "76815": {"poll": [], "name": "Active Life: Outdoor Challenge", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Wii Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic774959.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Active Life"], "videogametheme": ["Children's"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Bandai Games Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Fitness"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii"], "average": "6.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Bandai Games Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic774959_t.jpg", "description": "[From the back of the case]:<br/><br/>Get off the couch and GET ACTIVE!<br/>Jump into the action with ACTIVE LIFE: Outdoor Challenge!<br/><br/>"}, "76816": {"poll": [], "name": "ItzaZoo", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Children's"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sabi Games, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Educational"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sabi Games, Inc."], "description": "Welcome to the Zoo<br/><br/>What kid doesn&rsquo;t love a trip to the zoo? Roughhousing lions, waddling penguins, playful monkeys and giant polar bears fill a child&rsquo;s eyes with fascinating imagery, but viewing the animals isn&rsquo;t enough to satisfy a child&rsquo;s sense of adventure. Dreams of swinging through the trees with monkeys and swimming with penguins are finally fulfilled when the player enters the world of ItzaZoo. Within this novel drawing game, adorable animals are waiting to accompany the player on their own unique journey through the animal kingdom. The player&rsquo;s drawings become interactive environments where the loving attention given to each animal&rsquo;s mood and circumstance creates a strong bond between your child and the character. For example, inside the polar-bear playset, kids watch a smile appear on the face of the swimming bear as they draw a helpful diving mask for it. Aiding the polar-bear on its underwater adventure is just one of many fun-filled experiences that awaits your child inside ItzaZoo.<br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Five playsets provide homes for a lion, elephant, monkey, turtle and polar bear (the animals can be a boy or a girl depending on your child&rsquo;s preference). The player provides certain objects for each animal that they create by drawing with their mouse on crinkled paper that spins into view. The unique Living-Ink technology recognizes the content of the drawing and brings it to life in a way that will thrill your child. Inside the turtle&rsquo;s playset the player is asked to draw a greenhouse. Once it&rsquo;s complete, your child will be amazed as the turtle wanders into their new home and offers a happy wave. The player can be as creative as they wish since the Living Ink technology adapts to their individual drawing style. Children will laugh as they watch the monkey slip on a peel that moments before was a banana that the player had drawn. Inside the elephant playset, the eager pachyderm balances on a ball drawn by the player. But what happens if they exchange the ball for a triangle, a square or even a star? Observing as the elephant attempts to maintain its balance provides an entertaining lesson on shapes and their interaction with the environment.<br/>Earning Stars uses Creative Problem Solving Skills<br/><br/>Within each playset, the player encounters five Star Challenges. As the player completes the level&rsquo;s challenges they unlock new playsets and further opportunities for fun and learning with the zoo&rsquo;s animals.  Earning stars requires thought and exploration. Each challenge offers the opportunity to use and enhance a player&rsquo;s creative problem solving skills. The challenges vary within each level providing a wide array of fun and educational experiences. In the elephant&rsquo;s playset a star can be earned by watering flowers, but there is work to do before the watering can be completed. The player must draw a rain cloud and fill their watering bucket by making the cloud rain. The player has to make sure they have enough water for all of the flowers. If the bucket is emptied before the task is complete, they must figure out that they need to make it rain again so that they can fill the bucket and complete the task.<br/>Engages Children in Reading<br/><br/>ItzaZoo provides a new approach to developing the literacy of early readers. Players are guided by sentences that appear in speech bubbles above each animal. If a word is unfamiliar to the reader they can find help by mousing over it. The word will turn red and a helpful child&rsquo;s voice will read it aloud. The sentences increase in difficulty and complexity as the player unlocks each new playset. Parents will delight in their child&rsquo;s blossoming self confidence as they watch the player&rsquo;s need for help decrease with each new level.<br/><br/>While forward progress within the game is based on the Star Challenges which all include an encouraging support system for our early-readers, those looking for an extra challenge will find it by trying out our Visitor Challenges. These timed challenges feature a more advanced vocabulary and are more difficult to complete. Player&rsquo;s unlock these special challenges by attracting more visitors to a particular exhibit as they win their Star Challenges. Once a silver trophy is earned for a level the Visitor Challenge is unlocked. These challenges encourage the player to convince their animal to perform amusing actions like dancing with a snowman or slipping on a banana peel. Since these challenges are intended to be a more difficult bonus level, the usual reading assistance isn&rsquo;t available. The player is met with the eye-popping flash of the visitor&rsquo;s camera as they complete each Visitor Challenge. Each challenge earns camera points that provide extra fun and encouragement, but aren&rsquo;t required for continued progress through the game.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "76817": {"poll": [], "name": "Soldier of Fortune", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Commodore version"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Graftgold"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform", "Run-and-gun"], "videogameplatform": ["Commodore 64"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Telecomsoft"], "description": "[From the back of the box]:<br/><br/>Hoardes of mythical and mystical beasts roam your land under the control of the evil mage Krillys.

Trilby's Notes is the most graphically violent of the four games, an effect achieved with an extremely modest pixel-palette.

Eight players each control a single runner on a staggered lane track - special rules apply for 4 to 7 players.<br/><br/>Each runner has fifteen Bid Tokens, totalling 100 points of Stamina, and for each of the eight Turns a Movement Card is exposed to show the Movement permitted for the top bidder, the second highest bidder, and so on. One or more of the tokens are placed face down in front of the player and the bids examined when all players have made up their minds.<br/><br/>The highest bid claims the first Movement shown on the card, the second highest the second, etc, etc. A Tie-Break Card quickly settles the matter between equal bids. The used Bid Tokens are discarded, except for the Zero token which is taken back into the hand (useful to bluff with!) and the next Turn takes place using a new Movement Card.<br/><br/>Some Movement Cards give a significant Movement advantage to the top bidder, others may have the top three positions gaining equal Movement, but the lower bidders are at a definite disadvantage. All 27 Movement Cards are different (eight are dealt randomly for each race), so bidding tactics and bluffing vary with each race.<br/><br/>Four Movement Cards are on display when the race starts, the one used for the first Turn plus the next three Turns, and at each Turn another Movement Card is revealed, so some forward planning is possible - and necessary! And the staggered lanes means that the true position of the runners is not known until they enter the home straight which deliberately adds to the uncertainty.<br/><br/>If heats and/or semi-finals are run half of the unused Stamina can be carried forward to the next round or Final, and in any event unused Stamina can help a runner 'win' a photo finish if runners are level after eight Turns.<br/><br/>Although designed as a multi-player game for eight players the game can be played by as few as four players with the special rules provided.

Each team starts with its own base; team members can independently purchase vehicles and advanced character classes to destroy the enemy base and defend their own base. A match is won when one team destroys the other's base or when one team has more points than the other when the time limit expires. Damaging and destroying enemy units and structures earns points. Some servers allow the 'endgame beacon' option that causes a side to immediately win if that side's 'superweapon' beacon is successfully planted and detonated on a 'beacon pedestal' in the other side's base.

There is a powerful psychedelic colour scheme through the game which added to its flavour.<br/><br/>Strangeloop also had the most advanced inter-action in the game for its time. The things you do or fix in one room had a direct effect in others. This meant deliberately having to move back and forth to open up further rooms in the factory.

Gamers play the role of Julio, a circus performer who aspires to be a world class monster breeder. Players must meet with the circus ringleader on a weekly basis to plan out the next week's course of action: schedule in circus performances, adventuring and training for their monsters.<br/><br/>Although the series has taken a new direction, Monster Rancher EVO features many of the themes of past games. Monster generation (using CD/DVDs, an in-game item, or with other monsters) is done with a female shaman named Nayuta who also plays the role of heroine. Rather than using a shrine to unlock your disks, Nayuta awakens them using a magical monster rebirth dance. She can reseal them in disc stones as well, which replaces the freeze function from older games. While this does not affect monster health it does affect loyalty; over-use can lead to monsters rebelling in the middle of a show.<br/><br/>There is a Monster Market where players can pick up disc stones for free, in case they lack a large collection of their own disks.<br/><br/>Monsters can be combined like previous games, but the parent monsters are not consumed, and are put back in Julio's inventory afterwards. Many monster species make a return, with a few new additions as well, for a total of 25 main breeds. Monsters put on shows using training gadgets, and if the audience enjoys the show, they will throw money at the stage.<br/><br/>Exploration, similar to that of Monster Rancher 4, involves the character going out into the field with his or her monster(s), and defeating stray monsters and a chapter boss to gain anima points, used to gain new monster skills or perform 'union attacks'.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Monster Rancher EVO,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "76964": {"average": "6.5", "videogame": ["Flight Mania", "Jane's Air Superiority Collection", "Ultimate Flight Series IV"], "videogameversion": ["US Windows Edition"], "name": "Jane's F-15", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "vgcharacterversion": ["McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1272028.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Jane's Combat Simulations"], "videogametheme": ["Flight", "War - Modern"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamecharacter": ["McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Origin Systems Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["1998 D.I.C.E.

This is the only penalty in the game.<br/><br/>Icing can also occur, which is when a player shoots the puck the length of the ice from his own defensive zone.<br/><br/>"}, "76996": {"poll": [], "name": "Ladder", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["CP/M edition"], "average": "7", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Yahoo Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["CP/M"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Kaypro Corporation"], "description": "Ladder is a barrel-jumping game (like Donkey Kong) written for the CP/M operating system and made to be operated on the early Kaypro line of luggable computers.<br/> Since the screens on these computers only accept text characters and not rendered graphics, the game uses letters, numbers, and symbols lined up to create walls and platforms, pits/traps, characters, trampolines and goals.<br/> The floors in Ladder are made of equal signs and the ladders themselves are made of capital &quot;H&quot;s stacked on top of each other.
