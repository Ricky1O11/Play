The objective of the game is to rob as many banks as possible while avoiding the police. The player controls a car called the Getaway Car. The car has a limited amount of fuel, which can be refilled by changing cities. Robbing a bank will cause a cop car to appear, as well as another bank. Up to three cars can be present in a city at a time. Cars can be destroyed by dropping dynamite out the tail pipe of the Getaway Car (however, dynamite can also destroy the Getaway Car). The player starts out with four spare cars (lives). Lives are lost by running out of fuel, being hit by dynamite, or hitting a cop car. If the player can rob nine banks in one city, an extra car is earned.<br/><br/>The left and right difficulty switches alter how hard the game is. When the left difficulty switch is set to A, the cop cars are smarter in catching the Getaway Car; when it's set to B, enemy cars move in a more set pattern.

The game is a typical text-based adventure of the mid-1980s and versions are still available on Spectrum Emulators today.<br/><br/>The game is loosely based on the 1983 award-winning children's novel of the same name by Terry Jones. A number of characters and items in the computer game are drawn from the novel, although the plot is completely different. Jones also directed a 1989 movie Erik the Viking.<br/><br/>You are Erik the Viking, and it is your task to find your family, who have been kidnapped by the evil Dogfighters. In the first part of the game, Erik is on the mainland. He makes preparations for sailing, finds his weapons and gathers together a crew, who include Blind Thorkhild, Sven the Strong and Ragnar Forkbeard.<br/><br/>Most of the game is set on the sea, with Erik steering his ship, the Golden Dragon, through the northern seas. He visits a number of different islands to collect the necessary items and meet the necessary characters to rescue his family and win the game. These include an enchantress in a cave hidden in a forest, the wizard Al Kwasarmi on a stone quay, and the enchanter's daughter Freya. The enchanter's study contains a list of the items that Erik needs to complete the game, and Al Kwasarmi makes them into the ribbon that Erik needs to rescue his family.

All the planets and wildspace for a system are contained in a Crystal Sphere. Outside the Crystal Sphere is the Phlogiston, also known as the &quot;flow&quot;. Holes in the Crystal Sphere allow the flow to shine through, appearing as stars on planets. Spelljamming ships cannot enter the Phlogiston.<br/><br/>In the Spelljammer game the player captains a ship and crew. The player can ship goods from planet to planet for a fee, take on simple missions including, delivering people and goods, destroying pirates, and guarding the space lanes. As the player completes missions his character gains reputation points, eventually gaining enough points to be asked to help rid Realmspace of a terrible danger. This mission led to the simple plot in the game.<br/><br/>The game starts the player with a 5th level character. The available classes are: Clerics, Fighters, Paladins, Rangers, Mages, and Thieves. There are three main parts to the game: docked at a planet, in space travel and ship-to-ship combat, and on-board personal combat. When at a planet, various text menus allowed the player to buy and sell cargo, repair and upgrade their ship, buy and sell character equipment, and seek missions. A rudimentary trade system allowed players to make money shipping goods from planet to planet, and some key planets had more options for ship repairs and equipment. In space, the player can travel from planet to planet, or simply point the ship in any direction and go. Real-time ship-to-ship combat using ballistae and catapults takes place in a simple 3D view. The player can steer his ship to aim the weapons at his enemy, and to try to avoid enemy missiles. The occasional meteor storm is a minor hazard while spelljamming.<br/><br/>One little-used feature programmed into the game was the ability to crash your ship into the Crystal Sphere. Normally &quot;space&quot; was shown as black, but if a player was patient and continued towards the Crystal sphere space would turn dark grey, light grey, the stars would spread out, and eventually the ship would crash into the Crystal Sphere.<br/><br/>The player can bring his ship close to the enemy ship, board, and do turn based hand-to-hand combat on a simple isometric map. A full range of spells and weapons is available, and ships are crewed by a wide range of humans and monsters. In the turn-based combat system, the player controls the ship's officers, and the computer controls the regular crew and the enemies.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Spelljammer: Pirates of Realmspace , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79898": {"videogame": ["Time and Magik: The Trilogy"], "poll": [], "name": "The Price of Magik", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK Amstrad CPC edition", "UK Commodore 64 edition", "UK MSX edition", "UK ZX Spectrum edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic906578.png", "videogameseries": ["Time and Magik"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Level 9 Computing"], "videogamegenre": ["Text Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC", "Commodore 64", "MSX"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Level 9 Computing"], "videogamecompilation": ["Time and Magik: The Trilogy"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic906578_t.png", "description": "From the Manual<br/><br/>The Price of Magik recounts the sad tale of Myglar who, driven mad by the intensity of magikal radiance from the Moon Crystal that he had protected for so long, stole it.

It is the eleventh official installment in The King of Fighters series following The King of Fighters 2003, although a spinoff titled The King of Fighters Neowave was previously released for the same platform. A home version for the PlayStation 2 was released in Japan in 2006, followed by releases in the PAL region and North America in 2007.<br/><br/>The four largest innovations KOF XI brings to the franchise are the Quick Shift, the Saving Shift, the Skill Bar and the Dream Cancels. The Power Stocks that existed previously are still present, and are filled in the usual fashion. Nevertheless, there are now Skill Stocks as well, which gradually build up over time. Each team begins a match holding the maximum of two Skill Stocks. Offensive maneuvers, such as Desperation Moves, Guard Cancels, and Tag Attacks, continue to use Power Stocks. However, more defensive or tactical maneuvers, such as Guard Evasion, Saving Shift, and Quick Shift, use Skill Stocks.<br/><br/>KOF XI utilizes the Tactical Shift System from KOF 2003. The Quick Shift allows to change into another character in the middle of any combo, prolonging it, or in the middle of any attack, canceling the frames of animation of the attack, if it's needed. The Saving Shift allows to take out a character when he is being hit as soon as he is hit, at the cost of both skill bars. The last new feature of KOF XI is the Dream Cancel. Like the Super Cancel that first appeared in KOF '99, Dream Cancel allows players to use stocks to interrupt a move in the midst of its execution with a more powerful move, allowing devastating combos.<br/><br/>Should the timer run down in a match, the winner is no longer decided based upon who has the most life remaining. Instead, the judgment bar, a new bar of circular shape composed of two colors, each one representing one player acts as a quantifier of the skill of each player. Whichever player has the judgment bar towards his or her side will be the victor if none of the teams win defeating all three characters from the opposite team; rarely, if the bar is exactly in the center, the match will end in a draw and both sides will lose. The bar is affected by each attack that the players get in, combos affect progressively more, and when a character of the opposing team is defeated, the bar suffers a big change against that player.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, The King of Fighters XI , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79905": {"videogame": ["Adventure Quest", "Colossal Adventure", "Dungeon Adventure"], "poll": [], "name": "Jewels of Darkness", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Amstrad CPC Cassette edition", "English/European Amstrad CPC Floppy Disk edition", "UK Amiga edition", "UK Atari 8-bit edition", "UK Atari ST edition", "UK Commodore 64 Cassette edition", "UK Commodore 64 Disk edition", "UK DOS edition", "UK MSX edition", "UK ZX Spectrum edition", "US Amiga edition", "US Atari 8-bit edition", "US DOS edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1465910.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Level 9 Middle Earth Trilogy"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Level 9 Computing"], "videogamegenre": ["Text Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Amstrad CPC", "Atari 8-bit family", "Atari ST", "Commodore 64", "DOS", "MSX", "ZX Spectrum"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Telecomsoft"], "videogamecompilation": ["Adventure Quest", "Colossal Adventure", "Dungeon Adventure"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1465910_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A collection of three classic adventure games by Level 9 that were in a fantasy setting clearly derived from Middle Earth.<br/><br/>"}, "79906": {"poll": [], "name": "The King of Fighters XII", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["American PS3 Edition", "American Xbox 360 Edition", "European PS3 Edition", "European Xbox 360 Edition", "Japanese Arcade Edition"], "average": "6.5", "videogameseries": ["The King of Fighters"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "videogamefranchise": ["The King of Fighters"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2009 Game Critics Best Fighting Game of the Year Nominee"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Ignition Entertainment", "SNK Corporation"], "description": "The King of Fighters XII is the twelfth installment of The King of Fighters series. SNK Playmore announced that it is abandoning the Atomiswave system and is moving its most popular game franchises to the Taito Type X2 arcade system. KOF XII uses newly-drawn 2D sprites on 2D backgrounds. Due to the time the developers took to make the sprites, there are 20 playable characters (the lowest number of characters ever had in a game from the series). The game was released in Japan in April 2009 for arcades. Home versions of the title for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 (PS3) had a worldwide release in July 28 of the same year. Like The King of Fighters '98 and The King of Fighters 2002, this game does not have a storyline; the saga from Ash Crimson that started in The King of Fighters 2003 will finish in The King of Fighters XIII.<br/><br/>KOF XII uses the usual 3-on-3 team system with each fight consisting of up to five rounds. However, the Tactical Shift System from The King of Fighters 2003 has been removed. KOF XII also introduces the &quot;critical counter&quot; system. During a match, a bar beneath the player's vitality will fill. When it is full and a player lands a close strong punch as a counter, the character enters into a critical counter mode where the player has a short amount of time wherein their character can link multiple attacks together. Once the critical counter's time period has expired the player can finish with a special move. The new &quot;Guard Attack&quot; feature allows a fighter to intercept and hit an incoming opponent's strike damage free (even Desperation Moves can be repelled in this fashion). Finally, there is also a &quot;clash&quot; system in place (called the Sousai or &quot;Deadlock&quot;) wherein characters who land blows on one another with matched timing, the engine will generate a 'break' effect and push the characters away from one another into a neutral standing. As it happened with The King of Fighters '98 and The King of Fighters 2002, the game does not contain a storyline allowing the return of several characters depending on their status in the series. Additionally, there are no official teams, leaving the player to create any team to use. Players can still dash, backstep, and perform rolls as their evade. The Guard Breaks from previous games can now be done at any time.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, The King of Fighters XII , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79907": {"poll": [], "name": "The King of Fighters XIII", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade edition", "Japanese PlayStation 3 edition", "Japanese Xbox 360 edition", "North American PlayStation 3 edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition", "PlayStation 3 PSN edition", "Windows Downloadable Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1201533.jpg", "videogameseries": ["The King of Fighters"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "videogamefranchise": ["The King of Fighters"], "usersrated": "12", "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2011 Spike Best Fighting Game of the Year Nominee", "2012 D.I.C.E.

Additionally, however, he does not want the game to be too similar to its predecessors, though he and his staff's aim for the game is to capture the charm from previous titles.<br/><br/>The game removes some of the gameplay systems used in the previous game; the Guard attack system, the Critical Counter system, the Clash System as well as the dynamic, zooming camera. In their place however, there are new systems that have been confirmed to be added, the first of the three is the new EX Mode, which convert each characters' super moves into more powerful versions that allows one bar from the player's power gauge for EX Special Moves and two bars from the player's power gauge for EX Desperation Moves. Another new addition is Hyper Drive mode, which gives the player unlimited use of Drive Cancels for a while once the Hyper Drive Gauge has been maxed, and the last new feature confirmed for the game is the Drive Cancel system, which opens up new combo possibilities. The game also marks the return of the multi-bar power gauge that was introduced in The King of Fighters '97. In addition to standard and EX Desperation Moves, a new class of Desperation Move entitled &quot;NEO MAX&quot; are included in the game and require that three stocks of gauge be exchanged in order to perform one, making it similar to Hidden Desperation Moves (The King of Fighters 2002) and Leader Desperation Moves (The King of Fighters 2003). These can also be canceled from standard Desperation Moves, making them similar to the &quot;Dream Cancels&quot; from The King of Fighters XI.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, The King of Fighters XIII , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79908": {"videogame": ["SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1"], "poll": [], "name": "The King of Fighters '94", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade Edition", "US Neo Geo AES edition", "US Neo Geo CD edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic834091.jpg", "videogameseries": ["The King of Fighters"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "videogamefranchise": ["The King of Fighters"], "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Neo Geo", "PlayStation 3", "PSP", "Wii"], "usersrated": "3", "average": "6.66667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga", "SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic834091_t.jpg", "description": "The King of Fighters '94 (officially abbreviated KOF '94) is a 1994 fighting game released by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade and home console. It is the inaugural game in The King of Fighters series by the same company. The game was originally ported to the Neo Geo AES and Neo-Geo CD following its original arcade release. In 2004, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the series, SNK released a remake titled The King of Fighters '94 Rebout, which featured the original game and a new version with high definition graphics.<br/><br/>The game is a fictional crossover featuring characters from SNK's previous fighting game properties Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting, as well as revised versions of characters from their pre-Neo Geo games Ikari Warriors and Psycho Soldier, and original characters created specifically for the game. The plot features the creation of a new King of Fighters tournament created by the criminal Rugal Bernstein, but this time with teams composed of three members unlike the ones from Fatal Fury, which had no teams.<br/><br/>SNK developed KOF '94 with the initial idea of using several games from the company in order to attract gamers who played these games. However, they later added original characters not seen in other games to develop a story arc. Video game publications have commented on KOF '94, praising its characters designs as well as the gameplay of using teams of three members. The success of this game allowed SNK to produce a large number of sequels.<br/><br/>The basic gameplay of KOF '94 is similar to SNK's previous games such as the Fatal Fury series, Art of Fighting, and Samurai Shodown. The game uses a four attack button configuration similar to Fatal Fury 2 and Fatal Fury Special consisting of Light Punch, Light Kick, Strong Punch, and Strong Kick. Like in Fatal Fury 2, certain specialized techniques can be performed by pressing certain buttons in combination. Pressing Light Punch and Light Kick simultaneously allows the player to dodge an opponent's attack, while pressing Hard Punch and Hard Kick will perform a character's &quot;Bop Attack&quot;. As with other fighting games, each characters has set of basic, unique, and special moves that can be perform by the player with a specific series of joystick and button inputs.<br/><br/>Each player also has a power gauge at the bottom of the screen which can be filled up by pressing and holding three buttons (LP+LK+SP) at the same time, leaving the character vulnerable to an attack while charging. Once the power gauge is filled, the player's basic attacks become stronger for a short period. When the player is in this state, they can also perform their character's &quot;Super Special Move&quot;, which will immediately consume the entire Power Gauge. The player can also perform their character's Super move when their life gauge is 75% empty and flashing red like in Fatal Fury 2.<br/><br/>Instead of the traditional round-based format used in preceding fighting games, KOF '94 features a format consisting of 3-on-3 team based matches officially dubbed the Team Battle System. Instead of choosing a single character, the player selects from one of eight available teams, each representing a different nation (U.S.A., Brazil, Mexico, England, Italy, China, Korea, and Japan), each consisting of three members. Before each the match, the player and the opponent will then choose the order in which each member will enter battle. When the match begins, the members chosen to go first on each team will fight. When one character is defeated, the following member of the same team will take his place, while the character on the other team will have a small portion of their life restored (if energy was lost during the previous round). If a character is losing a match against the opponent, then the player can call one of their remaining teammates standing on the sidelines to jump in and attack the opponent. The match will end when all three members of either team loses.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, The King of Fighters %2794 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79909": {"poll": [], "name": "The King of Fighters '95", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade edition", "North American Game Boy edition", "North American Neo Geo AES edition", "North American Neo Geo CD edition", "North American PlayStation edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic801021.jpg", "videogameseries": ["The King of Fighters"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "videogamefranchise": ["The King of Fighters"], "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Game Boy", "Neo Geo", "PlayStation"], "usersrated": "4", "average": "6.8125", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd.", "SNK Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic801021_t.jpg", "description": "The King of Fighters '95 is a 1995 fighting game produced by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade and home console. It is the sequel to The King of Fighters '94 and the second game in The King of Fighters series. It is also the first game in the series to be ported to other home consoles besides the Neo Geo AES and Neo-Geo CD, with versions released for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Game Boy. It was also rereleased in The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga in 2008 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii.<br/><br/>The game features a similar cast to KOF '94 with the exception of the USA Team, which was replaced by the Rival Team. The plot features a new King of Fighters tournament once again promoted by the criminal Rugal Bernstein, who wants to take revenge against Kyo Kusanagi, who defeated him in last year's tournament. The game also introduces a sub-boss character, Saisyu Kusanagi, who is the father of Kyo. 'KOF '95' also introduces the fighter Iori Yagami, who becomes Kyo's rival in the series.<br/><br/>One of the main focuses in the creation of The King of Fighters '95 was the introduction of the Rivals Team, most notably Iori, who became one of the favourite characters from the staff. The game has received mixed reviews from various video games publications. Most writers have complained about the response from controls and long loading times from the PlayStation port. However, the introduction from the enhanced version of Rugal, Omega Rugal, as well as the differences between all the characters have been noted to be one of the best parts from the game.<br/><br/>The gameplay and rules are mostly unchanged from The King of Fighters '94. The main addition is the introduction of the Team Edit feature, allowing the player to create a custom team from any of the game's 24 characters in addition to the pre-defined teams in the game. Through the main play mode, players must defeat all of the teams from the game in order to fight the bosses: the brainwashed Saisyu Kusanagi, followed by a stronger Rugal Bernstein.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, The King of Fighters %2795 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79910": {"poll": [], "name": "Slayer", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US 3DO edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Lion Entertainment"], "videogamefranchise": ["Dungeons & Dragons"], "videogameplatform": ["3DO"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Strategic Simulations, Inc."], "description": "Back of box<br/><br/>IT'S TIME YOU DID SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE MONSTERS UNDER YOUR BED.<br/>You're not a helpless kid any more.

It is the third game in The King of Fighters series, following The King of Fighters '95. Like its predecessor, the game was ported to the Neo Geo CD, as well as the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Unlike the previous game, the PlayStation and Saturn versions were released only in Japan, with a language setting allowing the player to set the game to English. It is also part of the compilation The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii.<br/><br/>The game made a few changes to gameplay such as new techniques, various changes of some teams, with a few of them introducing new characters. The plot follows a new King of Fighters tournament created by Chizuru Kagura, the heir of Yata Clan who wants to find and recruit Kyo Kusanagi: the one who defeated the previous KOF host, Rugal Bernstein, to ask him and his bitter rival, Iori Yagami to help her in the sealing of the Orochi demon. The new boss is one of the servants from Orochi, Goenitz, who appears after Chizuru is defeated.<br/><br/>SNK members had various troubles with the development of the game as they were dragged on right up to the time of its scheduled release. This happened since developers had diffulties with making the sprites and special moves of new characters from the game. The game has had mixed reviews from several video games publications. While some reviewers have praised the graphical improvements and the addition of new characters, some have commented it was unbalanced in comparison to its prequels.<br/><br/>KOF '96 made a few slight changes to the gameplay of previous KOF games by introducing new techniques. The Dodge technique from the previous two game is replaced by an &quot;emergency evasion&quot; or &quot;attack deflector&quot; technique, which allows the player's character to roll away or towards the opponent. In the latter case, the player can have the ability to roll towards the opponent and end up at the other side. The player can also determine the height of their jump and perform small or high jumps. Additionally, the graphics for all the character sprites from the previous games were redrawn and the commands for certain Special and Super moves were changed from previous games. Like in the previous, Super Special Moves can be perform when the Power Gauge is filled up or when the player's life gauge is flashing red. However, the player can also perform a more powerful version of their regular Super move if both conditions are met (the player has low energy and Maximum level power gauge).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, The King of Fighters %2796 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79912": {"poll": [], "name": "The King of Fighters '97", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade Edition", "US Neo Geo AES edition", "US Neo Geo CD edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic801024.jpg", "videogameseries": ["The King of Fighters"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "videogamefranchise": ["The King of Fighters"], "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Neo Geo"], "usersrated": "3", "average": "6.66667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic801024_t.jpg", "description": "The King of Fighters '97 is a 1997 fighting game produced by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade and home console.

The Saturn requires the same 1MB RAM cartridge utilized by the previous game.<br/><br/>KOF '97 follows the same format as the previous KOF games, but introduces two distinct playing styles which the player can select before choosing their team: Advance and Extra.<br/><br/>Advance mode is based on the previous game in the series, KOF '96, but features a revamped Power Gauge. Instead of charging the Power Gauge, the Power Gauge is now filled whenever the player strikes the opponent or by performing Special Moves. The player can stock up to three Power Gauges. The player can use one stock of the Power Gauge to perform a Super Special Move or enter a &quot;MAX&quot; mode, in which the player's defensive and offensive strength are increased. Performing a Super Special Move while in MAX mode will make the player perform a more powerful Super Special Move.<br/><br/>Extra mode is based on the first two games in the series, KOF '94 and KOF '95. Like in those games, the player fills the Power Gauge by charging it or defending against the opponent's attacks. After the gauge is filled, the player enters MAX mode and like in Advance, their character's offense and defense will increase.

A Dreamcast version also released titled The King of Fighters: Dream Match 1999, which featured much of the stages remade in 3D. The game was also remade for the PlayStation 2 under the name of The King of Fighters '98: Ultimate Match which expanded the number of playable characters.<br/><br/>As KOF '98 did not feature a storyline, the SNK staff took this opportunity to add Rugal (who died in KOF '95) as well as various alternate versions from various characters to the game.

The game introduces several changes to the established KOF format, as well as a new story arc that would later be dubbed the &quot;NESTS Chronicles&quot;.<br/><br/>Instead of the three character teams from previous KOF games, each team now has four members. Before a match, the player chooses three of the characters to use in the actual fights, while the fourth member becomes the designated &quot;Striker&quot;, a character the player summons during battle to help their character out by performing one of their Special Moves against the opponent.

It was the first game SNK Playmore produced for the Atomiswave. Although a part of The King of Fighters series, it is not counted in the numeral progression established in the following game in the series, The King of Fighters XI (with KOF 2003 being the actual tenth game in the series). The game was ported to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The PS2 version was released only in Japan and the PAL region, while the Xbox version was the only home version released in North America. The character artwork was done by Tomokazu Nakano (of Power Instinct fame).<br/><br/>The game reverts back to the 3-character elimination system from KOF '94 to KOF '98, ignoring gameplay features from later games such as the &quot;Striker&quot; system used from KOF '99 through KOF 2001 and tag team system in KOF 2003. The game's graphics consist of 2D character sprites overlaid over polygonal 3D backgrounds (similar to the 3D stages featured in the console versions of previous games in the series such as the Dreamcast versions of KOF '98).<br/><br/>With the change of hardware from Neo Geo to Atomiswave, the number of buttons is now increased to five. In addition to the standard four attack buttons used in the previous games, a fifth button is now added which is used to activate the Heat Mode. Heat Mode will cause the character to blink red and increase their offensive strength, with the side effect being that the character's health will begin to gradually decrease. The player will return to normal after getting hit by the opponent or by pressing Heat Mode button again to deactivate it, and the player must wait awhile to activate it again. The player cannot use Heat Mode when the life gauge is in critical level.<br/><br/>The player can select their own playing style similar to KOF '97 and KOF '98, from three different styles, which affects the techniques available to the player and the length of their Power Gauge.<br/><br/>In Super Cancel Mode (SC Mode), the player has a three stock Power Gauge. The player can use Super Special Moves (which requires one Power Gauge stock) and MAX Super Special Moves (which requires two). With one Power stock, the player can cancel a regular move into a Special or Super Special move, and a regular Special into a Super Special. The player can also use one Power stock to cancel a guard into a Knockdown Blow or an Emergency Escape, or do a Quick Emergency Escape during a normal or command move.<br/><br/>In Guard Break Mode (GB Mode) , the player has a two stock Power Gauge. Like in SC Mode, the player can perform Super Special (one stock) and MAX Super Special Moves (two stock). The player can parry an opponent's attack using the &quot;Just Defend&quot; technique, guarding against an opponent's attacks at the precise moment it makes contact with the character, allowing the player to follow it up with a counterattack. Using one Power stock, the player can guard cancel into an Emergency Escape or do a Quick Emergency Escape. The player can also perform a Guard Break attack with one Power stock, which is an unblockable version of a character's Knockdown Attack.<br/><br/>In MAX2 Mode (M2 Mode), the player has a single stock Power Gauge. The player can perform Super Special Moves with one stock, as well as MAX Super Special Moves. However, MAX moves can only be perform when the player has only 25% of their life gauge remaining. Additionally, an exclusive MAX2 move can be perform as well under these conditions as well.

An enhanced version was released for Xbox and PlayStation 2 under the title KOF: Maximum Impact &mdash; Maniax. Marketed as a spinoff of SNK's major fighting series The King of Fighters, from whence many of its characters originate, KOF: Maximum Impact also contains elements of the Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting series. KOF: Maximum Impact is the first 3D fighter made by SNK since 1999's Samurai Shodown: Warriors Rage for the PlayStation. The game was followed by KOF: Maximum Impact 2.<br/><br/>While the version released in the U.S. featured an English dub that was met with much derision (with IGN's Jeremy Dunham going so far as to label it &quot;piss poor&quot; ), further releases for the Xbox and European PS2 add a choice of English and Japanese language options. The Xbox version also includes an online match mode where matches can be fought between players via Xbox Live.<br/><br/>Unlike the 2D games from the series, Maximum Impact breaks the team system, causing all the fighters to fight alone. The story mode is experienced as a single character through the Mephistopheles Fighting Tournament. For most characters, this consists of fighting six characters, with Duke's cronie / Consigliere Hyena announcing the next opponent between matches. For the final match, one faces Duke himself. For a few &quot;featured&quot; characters (Alba Meira, Soiree Meira, and Lien Neville), the story is more intricate and fleshed out.<br/><br/>In Versus Mode, a single match (be it a one-on-one fight or a 3 vs. 3 battle) is fought against either the computer or another player.

Fatal Fury was SNK's first fighting game for the Neo Geo system and served as the inaugural game in their Fatal Fury series, as well as the first game to depict the fictional &quot;King of Fighters&quot; tournament (which became the basis for the later The King of Fighters games). Many of SNK's mainstay characters, including the Bogard brothers Terry and Andy, and their arch-nemesis Geese Howard, made their debut in this game.<br/><br/>The gameplay follows the typical formula of most fighting games: the player competes against their opponent in best two-out-of-three matches. The play controls consists of an eight directional joystick and three attack buttons: punch, kick and throw. each of the playable character has special techniques that are performed by inputting specific commands and combination with the joystick and buttons. The input methods for special moves are shown to the player during the course of the game (after every bonus round), as opposed to being given in an instruction card in the game's cabinet.<br/><br/>The most novel aspect of Fatal Fury were the addition of two-line battles. Many stages featured two lines, a background line and a foreground line. However, only the CPU-controlled character can change between lines freely. The player can only change lines after the computer has done so, in this case they can simply roll to the adjacent line or jump towards the opponent with a line attack.<br/><br/>When a second player joins during the middle of a one player fight, instead of postponing the current battle for a match between the two players, the game will make both players team-up against the current CPU opponent in a two-on-one match before their battle takes place.<br/><br/>After every second match in the single player tournament, the player will participate in a bonus round mini-game involving an arm wrestling match against a machine. The player must tap the A button rapidly to win these mini-games.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Fatal Fury: King of Fighters , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79920": {"videogame": ["Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1"], "poll": [], "name": "Fatal Fury 2", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade edition", "Australian Genesis edition", "English/European Mega Drive edition", "Japanese Game Boy edition", "North American Genesis edition", "North American Neo Geo edition", "North American SNES edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1041820.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Fatal Fury"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation", "Takara"], "videogamefranchise": ["Fatal Fury"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Game Boy", "Neo Geo", "SEGA Genesis", "SNES"], "usersrated": "5", "average": "7.4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation", "Takara"], "videogamecompilation": ["Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1041820_t.jpg", "description": "Fatal Fury 2 (\u9913\u72fc\u4f1d\u8aac\uff12 \uff5e\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u95d8\u3044\uff5e Gar\u014d Densetsu 2 Aratanaru Tatakai, &quot;Legend of the Hungry Wolf 2: The New Battle&quot;) is a 1992 fighting game released by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade and home platforms. It is the sequel to Fatal Fury: King of Fighters and the second game in the Fatal Fury franchise.<br/><br/>Fatal Fury 2 was the second game in SNK's 100-Mega Shock series, offering improved graphics and gameplay over the original Fatal Fury. The play controls were modified, this time making full use of the Neo-Geo's four button configuration, by including four attack buttons (Light Punch, Light Kick, Strong Punch, and Strong Kick). The player can also dash towards the opponent or retreat by pushing the lever right or left twice.<br/><br/>The two line battles from the first Fatal Fury has been retained. This time, the player can change freely between either lines by pressing the Light Punch and Light Kick buttons simultaneously for the Line Move. The player can also perform a Super Power Attack that will knock the opponent to the other line. When the opponent is another line, the player can press either punch button to jump towards the opponent with a Low Light Move Attack or either kick button for a High Line Move Attack. Certain stages have hazards in the background line, such as electrified wires or a stampede of bulls, and thus the player cannot change lines, but can knock the opponent to the other line, causing extra damage.<br/><br/>Other specialized techniques have been added as well. After the player guards an opponent's attack, they follow it up with a special counterattack technique known as an Evasion Attack. The player can also taunt the opponent by pressing the Hard Punch button from a distance. Fatal Fury 2 also introduces Super Special Moves, a powerful type of Special Moves that can only be used when the player's life gauge is at 25% and flashing red.<br/><br/>The single-player mode has the player facing against all eight characters (including a clone of the player's character), followed by four computer-only boss characters.

It is the fourth game in the Fatal Fury series after Fatal Fury Special (which itself was an updated version of Fatal Fury 2). Console versions of Fatal Fury 3 were released for the Neo Geo CD, Sega Saturn and Windows 95-based computers. The game is also included in the compilation Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1 for the PlayStation 2.<br/><br/>Fatal Fury 3 retains the format and controls of the previous game in the series, Fatal Fury Special. However, the two-plane battle stages have been revamped into a three plane format known as the Oversway System. The player fights primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or &quot;oversway&quot; into either of the sway lines at the background (LP+LK) or foreground (LK+HP). When the player performs an attack in a sway plane (or an Oversway Attack), their character will return to the main plane. Likewise, the player can attack an opponent who is in a Sway Plane with an Anti-Oversway Attack. The player can also do a &quot;Quick Sway&quot; to avoid an attack, leaving the opponent vulnerable to a regular attack.<br/><br/>Other new techniques introduced in this installment includes controlling the height of the character's jump, block an opponent's attack at mid-air (Air Guard), and a new type of combo techniques known as Combination Arts, allowing the player to cancel a specific series (which varies between characters) of regular attacks from one to the other. In addition to the regular Special Moves, and the Super Special Moves which can only be performed when the life gauge is flashing red, each character also has a &quot;Hidden Ability&quot;, which is a stronger version of a Super Special Move. A Hidden Ability occurs once in every 1024 chances whenever the player inputs the command for the character's Super Special Move. A Hidden Ability can also be used by activating &quot;Super Mode&quot; before a match using a secret code. The player then enters a specific command for the Hidden Ability when the life gauge is flashing red. Unlike Super Special Moves, a Hidden Ability can only be used once per round.<br/><br/>Fatal Fury 3 also features a Fighting Level system when fighting against the computer. When the player completes a round, their performance is graded from A to triple S. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the single player mode is determined the by the player's average. The player will have a choice between four characters as their first opponent (Joe, Mary, Bob and Franco). After the first four opponents are defeated, the player will fight against Ryuji Yamazaki for a plot-based match in which the player must win only one round. The player will then proceed to fight against Mai, Andy, Hon-Fu, Sokaku, Terry and Geese in that order, before Yamazaki again for a full match. Depending on the grade average, the game will end against Yamazaki, or the player will fight against either, or both, of the Jin twins.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79924": {"videogame": ["Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 2"], "poll": [], "name": "Real Bout Fatal Fury", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561362.png", "videogameseries": ["Real Bout Fatal Fury"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamefranchise": ["Fatal Fury"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "usersrated": "2", "average": "6.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 2"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561362_t.png", "description": "Real Bout Fatal Fury is a 1995 fighting game released by SNK for the Neo-Geo arcade and home platforms. It is the fifth installment in the Fatal Fury series, following Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory. Ports of Real Bout were released for the Neo-Geo CD, PlayStation (in Japan and the PAL region) and the Sega Saturn (which requires SNK's 1MB RAM cartridge for the system). The game was later included in Fatal Fury Battle Archives Vol. 2, a compilation released for the PlayStation 2.<br/><br/>Real Bout changes the play controls from the previous Fatal Fury games, reducing the number of attack buttons from four to three: a standard Punch and Kick button, a &quot;Strong Attack&quot; button which can be either, a stronger punch or kick attack, depending on the character. The game retains the three-plane &quot;oversway&quot; system from Fatal Fury 3, which features a main lane for fighting, with foreground and background planes used to avoid attacks or leap towards the opponent. A dedicated button is now used to make an &quot;oversway&quot; (or change plane) towards the background or foreground.<br/><br/>Real Bout introduces a Power Gauge which fills up as player performs normal or special techniques against their opponent or defend themselves, similar to many super move gauges featured in other fighting games. The Power Gauge allows players to perform one of three types of Special Techniques, depending of the level of the Power Gauge.<br/><br/><br/>     When the gauge is at least half-full and colored yellow, the player can perform &quot;Guard Cancels&quot;, which are special counterattacks that can be performed by the player after blocking an opponent's attack. They do not consume any filled portion of the Power Gauge.<br/>     When the Power Gauge reaches MAX level while the player still has more than half of his life gauge remaining, then the Power Gauge will enter &quot;S. Power&quot; level. The energy in the Power Gauge will begin to deplete gradually and during that time, the player can perform &quot;Guard Cancels or a &quot;Super Special Move&quot; (a powerful Special Move). However, once a Super Special Move is performed, the remaining energy in the Power Gauge will be consumed and the Power Gauge will return to its initial state.<br/>     When the Power Gauge reaches MAX level while the player has less than half of his life gauge remaining (when the life gauge is flashing red), the Power Gauge will enter &quot;P. Power&quot; level. In this state, the Power Gauge will gradually drain, but the player can perform both, Guard Cancels and Super Specials, indefinitely until the gauge runs out. The player can also perform a &quot;Hidden Ability&quot;, an even more powerful Special Move (several to the Hidden Abilities in previous game), which will consume the remaining Power Gauge at this state.<br/><br/><br/>Real Bout also introduces stages with ring-outs, a gameplay feature previous introduced in 3D fighting games such as Virtua Fighter. If the player performs certain attacks on their opponent while next to the boundaries, the character will eventually destroy the barrier keeping the opponent in the ring and be able to knock them out of the stage for an easy win.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Real Bout Fatal Fury , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79925": {"videogame": ["Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 2"], "poll": [], "name": "Real Bout Fatal Fury Special", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade Edition", "US Arcade Release"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561364.png", "videogameseries": ["Real Bout Fatal Fury"], "videogametheme": ["Martial Arts"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamefranchise": ["Fatal Fury"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 2"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561364_t.png", "description": "Real Bout Fatal Fury Special is a 1997 fighting game released by SNK for the Neo Geo platform.

The game was re-released as a downloadable game for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable via PlayStation Network in Japan on April 25, 2007.<br/><br/>The game re-tells the story of the original Fatal Fury video game.

It is known for pushing the graphical capabilities of the Neo Geo as well as its well-balanced roster of characters and highly technical gameplay.<br/><br/>The two-plane system in which characters would fight from two different planes was removed from the game. The game introduces the &quot;Tactical Offense Position&quot; (T.O.P.) which is a special area on the life gauge.

In contrast to other fighting games at the time which were set in modern times and focused primarily on hand-to-hand combat, Samurai Shodown is set in feudal-era Japan and was one of the first fighting games to focus primarily on weapon-based combat.<br/><br/>The game is set in the late 18th century and all the characters wield weapons. The game uses comparatively authentic music from the time period, rife with sounds of traditional Japanese instruments, such as the shakuhachi and shamisen, and a refined version of the camera zoom first found in Art of Fighting. True to its use of bladed weapons, the game also included copious amounts of blood.<br/><br/>The game quickly became renowned for its fast pace, focused more on quick, powerful strikes than the combos. As to emphasize the distinction of this gameplay system, slow motion was added to intensify damage dealt from hard hits. Also during a match, a referee held flags representing each player (player 1 was white; player 2 red). When a player landed a successful hit, the referee would lift the corresponding flag, letting everyone watching know who dealt the blow. To lessen the repetition of fights, a delivery man running in the background threw items such as chicken (that healed) or bombs, which could significantly change the outcome of a play.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Samurai Shodown , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79933": {"videogame": ["Samurai Shodown Anthology"], "poll": [], "name": "Samurai Shodown II", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iPad/iPhone edition", "Japanese Arcade Edition", "US Neo Geo AES edition", "US Neo Geo CD edition", "Wii Virtual Console (Neo Geo) edition", "XBLA Version"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1113286.png", "videogameseries": ["Samurai Shodown"], "videogametheme": ["Alternate Historical", "Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "19", "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "Arcade", "iPad", "iPhone", "Neo Geo", "Wii", "Xbox 360"], "average": "7.48684", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["Samurai Shodown Anthology"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1113286_t.png", "description": "Samurai Shodown II (\u771f SAMURAI SPIRITS \u8987\u738b\u4e38\u5730\u7344\u5909 Shin Samurai Spirits Ha\u014dmaru Jigokuhen, lit. &quot;True Samurai Spirits - Haohmaru's Portrait of Hell&quot;), is the second game in SNK's popular Samurai Shodown series of versus fighting games. This game has been released on the Wii's Virtual Console in Europe on August 8, 2008 and in North America on August 25, 2008 at a cost of 900 Wii Points. It also been released on Xbox 360 for Xbox Live Arcade on September 10, 2008.<br/><br/>Following up on the extremely enthusiastic fan reception of the first SS game, SNK rebuilt the sequel from the ground up, including almost all of its predecessor's cast, adding several new characters, and refining the overall gameplay with more responsive control, more moves (particularly the use of the POW meter as a finishing-move meter), and a substantial number of Easter eggs.<br/><br/>The cast of characters was expanded to include the following new additions:<br/><br/><br/>     Genjuro Kibagami, who was to become Haohmaru's greatest rival.<br/>     Cham Cham, a young, catlike girl who was the younger sister of Tam Tam (who was excluded from the game).<br/>     Neinhalt Sieger, a knight from Prussia, who fights with a giant, gun-containing gauntlet.<br/>     Nicotine Caffeine, an old, diminutive monk, and master of Haohmaru and Genjuro both.<br/>     Kuroko, the hidden boss of the game, is playable for the first time. Kuroko's movelist is interesting as he uses moves that are used by some of the characters in the game as well as characters from other SNK fighters such as Ryo Sakazaki. His super move in the game is a comical version of Ryo's Ryuko Ranbu.<br/>     Rashojin Mizuki, the first female final boss in the series and the only boss to have assistance from an animal.<br/><br/><br/>The overall gameplay was expanded to include several movement options, such as being able to roll forward and backward, ducking to avoid high attacks, or doing small hops to avoid low strikes. This game was also the first game to incorporate an offensive blocking technique or &quot;parry&quot;, via a command issued at the last second, a player would be able to deflect the incoming attack and leave their adversary open to attack by a split second. Such a technique was later also used in Namco's Weaponlord and later popularized by Capcom's Street Fighter III. There are also cameo appearances from other SNK characters, a hidden boss who would occasionally come out to challenge players, and several other treats for fans to uncover.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Samurai Shodown II , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79934": {"videogame": ["Samurai Shodown Anthology"], "poll": [], "name": "Samurai Shodown III", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade Edition", "US Neo Geo AES edition", "US Neo Geo CD edition", "Wii Virtual Console edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562299.png", "videogameseries": ["Samurai Shodown"], "videogametheme": ["Alternate Historical", "Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Neo Geo", "Wii"], "average": "7.25", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["Samurai Shodown Anthology"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562299_t.png", "description": "Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood, known as Samurai Spirits: Peerless Blade of Zankuro (\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4 \u65ac\u7d05\u90ce\u7121\u53cc\u5263 Samurai Supirittsu Zankur\u014d Mus\u014dken) in Japan and Fighters Swords in Korea, is the third game in SNK's popular Samurai Shodown series of fighting games for the Neo Geo. While it is the third game in the main series, it is the first part of a two-chapter interquel between Samurai Shodown and Samurai Shodown II.<br/><br/>In keeping with their habit of using the third game in a series as a place to wipe the slate clean and start fresh, Samurai Shodown III was to be the start of a bold new direction for the franchise.<br/><br/>The most obvious difference between this game and the others in the series is the notably darker aesthetic. The more light-hearted characters (Earthquake, Cham Cham, and Gen-an to name a few) from the previous games have been excised, and even the kabuki master, Kyoshiro Senryo, received a redesign, transforming him from a flamboyant stage performer into a grim-faced, muscular man. All of the characters have been completely redrawn. The animation is very smooth for all characters, another departure from the graphical style of the second game.<br/><br/>Perhaps most significant, Haohmaru's role in the story was diminished, in favor of the new main character, and the overall story was smaller in scope.<br/><br/>In spite of the removal of several characters, new ones were added in their place. The new additions to the series included the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Shiro Tokisada Amakusa, while not a new character to the series, was now playable, and not a boss.<br/>     Shizumaru Hisame, the semi-amnesiac, umbrella-wielding young boy, who was the focus of the game's story.<br/>     Rimururu, Nakoruru's younger sister, who wielded the power of ice.<br/>     Gaira Caffeine, the large, brash and overbearing monk... who happens to be the nephew of Nicotine Caffeine (in the Korean language setting, Gaira's name changes to &quot;Kim Ung Che&quot;, which is spoken by a different announcer).<br/>     Basara Kubikiri, an undead spirit, seeking revenge for his own murder, and that of his lover.<br/>     Zankuro Minazuki, the new final boss of the game. He is a giant of a man, and a swordsman driven insane by his quest to perfect his skills. His murderous rampage sets the stage for everything else that occurs.<br/><br/><br/>Along with the aesthetic overhaul came significant changes in the gameplay. The most obvious was the addition of two selectable versions of each character.<br/><br/><br/>     Slash: Known to the Japanese as Shura (\u4fee\u7f85), which means &quot;fighting&quot; or a &quot;scene of carnage&quot;, and occasionally mistranslated as &quot;Chivalry,&quot; and implies a regular fighter (compare a face in professional wrestling). This version tended to be the closest in style and moves to the Samurai Shodown II version of the character.<br/>     Bust: Known to the Japanese as Rasetsu (\u7f85\u5239), which is a derivation of the Sanskrit word, &quot;rakshasa,&quot; in reference to a type of demon. It is occasionally mistranslated as &quot;Treachery,&quot; implying a rulebreaking heel version of the character. This version typically differed considerably from its Slash counterpart in gameplay, though it visually did not look different beyond its color palette. The fighter Nakoruru is the only notable exception to this. The &quot;Slash&quot; version of her character is accompanied by her pet hawk, Mamahaha, as in the two previous SS games. Her &quot;Bust&quot; version, however, is accompanied by her pet wolf, Shikuru. (Like with Mamahaha, she is able to hop onto Shikuruu's back and perform modified attacks.) Galford in his &quot;Bust&quot; version fights without his dog, Poppy for the first time in the game.<br/><br/><br/>Also, the button layout was changed, mapping the first three of the four available buttons to weak, medium and strong slash attacks, respectively. The fourth button was used for kick attacks, presumably to de-emphasize kicks in favor of the sword strikes. Though controversial at first, this change was gradually accepted by the fanbase.<br/><br/>The pace of the game had shifted somewhat, as many basic attacks could now be cancelled into special moves, something which was extremely rare in the first two installments. Most of SS2's movement options had been removed, in favor of the ability to dodge attacks by pressing the A and B buttons simultaneously. When close, performing this command would result in a quick switch-around to the opponent's back, which could then be followed up by other attacks. It was also possible to block attacks in mid-air. Items were also thrown onto the battlefield from off-screen as opposed from a delivery man running in the background.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Samurai Shodown III , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79935": {"videogame": ["Samurai Shodown Anthology"], "poll": [], "name": "Samurai Shodown IV", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade Edition", "Japanese Saturn edition", "North American Neo Geo AES edition", "North American Neo Geo CD edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562300.png", "videogameseries": ["Samurai Shodown"], "videogametheme": ["Alternate Historical", "Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Neo Geo", "SEGA Saturn"], "average": "7.66667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["Samurai Shodown Anthology"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562300_t.png", "description": "Samurai Shodown IV: Amakusa's Revenge, known as Samurai Spirits: Amakusa's Descent (\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4\u5929\u8349\u964d\u81e8 Samurai Supirittsu Amakusa K\u014drin, TenSamu in short) in Japan, is the fourth in SNK's flagship Samurai Shodown series of fighting games. Chronologically, is the second and final chapter of an interquel between Samurai Shodown and Samurai Shodown II, Samurai Shodown III being the first chapter.<br/><br/>After Samurai Shodown III was received more or less poorly by the fighting game community, SNK again went back to address the complaints, and tried to deliver a followup that would hopefully regain some of the magic that had made Samurai Shodown II such a hit.<br/><br/>The most obvious change is visual, with dramatically adjusted color palettes for the individual characters, generally brightening them up and reducing contrast, in the attempt to make the game more cartoonish. Aerial blocking was removed entirely, and the switcharound move, which enabled a player to shift quickly behind the other's back, as well as the dodge (Evade; side-step), in which the move virtually brings a semi-3D environment to the defense in attempt to use each sword more effectively.<br/><br/>Following the same philosophy, some of the older characters were restored, such as Charlotte, Tam Tam and Jubei Yagyu. The entire cast of the previous game also returns, though some have been retouched to further enhance the cartoonish look.<br/><br/>Joining the cast were the two ninja brothers:<br/><br/><br/>     Kazuki Kazama - member of the Kazama ninja clan specializing in fire jutsu, he deserts to rescue his younger sister, Hazuki, from Amakusa's clutches.<br/>     Sogetsu Kazama - older brother to Kazuki and Hazuki who uses water jutsu; unlike Kazuki, he stays with the clan and is ordered to assassinate his brother for leaving.<br/><br/><br/>Overall, the game plays not terribly unlike SS3, but the feel is considerably different. Control has been loosened and more accurately modified, controller motions have been improved, overall damage has been reduced and one can no longer charge his/her own POW gauge. The off-screen delivery man was omitted entirely from the game. The biggest addition is probably the &quot;CD Combo,&quot; wherein a player can press the C and D buttons together, triggering a strike that can be followed up by a sequence of button taps. The single-player mode now has a timer, as well. Only by reaching the final boss within a specified time limit can one see a character's ending.<br/><br/>In a slightly paradoxical move when compared to the brighter aesthetic, SNK also added in a &quot;suicide&quot; move (known in English-speaking fan circles as the &quot;Honorable Death&quot;), wherein one's character sacrifices his/her own life, thus forfeiting the round. The bonus to this is that the one committing suicide will start the next round with a full POW gauge. Certain finishes will also enable a &quot;fatality&quot; move in the vein of Mortal Kombat.

It was one of the last ever games to be released on the Neo Geo. The original Japanese version of the game also has a great deal of dialogue in single-player mode, but all of those scenes are simply left out when the game's language is set to English. The domestic Xbox version of that release restores these scenes and translates them into English. The game was also ported to the PlayStation 2, which was released in Japan and Europe.<br/><br/>Following the revitalization of SNK after its collapse in 2001, the company decided that it would be worthwhile to create another game in the largely-defunct Samurai Shodown series. As part of their reorganization, development duties were given over to the relatively-unknown Yuki Enterprise, which had mainly only created simulation and board games for the Simple 2000 series of PlayStation 2 games in Japan, and had no experience in developing fighting games.<br/><br/>In spite of this, SNK managed to raise excitement by announcing that Nobuhiro Watsuki, the creator and author of the Rurouni Kenshin manga and anime series, was hired to design some of the new characters, and they were gradually revealed by way of silhouettes on the official website, and slowly showing the official artwork. Word finally got out that the game was to be a true prequel to the rest of the series, taking place two years before the first Samurai Shodown game. This created its own issues with the series timeline.<br/><br/>The gameplay was sped up slightly from Samurai Shodown IV, and the button layout was changed again.<br/><br/>The Slash/Bust system of the last few games was done away with, and each character now only had one version, though in several cases, the Bust mode was replaced by a new character of very similar setup.<br/><br/>The most significant addition to the fighting system, is the &quot;defense&quot; button. This button&mdash;depending on the position of the joystick&mdash;allows the player to duck, quickly jump back, quickly jump forward or roll. This gives more tactical possibilities and balances the player with more evasive moves, rather than loading the buttons with attacks. Clearly, Yuki's strategy game experience was shown in the new fighting system. Brought back from the original two SS games, is the combination of the A and B buttons to create a fierce slash attack rather than having its own button, like the last two SS games. The C button is once again a kick.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Samurai Shodown V , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79937": {"poll": [], "name": "Samurai Shodown V Special", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade Edition", "US Neo Geo AES edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562302.png", "videogameseries": ["Samurai Shodown"], "videogametheme": ["Alternate Historical", "Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Yuki Enterprise"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Neo Geo"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1562302_t.png", "description": "Samurai Shodown V Special is the ninth game in SNK's Samurai Shodown/Samurai Spirits series of fighting games. This game is an upgraded version of the game titled Samurai Shodown V, and is the last official game for the Neo Geo platform. A further upgraded version of the game, Samurai Shodown V Special Final Edition, was location tested, but never officially released.<br/><br/>The core gameplay remained relatively the same from Samurai Shodown V, but there were all new graphics, including portraits done by artist Satoshi Ito, which conveys a dark atmosphere similar to that of Samurai Shodown III<br/><br/>A significant amount of changes were made between Samurai Shodown V and Samurai Shodown V Special. Among them, the midboss characters Sankuro and Yumeji were taken out and replaced with SS1 boss Amakusa Shiro Tokisada and SS3 boss Zankuro Minazuki. While hidden character Poppy was replaced with SS2 boss Rashoujin Mizuki, playable without needing a hidden code.<br/><br/>In addition to the roster change, many graphical and sound changes were done to give the game a fresh feel, even though most of the returning characters used their old voices dating all the way back to Samurai Shodown IV. Existing SS5 character stages were modified in one way or another, and new stages were presented for the arrival of Amakusa, Zankuro, and Mizuki. Mizuki's stage was all new.<br/><br/>This game also has many gameplay tweaks, making this version much more balanced than its predecessor. The biggest gameplay change, however, was the introduction of the Zetsumei Ougi, or the Overkill move for English-speaking areas. If this move was performed properly, it would instantly end the match for its victim, regardless of how much life he or she had remaining, a concept similar to that of the Guilty Gear series, except the conditions to execute the move were more strict, as your character had to be in a rage explosion while the opponent's life is below the point they could or could've entered Concentration One, which was introduced in Samurai Shodown V as a special slow motion mode they could power up by meditating. (Holding D while standing still) The start up motion is the same for each character when you attempt it, but if it were to hit, the attacking character would finish off their victim in their own unique fashion.<br/><br/>In addition to the overkill moves, generic fatality effects from Samurai Shodown IV were brought back for this game, such as being slashed in half in a horizontal fashion. New fatality effects were also introduced, such as being split in half vertically with the splitting victim drenching their opponent with their blood as in Samurai Shodown IV. In addition, Nakoruru and Rimururu, who both were made &quot;immune&quot; to fatality effects in SS3 and 4, were able to experience these fatality effects at the end of a match as well, and in some situations lead to them screaming violently.<br/><br/>This combination of violent acts represented in Samurai Shodown V Special generated a lot of controversy.

It was SNK's first attempt to bring one of their franchises into the 3D realm. After having released four Samurai Shodown games on the Neo-Geo, SNK announced that they would be producing a new arcade hardware platform, this one 64-bit and with extensive 3D capabilities. Although it was never ported to home consoles, it was followed by a second 3D installment titled Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage.<br/><br/>The gameplay takes full advantage of its 3D engine, with the ability to move in any direction (in a fashion that was later modified and used in Namco's Soul series). It is also the first 3D fighting game to use multi-tiered stages (although Midway's Mortal Kombat 3, a 2D fighter, utilized this concept two years earlier), where it was possible to knock an opponent through a wall or floor into a different section of the same arena. This idea was later used in Tecmo's Dead or Alive series, which is frequently (and erroneously) credited for the innovation. It also makes use of the then-traditional setup of being able to knock an opponent out of the fighting area entirely, thus resulting in a victory by &quot;ring out.&quot;<br/><br/>Each character also has a &quot;stamina bar&quot; which decreases with excessive movement and attacks, and it replenishes while inactive. There is also a &quot;POW meter&quot;, which, once it reaches maximum, allows the player the ability to obtain unlimited stamina for a period of time, and the ability to execute a super move, with devastating results.<br/><br/>Compared to previous games in the series, the overall pace is slower and more methodical. The control scheme also took some growing accustomed to, as special moves tended to have only one version, rather than multiple strengths based on the buttons pressed. The hardware itself was also something of an underperformer, and the visuals were lacking in fine detail, with the textures looking particularly low-resolution and characters looking blocky with clearly visible polygonal edges. The game also introduced two new playable characters:<br/><br/><br/>     Yagyu Hanma, a muscular man with a metallic, gigantic arm<br/>     Shiki, a swordswoman proficient in fighting with dual katana, who is later chosen as one of SNK's selectable representatives in the fighting game, SVC Chaos: SNK vs. Capcom and Neo Geo Battle Coliseum.<br/><br/><br/>All in all, the game was not received as well as SNK had hoped, so they sought to remedy the game's problems in the sequel, Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Samurai Shodown 64 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79943": {"poll": [], "name": "Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1575537.png", "videogameseries": ["Samurai Shodown"], "videogametheme": ["Alternate Historical", "Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1575537_t.png", "description": "Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage, known as Samurai Spirits 2: Tale of the Murderous Demon Asura (SAMURAI SPIRITS 2 \uff5e\u30a2\u30b9\u30e9\u65ac\u9b54\u4f1d\uff5e Samurai Supirittsu Ts\u016b: Asura Zanmaden) in Japan, is a 3D fighting game produced by SNK for its Hyper Neogeo 64 system. It is the followup to the original Samurai Shodown 64 on the same platform, and like its predecessor, it received relatively no distribution outside of Japan.<br/><br/>After the lukewarm critical and fan reception of the previous Samurai Shodown game, SNK listened to customer comments and complaints, and set about trying to restore more of a two-dimensional feel to the gameplay, in order to draw fans who enjoyed the earlier iterations of the series.<br/><br/>The most obvious difference is the lack of full 3D movement, which was replaced by a more standard dodge into the foreground or background. Controls were more standardized, with multiple strengths of special moves, and the near-total removal of short chain combos. Also, when a character's &quot;rage gauge&quot; was fully charged, it was possible to power up certain moves, in a fashion similar to that of ES Specials in DarkStalkers. To help promote aggressive play, a &quot;stumbling&quot; system was introduced, wherein a character would stumble and fall backwards if trying to hop backwards twice in a row. The system continued the use of the Slash/Bust system, in which there were two alternate versions of each character, with different movesets. This game also further differentiated the two by making the two versions also look dramatically different from one another, in most cases. Only two new characters are introduced to the series in this installment:<br/><br/><br/>     Asura, a revived warrior with the power to summon seven weapons, who wants to destroy his old opponent, Yuga.<br/>     Taizan Morozumi, a warrior who wants to avenge the death of his wife and son, both killed by Yuga.<br/><br/><br/>In spite of all the positive changes, the game still met with average reviews, not helped by the platform's meager graphical capabilities when compared to other contemporary arcade hardware, such as the Sega Model 3.<br/><br/>The game experienced a minor revival in the form of a scaled-down 2D &quot;port&quot; for the Neo-Geo Pocket Color, entitled Samurai Shodown! 2. It included the entire cast except for Hanma Yagyu, and re-added Charlotte and Jubei.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79944": {"poll": [], "name": "Samurai Shodown: Warriors Rage", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Playstation Edition"], "average": "8", "videogameseries": ["Samurai Shodown"], "videogametheme": ["Alternate Historical", "Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "description": "Samurai Shodown: Warriors Rage, known as New Chapter of Samurai Spirits, Strange Tale of the Swordsman: Revival of the Blue and Red Blade (\uff5e\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4\u65b0\u7ae0\uff5e\u5263\u5ba2\u7570\u805e\u9332 \u7526\u308a\u3057\u84bc\u7d05\u306e\u5203 ~Samurai Supirittsu Shinsh\u014d~ Kenkaku Ibunroku: Yomigaerishi S\u014dk\u014d no Yaiba) in Japan, is the seventh game in SNK's Samurai Shodown series of fighting games.<br/><br/>Continuing onward from the storyline set forth in the two Hyper Neo Geo 64 games in the series, Samurai Shodown: Warriors Rage takes place 20 years later, with a dramatically revamped cast, and was released solely for the Sony PlayStation. Though other SS games have followed it, it is chronologically the last game in the series, and is the only game in the series proper to not get an arcade release.<br/><br/>The first and most audacious change is the revamped character roster, which removed every playable character from previous games, with the exception of Haohmaru, who was now a middle-aged man, sporting a beard and missing his trademark mop of black hair. Hanzo Hattori also appeared, though it was not actually the same man, but rather the original Hanzo's son, Shinzo, who had assumed his name. Nicotine Caffeine, Nakoruru and Rimururu also played a role in the story, but were not in a playable form. Every other character was a new design.<br/><br/>The game was also very plot-intensive, with more than two dozen characters, each one having a reasonably significant role to play in the story.<br/><br/>Though the game was still in 3D, SNK sought to further diminish the role of the third dimension, making all gameplay on a straight line, with no movement along the Z-axis, beyond a basic dodge. Two buttons controlled weak and strong slashes, a third controlled kick attacks, and the fourth was used for dodges.<br/><br/>The game introduced a new lifebar system, which was subdivided into three sections. The first &quot;round&quot; of the fight lasted until one person was drained of all three sections, upon which one section of the bar would disappear, and the remaining two would refill. Once those two were drained, the second section would be dropped, with the last one refilled. This was punctuated by a pause in the action, during which the other player would go through a taunt animation. The match was finally over when one player had been drained of this last section of life.<br/><br/>Aside from the lifebar system, gameplay was relatively straightforward.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Samurai Shodown: Warriors Rage , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79945": {"poll": [], "name": "Samurai Shodown: Sen", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Arcade Edition", "US Xbox 360 edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Samurai Shodown"], "videogametheme": ["Alternate Historical", "Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["K2 Co., Ltd.", "SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Xbox 360"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation", "Xseed Games"], "description": "Samurai Shodown: Sen, known as Samurai Spirits: Flash (\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4\u9583 Samurai Supirittsu Sen) in Japan, is the fourth 3D game in SNK's popular Samurai Shodown series of fighting games and the eleventh overall title in the series.

It was never released outside of Japan.<br/><br/>As the original title does not translate smoothly to English, it is commonly simply referred to as Samurai Shodown RPG. Alternatively, it has also been referred to as Samurai Spirits: True Legends of Furious Bushido RPG.<br/><br/>The basic setup of the game is very similar to most console RPGs, such as Final Fantasy. Your characters roam an overworld, enter towns and dungeons, and get into battles, which occur on a separate screen. The menu options enable equipping of armor and accessories, as well as use of items.<br/><br/>At the outset, the player is given the option to choose from six characters to be the &quot;main&quot; character of the story. They were Haohmaru, Nakoruru, Genjuro Kibagami, Galford D. Weller, Ukyo Tachibana and Cham Cham. The basic outline of the plot did not diverge greatly for any of them, but each had different dialogue ingame, and each also had unique special scenes which would go into greater detail of the character. In addition, to better adjust to character continuity, certain stories were modified slightly based on the selected chapter. Over the course of the game, two other characters could also join your party (unless the hero is Genjuro who only gains a partner in his second story). The secondary characters who could join you were Charlotte Christine Colde, Rimururu and Kyoshiro Senryo, as well as other &quot;main&quot; characters whom the player did not select at the outset. In addition, the second chapter also introduced a new character, a warrior by the name of Shippuu no Reon (\u75be\u98a8\u306e\u9234\u97f3), whose name translates roughly to &quot;The Ringing of the Gale Winds.&quot; All of the first two Samurai Shodown games' characters make an appearance, either as a temporary helper, plot device, and/or enemy.<br/><br/>From a game-mechanics standpoint, combat is not unlike Final Fantasy in most respects. Its most significant deviation from formula is that there is an option which enables the player to input the joystick motions for the various special moves manually, just as they were done in the arcade games, rather than simply selecting the moves from a list. For example, to do Haohmaru's Senpuu Retsuzan, or &quot;Cyclone Slash&quot; (Japanese: \u65cb\u98a8\u70c8\u65ac), one could do the standard &quot;quarter-circle forward&quot; motion of pressing down, down-right, and then right plus the attack button in sequence. This, combined with the overall speed of combat, makes for fairly engaging gameplay, as it requires one to remember the motions for a character's moves.<br/><br/>Tactically, the game ranged wildly (but steadily) in its overall difficulty. The second chapter is notably more difficult than the first, and the standard &quot;attack&quot; command is rarely useful, in comparison to the ubiquitous special moves. The characters are given an ample supply of &quot;spirit points&quot; with which to do these moves, and they are always needed, as they are typically the only things that are effective against most foes of equal or greater strength.<br/><br/>While armor and accessories could be bought and equipped, there are no weapons for sale anywhere. Each character has the same weapon throughout the game, and players could visit blacksmiths in the game to temper their weapons to make them stronger. These smiths could also infuse the weapons with one of the game's various elements, which would make the weapon's normal strikes and select special moves more effective against certain enemies, depending on which was chosen.<br/><br/>The various dungeons and overworld maps tended to be small in size, which compensated for the extremely high encounter rate. On average, in a dungeon/overworld, fights would begin every 3&ndash;5 seconds of movement (slightly more frequent while running). By playing through both chapters with a single character (not including load times), total game length was roughly 20&ndash;25 hours.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Samurai_showdown_rpg, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79948": {"poll": [], "name": "Battle of Britain", "videogamemode": ["Asynchronous Multiplayer", "Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Win 95/98 version"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic793910.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Flight", "Historical", "Military", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "7", "videogamedeveloper": ["TalonSoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "7.71429", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["TalonSoft"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic793910_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box<br/><br/>The German war machine has just conquered all of France.

First, there's a house of straw, then one of wood, and then one of brick.  They're all victims of the wolf's incredibly bad breath.

The game assumes that the player took up the Reticulans offer of resettling the most able of humanity in a space station, while allowing the rest to die, consumed by the Biomass that the Reticulans could not control (However, in the first game the player could reject their offer, and save the Earth while defending against both the Reticulans and the Biomass). Having lost contact with the Earth, the player must find out what happened.<br/><br/>The combat section is a real-time system with adjustable and pausable speed, and it has been improved to feature such things as multi-level battlefields and enterable buildings, at the cost of losing some features like destructible terrain. The strategic section holds resource and squad management, research, development, some limited diplomacy and planning of attacks. As a departure from the X-COMs and the prequel, there is no air-to-air interception.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, UFO: Aftershock , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79959": {"rpgdesigner": ["Brant Guillory"], "rpgitemversion": ["Folio Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Esaene", "rpgartist": ["Brant Guillory"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic787287.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": ["Review"], "rpg": ["Esaene"], "rpgpublisher": ["BaDGe Publications"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic787287_t.jpg", "description": "from the back of the folio:<br/><br/>A role-playing game of high fantasy.<br/><br/>BaDGe Publications' new role-playing game Esaene is a great leap forward for role-players everywhere.

Thick intertwining columns of smoke have been spotted rising from the Plains, always an excellent indicator of a predatory warband on the move. A small family clan of Centaurs was found slaughtered on the northern road to Kaad by a merchant convoy from that town.

Then, Lael Whitebeard, a hermit and hedge-wizard who lived in a small stone hut about a day&rsquo;s ride into the Plains, was found wandering towards Bitterford by a Guard rider out scouting. Most of his skin had been flayed and removed, apparently by a particularly blunt sword.

The iPhone has Wi-Fi and can connect to many cellular networks, including 1xRTT (represented by a 1x on the status bar) and GPRS (shown as GPRS on the status bar), EDGE (shown as a capital E on the status bar), UMTS and EV-DO (shown as 3G), a faster version of UMTS and 4G (shown as a 4G symbol on the status bar), and LTE (shown as LTE on the status bar). An iPhone can shoot video (though this was not a standard feature until the iPhone 3GS), take photos, play music, send and receive email, browse the web, send texts, GPS navigation, record notes, do mathematical calculations, and receive visual voicemail. Other functions&mdash;video games, reference works, social networking, etc.&mdash;can be enabled by downloading application programs (&lsquo;apps&rsquo;); as of October 2013, the App Store offered more than one million apps by Apple and third parties and is ranked as the world's second largest mobile software distribution network of its kind (by number of currently available applications).<br/><br/>There are eight generations of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the eight major releases of iOS. The original 1st-generation iPhone was a GSM phone and established design precedents, such as a button placement that has persisted throughout all releases and a screen size maintained for the next four iterations. The iPhone 3G added 3G cellular network capabilities and A-GPS location. The iPhone 3GS added a faster processor and a higher-resolution camera that could record video at 480p. The iPhone 4 featured a higher-resolution 960&times;640 &quot;Retina Display&quot;, a VGA front-facing camera for video calling and other apps, and a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera with 720p video capture. The iPhone 4S upgrades to an 8-megapixel camera with 1080p video recording, a dual-core A5 processor, and a natural language voice control system called Siri. iPhone 5 features the dual-core A6 processor, increases the size of the Retina display to 4 inches, introduces LTE support and replaces the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The iPhone 5S features the dual-core 64-bit A7 processor, an updated camera with a larger aperture and dual-LED flash, and the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, integrated into the home button. The iPhone 5C features the same A6 chip as the iPhone 5, along with a new backside-illuminated FaceTime camera and a new casing made of polycarbonate.

It was originally released in 1996 for the MVS arcade platform. The game is widely known for its sense of humor, fluid hand-drawn animation, and fast paced two-player action. It is the first title in the Metal Slug series.<br/><br/>The player has to constantly shoot at a continual stream of enemies in order to reach the end of a level. At the end of each level, the player might confront a boss who is often considerably larger than regular enemies and takes many shots to defeat. On the way through the level, the player finds weapons upgrades and &quot;Metal Slug&quot; tanks that can be used not only as weapons but also as added defense.<br/><br/>The protagonists can perform melee attacks by using a knife and/or kicking. The player does not die for simply coming into contact with most enemies. Correspondingly, many of the enemy troops have melee attacks. Much of the game's scenery is destructible. Sometimes this reveals extra items or powerups, most of the time it simply results in collateral damage.<br/><br/>During the course of a level, the player encounters prisoners of war. If they are freed, the player can receive bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. The player receives a score bonus for freeing POWs at the end of the level; at this point the game shows the name and rank for each of the prisoners freed. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs is restarted.<br/><br/>There are a total of six levels, with themes ranging from forests, garrisoned cities, snowy mountain valleys, canyons, and military bases.<br/><br/>The vast majority of enemies encountered in Metal Slug are enemy soldiers, who are given weaponry that fits their specific role. There also a host of mechanized enemies: tanks, mobile artillery, aircraft, armored personnel carriers and technicals. Much of the game's humor comes from how the enemies portray themselves. The player encounters them at many times of leisure: sunbathing, roasting food over a fire, or just conversing amongst themselves. They will also scream loudly if they see the player, while doing these things.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Metal Slug , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79533": {"videogame": ["Metal Slug Anthology"], "poll": [], "name": "Metal Slug 2", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade edition", "Japanese Neo Geo edition", "North American PlayStation edition", "PSN PSOne Classics Downloadable edition", "Wii Virtual Console (Neo Geo) edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic801032.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Metal Slug"], "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "33", "videogamedeveloper": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Run-and-gun"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "Neo Geo", "PlayStation", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation Vita", "PSP", "Wii"], "average": "7.54545", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SNK Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["Metal Slug Anthology"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic801032_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Metal Slug 2 (\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30b9\u30e9\u30c3\u30b0 2) is a run and gun video game for the Neo-Geo console/arcade platform created by SNK. It was released in 1998 for the MVS arcade platform and is the sequel to the popular Metal Slug. It is the second title in the Metal Slug series. The game was later re-released in a slightly modified/remixed form as Metal Slug X. It was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on December 1, 2008 at a cost of 900 Wii Points.<br/><br/>General Morden, the antagonist from the first game is back once more with his army, bent on taking over the world. It is up to the Peregrine Falcon squad, who are now joined by two new characters: Eri Kasamoto and Fiolina Germi of the Sparrows Intelligence Unit, to save the day.<br/><br/>As the levels unfold, it turns out that Morden has allied with Martians to help facilitate his plans. In the final level of the game, the tables are turned when Morden comes under attack and is betrayed by his Martian allies and taken prisoner by them. An ad-hoc alliance is formed between the Peregrine Falcon squad and General Morden's army to combat the greater alien threat. After a long battle, they succeed in defeating the Martians' Mothership, driving them off the Earth. Morden seems to have fallen from the ship, strapped to a solid iron plate. While his soldiers celebrate, the plate loses its balance and crushes him.<br/><br/>A revised version of Metal Slug 2, titled Metal Slug X, was released on March 1999 for the Neo Geo MVS. It fixed problems with slowdown present in Metal Slug 2, and increased the difficulty. Metal Slug X also introduced a few new elements to the Metal Slug 2 game system. New weapons and items were added, such as the &quot;Iron Lizard&quot; and the &quot;Drop Shot&quot;.

It was released in 2006. There was a PS2 port in September 14, 2006. It is also featured in Metal Slug Anthology for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable.<br/><br/>Metal Slug 6 returns to the Rebel-Martian alliance featured in Metal Slugs 2, X, and 3, but on a much broader scale. Rather than repeating the previous games' events of the Martians breaking the alliance and the Rebels assisting the player in turn, the player now teams up with the Rebels and Martians to combat an even greater threat.<br/><br/>There are now two modes of play the player can choose from right at the beginning: Easy and Hard. Easy mode lowers the difficulty of the game and changes the player's default weapon to the Heavy Machine Gun; however, the game ends just before the fifth and final mission.<br/><br/>As with previous installments, Metal Slug 6 adds a number of new Slugs as well as a new weapon, the Zantetsu Sword, which allows the player's melee weapon to emit lethal energy waves that can neutralize enemy firepower.<br/><br/>New techniques are now present, activated through certain button combinations. Characters can now throw away one gun power-up's worth of ammunition, to give to the other player or simply discard altogether. A secondary melee attack is also available. Conversely, the sliding technique from Metal Slug 5 has been removed, and players except Fio and Ralf only receive half as much ammo for special guns.<br/><br/>Metal Slug 6 introduces a new play mechanic dubbed the 'Weapon Stock System'. Two gun power-ups can now be carried at the same time. Players can switch between the two weapons, or simply put them both away in favor of the default weapon. When obtaining a new weapon power-up, it will automatically occupy the inactive slot, or, if both are holstered, replace the less recent weapon of the two.<br/><br/>The score is now multiplied by powers of 2. The faster the speed at which enemies are killed, the higher the power, as a meter at the bottom of the screen shows. When it says &quot;Max&quot; enemies and destructible objects will drop coins for an extra high score.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Metal Slug 6&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79539": {"poll": [], "name": "Metal Slug 7", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["American DS Edition", "American PSP Edition", "Australian DS Edition", "European DS Edition", "Japanese DS Edition", "Japanese PSP Edition", "Xbox Live Edition"], "average": "5.5", "videogameseries": ["Metal Slug"], "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Playmore"], "videogamegenre": ["Run-and-gun"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS", "PSP", "Xbox 360"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atlus Co.

The most notable features include:<br/><br/>Lead Blocker Control: After selecting a running play, the player will be able to cycle through the offensive players as they get into position at the line. The player can choose the athlete to control when the ball is snapped, and the game camera will zoom in on the fullback, tackle, guard, center, tight end, or wide receiver selected. With this feature, it is now possible for the player to open up a path for a running play, as the computer controls the halfback and tries to slip through the gap created. This feature also appeals to Madden players who do not wish to use computer assistance in any way, shape, or form. This feature allows the player to manually block with their fullback, tackle, guard, center, tight end, or wide receiver and quickly switch to their halfback to manually slip through the gap created, thus eliminating any computer assistance during the gameplay.<br/><br/>Highlight Stick: Players can now move the right analog stick in any direction to see an animation where the smaller running backs will duck, spin, or squirt out of a tackle. It is also possible to string such evasive moves together, piecing together a juke left with a hop step backwards (down on the right analog for stick on Ps2 and Xbox or for gamecube down on the C stick) to elude defenders. The Truck Stick animations still exist for the bigger backs, but also feature more variety of running moves with the addition of the Highlight Stick. For example, using the Highlight Stick with Tiki Barber, a smaller back not known for trucking, utilizes an array of moves to avoid and squirt out of tackles.<br/><br/>Juking and Spinning: Players can now choose two types of both Jukes and Spins to avoid would-be tacklers. For the PS2, players can either do a cut move to the left or right using the L1 or R1 buttons respectively, or a wider juke to the left or right by flicking the Right Analog stick left or right respectively. For a quick spin to allude a tackler the player simply taps the circle button. For a stronger spin which could possibly break a tackle, simply hold down the circle button.<br/><br/>FreeMotion Controls: The Wii version of Madden NFL 07, which was developed at EA Canada rather than Tiburon, features a unique control scheme that has been completely redone to complement the motion sensing capabilities of the console's Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Madden NFL 07&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79557": {"poll": [], "name": "NCAA Football 11", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Xbox 360 edition"], "average": "7.975", "videogameseries": ["NCAA Football"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - American Football"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["EA Tiburon"], "videogamefranchise": ["EA Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2010 Game Critics Best Sports Game of the Year Nominee"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["EA Sports"], "description": "On February 26, 2010, the first features for the game were announced.<br/><br/>* Dynasty Wire, a web based story generator created for Online Dynasty play.<br/>    * New momentum based locomotion engine, creating more realistic movements.<br/>    * Team-specific entrances into the game.<br/>    * Real Assignment AI and a new blocking system.<br/>    * Helmet numbers for teams such as Alabama.<br/>    * On-field referees.<br/>    * Pro-Tak gang tackling.<br/>    * Auto-saves.<br/>    * Formation substitutions.<br/>    * Improved equipment such as helmets, towels, hand warmers, sleeves, and knee braces.<br/>    * Dynamic conference logos (for Team Builder play and Custom Conferences).<br/>    * Auto loading rosters.<br/>    * Single bowl season (for Online Dynasty play).<br/>    * New team mascots.<br/>    * Improved lighting.<br/>    * ESPN style presentation and commentary featuring Brad Nessler, Kirk Herbstreit, and Erin Andrews.

The object is to line up colored blocks into rows of similar colors to make them disappear, similar to Columns. Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, about which they were tangled in a legal dispute at the time.<br/><br/>Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen. It constantly rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, and can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and either deposit them in the playing area or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. A block which is not caught and placed in the playing area or pushed back up the belt is considered a drop. The blocks are solid colours, but there is also a flashing block which can be used as a wildcard on any colour.<br/><br/>Klax consists of 100 levels grouped into blocks of five. At the beginning of the game and after each fifth level (levels divisible by five, except for Level 95 and 100), a player can choose to skip five or ten levels. Skipping levels gives bonus points and more drops.<br/><br/>In the playing area, blocks can be eliminated by getting three or more &quot;Klaxes&quot; (groups) of the same color in a line. The line may be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. A multiple grouping (i.e., one vertical and horizontal) counts as two Klaxes. In a few early levels, the player may be able to warp ahead 45 levels if he builds a large X with five blocks for each diagonal. Doing so awards a 600,000 point bonus (plus any due warp bonus).<br/><br/>There are 100 levels in Klax, and a score of 250,000 is required to complete the last level.

Based on a 1 MHz 6502A CPU, it came in 16 KB or 48 KB RAM variants for &pound;129 and &pound;169 respectively, matching the models available for the popular ZX Spectrum and undercutting the price of the 48K Spectrum by a few pounds. Both Oric-1 versions had a 16 KB ROM containing the operating system and a modified BASIC interpreter.<br/><br/>The Oric-1 improved somewhat over the Spectrum with a different keyboard design replacing the Spectrum's renowned &quot;dead flesh&quot; one. In addition the Oric had a true sound chip, the programmable GI 8912, and two graphical modes handled by a semi-custom ASIC (ULA) which also managed the interface between the processor and memory. The two modes were a LORES text only mode (though the character set could be redefined to produce graphics) with 28 rows of 40 characters and a HIRES mode with 200 rows of 240 pixels above three lines of text. Like the Spectrum, the Oric-1 suffered from attribute clash&mdash;albeit to a lesser degree in HIRES mode, when a single row of pixels could be coloured differently from the one below in contrast to the Spectrum, which applied foreground and background color in 8 x 8 pixel blocks. As it was meant for the home market, it had a built in television RF modulator as well as RGB output and was meant to work with a basic audio tape recorder to save and load data. Error-checking of recorded programs was bugged, frequently causing user-created programs to fail when loaded back in. A nice feature was an almost standard (except for the connector) Centronics printer interface.<br/><br/>According to the Oric World website (see External links, below), about 160,000 Oric-1s were sold in the UK in 1983 with another 50,000 sold in France (where it was the top-selling machine that year). Although not the 350,000 predicted, it was enough for Oric International to be bought out by Edenspring and given &pound;4m in funding.<br/><br/>In 1983 the first communications software for both the Oric 1 and Oric Atmos were produced (Oricoms and Atcoms). This software, written by John Henry Patrick Rushton and accompanying manual (Written by Trevor F Shaw) - both of Telford, Shropshire - utilised the 6522 ACIA (Asynchronous Communications Interface Adaptor which served as a I/O port controller for the 6502 family of microprocessors). This software (the first of its type for the Oric series of computers and indeed one of the early pioneers of home computer communications) enabled the Oric 1 and Atmos to communicate with Prestel (a fore-runner of the Internet-which used Ceefax style graphics), with Bulletin Boards and facilitated the transfer of files from one Oric/Atmos to another, via the public telephone system. The transfer speeds being either 300 or 1200 baud (this could occur at both full and half duplex). John H P Rushton was later - in the spring of 1984- to produce the first (for the Oric 1 and Atmos) 'true' high resolution Computer Aided Design utilities (C.A.D.) known as Oricad and Atcad respectively.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Oric-1,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79576": {"rpgartist": ["Gary Bedell", "Joshua L.

Phantasy Star IV is also the first game in the series to have in-depth character interaction and development.<br/><br/>Phantasy Star IV takes place 1,000 years after the events of Phantasy Star II. It is the story of Chaz Ashley, a young bounty hunter, who, along with his friends and allies, unwittingly becomes the savior of the Algol solar system. The story takes place on the planet Motavia, which has suffered through dramatic climate changes over the past 1,000 years. After an event called the Great Collapse, much of the once-thriving ecosystem has been reduced to desert, and life has become difficult for the planet's inhabitants. To make matters worse, there has been a marked increase in the appearances of &quot;biomonsters&quot;, strange and violent mutations of the normal plant and animal life.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Phantasy Star IV , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79583": {"poll": [], "name": "Phantasy Star Portable", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK PSP Edition"], "average": "7.75", "videogameseries": ["Phantasy Star"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Alfa System", "Sonic Team"], "videogamegenre": ["Action RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["PSP"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "description": "[ From back of UK PSP edition box ]<br/><br/>Play Phantasy Star Universe anywhere, anytime!<br/><br/>Find out what has happened after Phantasy Star Universe in this new storyline.

The objective of the game is to manage a football club successfully within the top five divisions of the English league system. Premier Manager is the first game in the Premier Manager series.<br/><br/>Premier Manager allows up to four users to play the game as managers of English football conference league football clubs. The user must manage the team to win football matches and maintain financial stability. There is no set target to the game, but the general aim is to manage teams as successfully as possible, by managing a Premier League team to the championship title and winning the trophy competitions, such as the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.<br/><br/>To win matches, the manager must set formations, pick the team, buy new players, and adequately set coaching schedules to maintain player abilities. To be financially successful, the manager must not spend more than is available. The manager can also raise money by getting loans, selling players, organising sponsorship and ticket sales. The manager can increase revenue from ticket sales by improving the stadium capacity and facilities, and raising ticket prices accordingly.<br/><br/>Premier Manager covers the top five divisions of the English football league system that were known at the time as the Premier League, Division One, Division Two, Division Three and Conference League and also a fictitious &quot;Part Time&quot; league, made up of real non-league teams.

The team can play in both the league and cup competitions.<br/><br/>In the conference league the teams automatically qualify for the FA Cup first round, unlike in reality where non-league teams must go through qualifying rounds.<br/><br/>As well as managing the team, the user must also manage the club's finances, such as bank loans and advertising boards. Money can be raised by selling players, adding sponsors and ticket sales (as well as some miscellaneous events). To improve ticket sales the user can invest in upgrading various aspects of the stadium such as seating and facilities.<br/><br/>The game is for one or two players which can choose their team at the beginning of the game. The two users must then take turns in accessing the computer game to manage their teams. During player transfers, both users are requested to make a bid.

There is an AGA version of Premier Manager 3 as well as a standard version for all Amigas.<br/><br/>Premier Manager 3 is a football management video game that puts the player in charge of a football club. The player has to manage not only the team and tactics to win football matches, but also the club's finances such as applying for bank loans, organising advertising boards and scheduling stadium improvements. The primary interface is made up of 12 main sections. These are team settings, telephone, fax machine, sponsorship, ground improvements, business case, club finances, transfer market, history, league tables, cup competitions and play the next match. From this interface the player can access all the settings necessary to manage the football club.<br/><br/>When the game starts, the user takes control of a conference league team of their choice. If the user manages the team poorly and finishes in last position in the league, the team will not be relegated; in real life, a team finishing in the relegation zone would have gone down to what is now Level 7 in the English football league system at the time, although since 2004 two leagues were added between these leagues and the Conference National. To be successful, the user must not only win football matches, but also manage the finances of the club well. If the player is in too much debt then the player can be fired even if he had good results.<br/><br/>The user can change the club he manages by taking job offers from other clubs at the end of the season or applying for a position at a club where a manager has been fired mid season. The managerial rating of the user affects whether or not this application is successful. Premier Manager 3 can be played by two players, though they have to take turns accessing their teams. In a new feature to the series, the users can attempt to outbid each other. Previously in Premier Manager 2, the second user had the advantage of bidding after the first user.<br/><br/>In 1996, Premier Manager 3 Deluxe was released which included the updated league, team and player statistics for the 1995/96 football season.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Premier Manager 3,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79642": {"poll": [], "name": "Premier Manager 98", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European PlayStation edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic790378.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Premier Manager"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Soccer"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Gremlin Interactive (1994-1999)"], "videogamefranchise": ["Actua Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Gremlin Interactive (1994-1999)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic790378_t.jpg", "description": "Description from the back of the game box:<br/><br/>- 1997/98 English division, team and player information.<br/>- Detailed statistics on over 2,7000 players, provided by Goal magazine.<br/>- Pull match and team tactical options, formations, playing styles, marking systems.<br/>- International transfer market with full scouting network.<br/>- European super league, upon domestic success with your team.<br/>- Financial and contract negotiation options.<br/>- Highlights of every game you manage, with commentary from Barry Davies.<br/><br/>"}, "79643": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Petre Tutunea"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Brandenburg", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic789344_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Petre Tutunea"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic789344.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Before the German blitzkrieg stormed across Europe in 1939-40, a group of elite soldiers prepared the way by seizing bridges and other strategic targets ahead of the attack.

The game featured several tracks, several pre-generated color/striping layouts, and a carpainter. This carpainter generated a template of the entire car, which could then be painted and decorated with decals and race numbers.<br/><br/>Another feature was the hornball, to be enabled via the options menu. If the player enabled it, and would press the horn while racing, a black/grey ball would be launched from the front of the car. As this ball was heavy and made of a strong material, cars could suffer severe damage crashing into the ball. The ball would disappear though if the player launched a next ball.<br/><br/>Next to the unusual hornball, the game featured a flip-option for the car. Flipping the car depended on how long and how fast the button was pressed. If done properly, the player could make the car crawl through the water and get back on land, or could make the car flip around and land on its wheels. However, when on land, flipping caused damage, also if the car would land on its wheels.<br/><br/>While racing, the player could choose between around 7 or 8 camera's, including several chase and top-down views, a bumper camera, and a camera similar to the bumper camera, but with the front wheels and suspension visible. There was also an interior camera, but from the outside, players could not look inside the car.<br/><br/>The game featured a deformation-only damage model. Minor paint scratches could appear on the body, but eventually the damage model could make cars unrecognizable and undrivable. No parts would fall off however. Cars could even suffer severe damage by hitting signs, but driving into the water would have no consequences to the driving behaviour of the car.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Viper Racing , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79664": {"poll": [], "name": "Lunar Jetman", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["BBC Micro edition", "ZX Spectrum edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1216139.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Jetman"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "3", "videogamedeveloper": ["Ultimate Play the Game"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade"], "videogameplatform": ["BBC Micro", "ZX Spectrum"], "average": "7.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Ultimate Play the Game"], "videogamecompilation": ["Rare Replay"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1216139_t.jpg", "description": "Lunar Jetman is a ZX Spectrum video game developed and released by Ultimate Play The Game in 1983. The game is the second in the Jetman series, following on from his adventures in Jetpac. In the game, Jetman has to defend the Earth (and himself) from a hostile alien base. The game was written by Chris Stamper with graphics by Tim Stamper. The game was followed by a third installment, Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warpship, released for the NES in 1990.<br/><br/>Again taking on the role of Jetman, players find themselves on the surface of a small purple moon. Similarly to Jetpac, the player can move around slowly on foot, or use a jetpac to leave the ground and navigate the moon faster. Unlike Jetpac, this time Jetman's jetpac has limited fuel, and must be topped up regularly. In addition to the jetpac, the player has a moon rover for ground travel, inside of which they are (mostly) invulnerable. However, the moon rover can only negotiate perfectly smooth ground, and the player may need to use bridging kits to fill in craters on the moon's surface (these are obtained from the rover). The rover doubles up as a refuelling point for Jetman's jetpac.<br/><br/>Aside from the rover and its bridging kits, Jetman has access to three other pieces of equipment, all of which can be carried on the back of the rover. The most important of these is a bomb. This is used to destroy alien bases when they are encountered, and must be dropped onto them while Jetman is flying. Another piece of equipment is a cannon that may be mounted onto the rover (facing either direction). As the rover is otherwise unequipped with weaponry, this can be a useful way to rack up points blasting aliens while searching for the alien base. The final piece of equipment is a teleporter (or, rather, a pair of teleporters). Entering this instantaneously transports the player (and bomb) to the teleporter's twin, allowing rapid transport around the moon.<br/><br/>Gameplay itself requires Jetman to locate and destroy (with the bomb) a series of alien bases on the surface of the moon. Each new base appears with the destruction of the previous one. To accomplish this task, either by flying the bomb directly, or transporting it on the back of the rover, the player must take the bomb to the alien base and then drop it onto the base. Although, as noted above, Jetman is (almost) invulnerable inside his rover, outside it he is at the mercy of large numbers of flying aliens, although his jetpac-mounted lasers help against these.<br/><br/>Each base needs to be destroyed within a strict time limit. If this limit expires before the base is destroyed by Jetman, two missiles are launched from the base - one for the Earth, the other for Jetman's rover (hence its almost invulnerability). Fortunately, even if the base is not destroyed on time, Jetman can still save the day by intercepting, and destroying, the missile in flight. When either the base or missile is destroyed, a new base is generated and play starts over once again. After several bases have been destroyed in succession, new (and increasingly hazardous) varieties of flying aliens assault the player.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Lunar Jetman,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79665": {"videogame": ["Sega Genesis Classic Collection: Gold Edition", "Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection"], "poll": [], "name": "Alien Storm", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amiga edition", "European Amstrad CPC Cassette edition", "European Amstrad CPC Floppy Disk edition", "Japanese Megadrive edition", "Spanish Amstrad CPC edition", "US Genesis edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic988685.png", "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "14", "videogamedeveloper": ["SEGA Corporation", "Tiertex Design Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Amstrad CPC", "Commodore 64", "SEGA Genesis", "SEGA Master System"], "average": "6.21429", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Erbe Software, S.A.", "SEGA Corporation", "U.S. Gold Ltd"], "videogamecompilation": ["Mega Games 6 Vol. 2", "Sega Genesis Classic Collection: Gold Edition", "Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic988685_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A side scrolling beat em up in the style of Golden Axe except with a sci fi scenario.

Run plays use only one starter, while Pass plays involve two starters (Quarterback plus another player). <br/>The Defense is allowed to &quot;boost&quot; the Defense Run or Pass Rating of the selected card by combining that number with the Star Rating of a second card.

The difference of the two determines the yardage. For example, if the Offense is 50 and the Defense is 41, the Run gains nine yards. If the defense uses its &quot;boost&quot; on this play and the &quot;boost&quot; rating was six, then the new Defense rating is 47 the rush gains only three yards instead.<br/><br/>Pass Plays: Add the Quarterback Pass Rating and the Pass Rating of the selected player. Take that total, and compare it to the Defense Pass Rating. The difference of the two determines the yardage. For example, if the Quarterback Pass Rating is 30 and the selected Offense Player is also 30, for a total of 60, and the Defense Pass Rating is 50, the Pass gains 10 yards. If the defense uses its &quot;boost&quot; on this play, and the &quot;boost&quot; rating was five, the pass gains five yards instead.<br/><br/>Substitutions: Teams may substitute players only at halftime.

In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long.

A game was also released for the Game Boy. The object is to defeat a burglar who managed to find Dennis' town via the local railroad connection. Stages include Mr. Wilson's house, the great outdoors, a boiler room, and eventually the big boss battle with the burglar himself.<br/><br/>Before the actual playing takes place, Dennis has just discovered that he left Mr. Wilson's door unlocked, and a thief has stolen Mr. Wilson's entire coin collection. Dennis must retrieve all of the coins before Mr. Wilson finds out. The object of the game is to collect 6 large coins scattered throughout each level. The same coin-collection game is present throughout the entirety of the game (with the exception of two stages in the first park stage set, wherein Dennis must traverse the park on a wagon led by his dog). After each sixth level, there is a boss stage, followed by a new set of levels. The sets of levels are, in order, Mr. Wilson's House, Park, Boiler Room, Sewers, and finally, Woods. The end of the woods levels, and the subsequent beating of the final boss, marks the end of the game.<br/><br/>Health is represented by hearts, located at the top-right of the screen. If touched by an enemy, one heart will disappear. Each touch by an enemy removes one heart (as well as temporarily stunning Dennis). Once all of the hearts are gone, the player must restart the level (but retains all main-coins found). Restoring health is a matter of finding the pieces of candy located throughout the levels. Each piece of candy restores 100% of Dennis' health.<br/><br/>Time is an important factor in Dennis The Menace. There is a clock, located in the top-middle of the screen, that starts at 999 seconds (16.7 minutes) and counts backwards down to 0 seconds. Once the clock is at 0 seconds, there is a game-over, which completely eradicates all work done on a level. The amount of time taken during a level, even after Dennis loses a life, remains the same (if the time is at 456 seconds, and Dennis loses a life, he will restart the level with 456 seconds).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dennis the Menace (video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79685": {"poll": [], "name": "Highlander", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European ZX Spectrum edition", "European Amstrad CPC edition", "Spanish Amstrad CPC edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Movie, Book, TV show"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Ocean Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Amstrad CPC", "ZX Spectrum"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Erbe Software, S.A.", "Ocean Software"], "description": "Highlander was a video game tie-in to the Highlander franchise.

Mega Lo Mania was released in North America as Tyrants: Fight Through Time.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to conquer 28 islands divided into sectors, with three islands per Epoch and one for the final Epoch. The player must take on the role of one of four Gods: Scarlet (Red), Oberon (Yellow), Caesar (Green) or Madcap (Blue). As their God, the player must lead his or her people by instructing them to do a number of different tasks such as create buildings, design weapons, mine for elements or form an army. The ultimate aim is to defeat all the other Gods by destroying their towers and their people.<br/>Screenshot of Mega Lo Mania (Amiga)<br/><br/>There are multiple sectors on each island, and multiple islands spanning different Epochs.<br/><br/>Each sector can be either empty, or be occupied by a particular people. Although the player cannot see before they occupy a sector, each has different types of minerals and elements available to it that can put the occupier at an advantage or disadvantage.<br/><br/>Every island has a differing shape with different numbers of sectors dividing it. Islands in this game can have anywhere between two and sixteen sectors on a four by four grid. Some islands are small enough to only allow two different Gods to play against each other, whilst others are strategically designed for various gameplay scenarios, such as islands that are not connected, requiring flight in the form of jetplanes or biplanes for armies to attack each other.<br/><br/>Epochs determine the base technology level that each group of people begin with. For example, in the 1st Epoch, the starting technology level is equal to that of 9500 BC, meaning that each starting tower resembles a caveman's dwelling. In each Epoch (except the final Epoch) there are three islands and each must be conquered before proceeding to the next. The player may use research to develop along the technology tree, eventually increasing in epoch.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Mega Lo Mania , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79709": {"poll": [], "name": "NBA Live 08", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["German PlayStation 3 edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic796864.jpg", "videogameseries": ["NBA Live"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Basketball"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Electronic Arts Inc.

(EA)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic796534_t.jpg", "description": "World Cup '98 was the first official FIFA World Cup game developed by EA Sports after obtaining the rights from FIFA in 1997. Unlike the previous World Cup games, which were in 2D and showed a bird's-eye view, World Cup 98 was the first in the franchise to use a 3D engine, utilising DirectX for the PC version. Accurate national team kits (except for the goalkeepers who were issued a generic kit) were introduced complete with kit manufacturer logos and official merchandise. The game engine is based on that of FIFA: Road to World Cup 98, though it features some minor gameplay improvements to areas such as ingame strategy changing and player positioning. The playable teams in the friendly mode also included several nations that did not qualify for the finals. World Cup 98 was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color.<br/><br/>The main feature of the game is the World Cup tournament itself, where the player may use either the actual groups used in the finals, or groups composed of a random selection of the included teams. Each match takes place in a recreation of the venue it was played in the actual tournament. As in the real tournament, group games do not go to extra time or a penalty shootout but knockout matches do.<br/><br/>The game was released prior to the actual World Cup, therefore results between CPU teams are not based on results from the actual tournament. At the end of each match, a caption shows the man of the match award, and if applicable a clean sheet caption. At the end of the &quot;World Cup&quot; game mode, captions show the winner of the Golden Boot for most goals scored during the tournament and winner of the FIFA Fair Play Award, two awards which are given in the real World Cup.<br/><br/>It is also possible to play friendly matches between any of the teams that are included in the game. At the end of a drawn game the player can choose to finish the match as a draw, play extra time with the golden goal rule, or take part in a penalty shootout.<br/><br/>As in FIFA 98, national rosters can be customised to reflect the actual tournament's players by including players from a reserves pool in the &quot;customise&quot; option.<br/><br/>The &quot;World Cup Classics&quot; mode allows the player to play eight classic World Cup Final matches from Italy versus West Germany in 1982, West Germany versus Netherlands in 1974, Brazil v Italy in 1970, England versus West Germany in 1966, West Germany versus Hungary in 1954, Uruguay versus Brazil in 1950, Italy versus Hungary in 1938, and Uruguay versus Argentina in 1930. The 1982 match is unlocked by winning the &quot;World Cup&quot; mode, and by completing each unlocked game, the next one is unlocked in the order shown above. &quot;World Cup Classics&quot; mode features accurate period team kits, hairstyles, and names, and commentary for this mode only was provided by Kenneth Wolstenholme, the BBC's commentator during the 1966 and 1970 World Cups. For the 1966, 1954 and 1950 World Cup Final matches in this mode, the graphics are in black and white, as they were shown on television at the time. The 1938 and 1930 matches are shown using sepia tone graphics. In matches that took place prior to the introduction of substitutions, it is not possible to change a player during the match.<br/><br/>The UK version of the game features commentary from John Motson and Chris Waddle, with matches introduced by the voice of Des Lynam and voice-overs in the team schedules from Gary Lineker.<br/><br/>As with Electronic Arts' main FIFA Series, France 98 features several licenced songs; &quot;Tubthumping&quot; by Chumbawamba is the title song of the game, with &quot;Terminal Intensity&quot; by The Wizard of Oh, &quot;Soul Beat Runna&quot; by Boymerang, &quot;Absurd&quot; by Fluke and others, are also used in the menus.<br/><br/>The game received mostly positive reviews. PC Guide's July 1998 issue named World Cup 98 as the winner of a group test involving other PC football games around at the same time, ahead of competitors such as Actua Soccer 2, Three Lions and Sensible Soccer 98. The magazine describes the game as &quot;Simply the best football game in the world&quot;. MobyGames scores the game 3.9/5 whilst Gamespot awards the game 8.8/10.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;World Cup 98 (video game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79719": {"poll": [], "name": "WCW Superslam", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "yearpublished": "1991", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Wrestling"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855486_t.jpg", "average": "2", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Waddington's Games, Inc."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic855486.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game", "Dice", "Sports"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the description on the back of the box:<br/><br/>&quot;The Flying Knee Drop, the Sleeper or even the Scorpion Death Lock, use any of these favourite holds from genuine WCW Wrestlers to out fight you opponent in this exciting board game.<br/>Watch the tension mount as you count down with the referee and try to recover from a Pindown, Submission or Knockout!<br/><br/>Use your team partner to tag an manoeuvre your opponent.

This is the primary source of moneymaking in the game.<br/><br/>Publicity - Organise a publicity stunt but be careful - it might just kill off your band members!<br/><br/>Gifts - Buy your band some gifts to keep them sweet, otherwise they may make some rather costly ultimatums.<br/><br/>Record - Once you've got a contract, you can choose to record your album.<br/><br/>Release - Once the album's recorded, you can release it along with any singles.<br/><br/>Along the way, you'll also have to decide:<br/><br/>Whether or not to play a charity gig. Some of the charities that contact you are real and others bogus. Either way, you could end up with negative publicity if you snub a genuine charity or get duped by a bogus one.<br/><br/>Whether or not to accept a sponsorship deal.<br/><br/>To shoot a Music video and who will direct it, the location and the theme of this project. The player has the options to select from a range of choices, each with a cost value. Expensive directors and locations or less costly ones. As with the parody nature of the game director names lampoon real life directors. A selection choice of a high level (most expensive) director is named Steven Cheeseburger (Steven Spielberg). There are many others fitting with the theme of recognizable but legally distinct names.<br/><br/>Which recording contract is best for your band.<br/><br/>What to do if a little organisation in Taiwan is pirating your records. Do nothing, sue them, buy them out or send in the heavies?<br/><br/>Releasing an album or single makes them eligible for the charts. A Top 10 Singles &amp; Albums charts (depending on what you have released) gets displayed on screen every Sunday. The other bands in the Top 10 are also parodies of other rock bands.<br/><br/>Musicians<br/><br/>At the outset, the player can choose to hire up to four musicians to make up the band. The musicians are parodies of contemporary pop music stars. Their weekly wage depends on their abilities and their fame, ranging from &pound;30,000 for &quot;Bill Collins&quot; down to just &pound;50 for &quot;Sidney Sparkle&quot;.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Rock Star Ate My Hamster , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79739": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Also sprach...", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1527095_t.png", "average": "6.2", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["ASS Altenburger Spielkarten"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1527095.png", "boardgameversion": ["ASS first edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Trivia"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Each player holds six cards containing famous quotes and the people who said them.

Donkey Kong has taken refuge in his greenhouse and it is now up to him to stop the ape from stirring up any more insects that will soon destroy his flowers.<br/><br/>The game is a simplistic shooter which actually incorporates many ideas from an older game entitled Space Firebird and adapts them into a new setting, which consists of only three repeating rounds, requiring the player to defend flowers as the objective rather than have any specific long-term goal in mind. Throughout the levels are scattered various enemies: Buzzbees, beespies, queen bees (which shatter into deadly pieces when destroyed), creepy caterpillars, butterflies, beetles, moths, beebombs and vine eaters. Stanley[2], who wears suspenders similar to the previous protagonist, Mario, must destroy the insects as they attempt to steal his flowers. Donkey Kong himself hangs from two vines at the top of the screen. Continuously using bug-spray on him will force him upwards and eventually to the top of the screen to complete the level. Killing all the bugs will also cause Donkey Kong to exit the screen and the game will go to next level. Typically, the vine grasped by Donkey Kong's left hand holds the super spray can, which will drop to the ground if the ape climbs high enough that his hand knocks it loose; this spray can forces Donkey Kong upwards at a much faster rate than the standard version, but it only lasts for a certain number of shots and only appears at the start of each &quot;life&quot;.<br/><br/>"}, "79774": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bill Fawcett"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Blue Camel", "rpgartist": ["Mitch O'Connell"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785606.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover"], "rpgsetting": ["Thieves' World"], "average": "8", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["FASA"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785606_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>3 Hours to live...<br/>  It's broad daylight and somehow you've got to get hold of this stinking blue camel in order to gt the antidote from the murderous little madman...<br/>  This is just the first of a series of exciting Thieves' World adventures being introduced by FASA.

Concerts must be played in the order they are on the board, and all tickets from the first concert must be taken before the next concert can make its tickets available, and so on.<br/><br/>To move your bus toward a concert city, draw a travel card and place it face up so all can see.  If it is a move card, there will be a white bus on the card. You can move your bus the number of spaces the white bus indicates.  If there are other buses on the card, that color bus also gets to move.  If your colored bus also happens to be on the card, then you may move again.  Buses are moved in the order they are played on the card.  In a two or three player game, ignore any buses not being played.  If you happen to end your turn on the same space as another player, then jump ahead to the next space.  In some cases, the player who drew the card will also get to move another player's bus.  These are wrong turn cards.  Any special instructions will be on the cards.<br/><br/>Sometimes a card will have special instructions, such as move to any city, or swap tickets with another player.  In these cases instead of moving this turn, just do what the card says.<br/><br/>Once you begin to move in a direction, you cannot backtrack on the same road.  The only exception is in the case where a card you draw has your color bus on it as well.  These are considered two different moves.  They must be done in the correct order on the card.<br/><br/>Ending the Game:<br/>After all 8 concerts have happened, everyone adds up their points (from Rest Stop and Concert Ticket cards).

Of course, this process is very slow and it would take tons of Einstein brains to spark rational thinking in a Zombie.

Additionally, if you are a very dedicated and strong human and have the (mis)fortune to get bitten and turned into a Zombie yourself, you may be lucky and retain some of your basic knowledge regarding routine tasks/skills. So a cop may be able to still fire a pistol - though much slower and maybe not very accurately or the Zombie nurse may still be able to perform the task of giving you an injection.<br/> And naturally,  - intelligent brains are much more attractive to Zombies than &bdquo;no-brainers&ldquo;.  Thus, a special resource is made available to Zombie Masters: Beer! Too much beer makes human brains unattractive for Zombies and those people who drink a lot of beer are not eaten by Zombies.

Its main plot was written by novelist Roger Zelazny and was his last known work, as he died during the development of the game.<br/><br/>Chronomaster narrates the story of Rene Korda (voiced by Ron Perlman), a retired and formerly renowned designer of &quot;pocket universes&quot; &mdash; self-contained worlds developed according to the tastes of the person who finances their construction. Korda is hired by a representative of the &quot;Terran Regional government&quot; to restore two pocket universes from a state of &quot;temporal stasis&quot; and to find out who is responsible for the situation.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, each pocket universe contains a single solar system with anywhere from one to several worlds Korda can visit. Each world requires Korda to travel to magnetic North and use a &quot;resonance tracer&quot; to locate the universe's &quot;world key&quot;. The world key (each protected by a unique puzzle) stops or starts the universe's temporal flow. Each pocket universe has a unique feel to it, reflecting the personality and interests of its owner. Verdry for example, owned by a woman known for creating a philosophical movement centered around nonsense and unreality, contains a world shaped and colored like an Easter egg. The laws of physics are bent and broken, and the puzzles tend to be either nonsensical, or possess a very twisted and backwards form of logic.<br/><br/>In order to move within pocket universes in which time is stagnant, Korda employs &quot;bottled time&quot;, a container which when opened provides him with a field in which times flows normally. Bottled time may also be used to activate objects and trigger ongoing events which were halted by the temporal stasis. He also counts on the help of a versatile context-sensitive tool which makes available different functions to him, depending on the pocket universe he visits. During his journey Korda is accompanied by his personal digital assistant (PDA) Jester (voiced by Lolita Davidovich), a flying blue spherical robot who provides more comic relief than help with gameplay. Korda is eventually joined by Milo, (voiced by Brent Spiner) a former student of Korda's and the sole survivor of a horrific pirate attack on his homeworld.<br/><br/>Chronomaster makes heavy use of CG cutscenes. Chronomaster possesses a degree of non-linearity in that many tasks exist which are unnecessary to complete the game, and puzzles frequently have two possible solutions.<br/><br/>Running Chronomaster on today's operating systems and machines requires the use of a DOS emulator such as Dosbox.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Chronomaster,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79803": {"poll": [], "name": "Red Steel 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian Wii edition", "English/European Wii edition", "Japanese Wii edition", "Korean Wii edition", "North American Wii edition", "Scandinavian Wii edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic955336.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Red Steel"], "videogametheme": ["Western", "Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "14", "videogamedeveloper": ["Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.

Capturables, special AI ships, and ancient alien artifacts litter the cosmos, making your choices as a player more varied than ever. Do you risk total war with the AI by capturing and rebuilding a massive golem? Do you procure defensive superweapons from Zenith traders?<br/><br/>Maybe you'd like to finally be able to build the powerful Core ships that the AI has long used -- or the all-new experimental ships with strange and powerful abilities. Befriend the dangerous alien Dyson Sphere by helping it against the AI forces, or sneak around it to avoid incurring its wrath (that thing is moody). If you see a Devourer Golem, don't forget to run -- preferably as it pummels your enemies. Any path you take, there are consequences; AI War is known for being heavily strategic even amongst strategy games, and The Zenith Remnant takes it to new heights.<br/><br/>Want to read about all the features in extreme detail?

Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.

Each player leads a nation of peoples over a mapboard much larger than in advanced civilization that stretches from the Mediterranean to India as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture. Although battles and territorial strategy are important, Civilization: The Expansion Project is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, political and religious factors. Conflicts that do arise result from rivalries and shortages of land rather than from attempts to eliminate other players. Nomads, farmers, warriors, merchants, artisans, priests and citizens all have an essential part to play in the development of each nation's civilization.

It is the first game in the Hebereke series  with almost every &quot;sequel&quot; being a completely different style of game. Hebereke is the name of the Japanese version's titular character, which is colloquial and roughly translates to 'drunk' or 'untrustworthy'. The game was later rereleased in a two-in-one Sony PlayStation game, Memorial Series Sunsoft Vol.5, which also included Raf World (known outside of Japan as Journey to Silius). In 2010, Ufouria: The Saga was rated by the Australian OFLC, implying a future rerelease. It has been confirmed that this game will be released on the Wii Virtual Console in the PAL region on July 2, 2010 and as an import in North America, to be released in the summer of 2010.<br/><br/>The games design is in the style of Metroid and Blaster Master where the player traverses an uninterrupted game world collecting items and power-ups enabling the player to reach even more locations, fighting bosses and minibosses.

All three games were developed by Triumph Studios, a Dutch game developer.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The game features a world on three different levels, the Surface, the Underground and the Shadow World. Scenarios may take place on one or more of these levels. The game can either be played in a simultaneous mode, wherein players move their units at the same time during a turn, and in a traditional turnbased mode. Note that both modes are still turnbased. The game is played both in an overworld mode, on which parties are moved and raised, structures are built and heroes are contracted, as well as a battle mode.<br/><br/>Wizards<br/><br/>The key element of the game are the Wizards. Wizards are very powerful at magic, but rather weak at close combat. Every player has one Wizard, each with a sphere of magic (Life, Death, Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Cosmos and finally Chaos/Secret), which decides which spells the Wizard can research. Some Wizards have multiple spheres, but can only learn less advanced spells. Spells range from passive spells (for instance, blessing a unit with additional strengths), to direct spells (i.e. healing spells or attack spells), to summoning spells. Wizards are the only units in the game who can't level up or gain medals. Instead, they improve by researching new spells and skills.<br/><br/>Wizards have a domain, which is the area in which the Wizard can cast his spells. When a wizard is inside a wizard's tower, the radius of his domain is increased by several hexagons, and in addition a small domain is radiated around each hero, so it is usually best to keep wizards inside a tower at all times. Every village, town and city can build a Wizard Tower, and the Wizard only has to be inside one Wizard Tower, the other towers will also increase his domain.<br/><br/>Heroes<br/><br/>Wizards can also attract heroes. Heroes are the men and women who (preferably) lead your troops into battle. Heroes, unlike Wizards, can level up. When they level up, the player can choose between three abilities for the hero to make them stronger. For example they can fire at range or improve the party morale. At a low level, they are rather vulnerable to other units, especially high tier units, so it is suggested to keep them a bit out of harm's way, for at a high level, they can become strong assets to a party, and can even destroy parties on their own. Their maximum level is 30.<br/><br/>When a Hero dies, you can only bring it back by using the reanimate or resurrect spell. When using the reanimate spell, the Hero will return to your Wizard's Seat as an Undead hero.<br/><br/>Heroes can join you either by applying at one of your cities or parties, by being recruited at an Inn or similar building, or can be attained through the use of the &quot;call hero&quot; spell.<br/><br/>Regular Units<br/><br/>Regular units represent the majority of the units in the game. These units can be divided in four levels, based on the various buildings that are needed for creating them. Units can also be awarded medals, which are given independent of respective levels. The medals represent experience and give bonuses to unit statistics.<br/><br/>Multiplayer<br/><br/>Like both its predecessors the game was designed for singleplayer as well as multiplayer, and while the graphic engine is the same as in Age of Wonders 2: The Wizard's Throne, gameplay is improved and some important features are added. While every existing race in the game received at least one new recruitable unit and new buildings, 3 races are completely new. Much needed from the fans (and referred to in the forums as the &quot;random map cult&quot;), the game now offers a &quot;Create Random Scenario&quot; option.<br/><br/>Settlements and other structures<br/><br/>There are many kinds of structures on the World Map. The most important ones are the cities and the structures that generate either gold or mana.<br/><br/>Cities come in four levels. The lowest level is the Outpost, which can only construct a Wooden Wall and the race's basic unit. The next stage, the Village, can build much more buildings. The other stages are Town and City. The stages differ in how fast they can build, and the income they generate.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Wonders' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Wonders</a>:_Shadow_Magic,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "79852": {"poll": [], "name": "Train Conductor 2: U.S.A.", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone/iPad Universal edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic867042.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Train Conductor"], "videogametheme": ["Commercial / Public Transport", "Puzzle"], "usersrated": "5", "videogamedeveloper": ["The Voxel Agents"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["iPad", "iPhone"], "average": "7.7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["The Voxel Agents"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic867042_t.jpg", "description": "Part 2 of Train Conductor.

It was designed by Guy Miller and Simon Phipps and is loosely based on the Shadowman comic book series published by Valiant Comics. The game was released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Dreamcast, and PC. A sequel, entitled Shadow Man: 2econd Coming, was released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 in 2002.<br/><br/>Shadow Man revolves around an African American man by the name of Michael LeRoi, a former English literature student made into the Shadow Man, a voodoo warrior. Ten years prior to the game's events, Mike flunked his classes and his gambling habits exhausted his funds, forcing him to take up work as a taxi cab driver in Chicago, all the while keeping his failure a secret from his family back home in New Orleans. During a routine drop-off one night, his passenger was killed in a drive-by shooting, leaving a briefcase containing $20,000 behind. Mike took the money back home to spend on his family, using it to pay for his younger brother Luke's operation, among other things. However, the gang tracked him down and began issuing threats against him and his family. In desperation, Mike sought out a bokor to give him protection against the gang's attacks. This protection worked, but only for him; Mike's entire family was killed in a drive-by, leaving only Mike alive, albeit barely.<br/><br/>Upon recovering from a coma and near-fatal injuries, Mike discovered he had lost his memory. The bokor tracked him down and collected the price for Mike's protection: Mike became his zombie slave, working under the pseudonym 'Zero'. Eventually, Mama Nettie, a powerful but dying voodoo priestess, arrived with several thugs to take revenge on the bokor for hits he had ordered against several of her gang members. In the ensuing chaos, Mama Nettie dragged Mike into a back room and used her remaining powers to forcibly implant the Mask of Shadows, a powerful voodoo artifact, into his chest. In doing so, Mike became the Shadow Man, the next in a long line of African voodoo warriors blessed by the gods with supernatural powers to protect both their native tribes and the entire world from threats crossing over from the spiritual plane known as Deadside the place where everyone goes, without exception, when they die. In addition to his newfound powers, Mike regained his memory, which began to torment him endlessly. Unable to simply end his suffering due to his newfound immortality, Mike had little choice but to enter into Mama Nettie's service.
