The Chaos Lord&rsquo;s role is to describe scenarios, ask the players what their characters want to do and then resolve these situations according to the rules of the game.<br/><br/>Other duties of the CL include setting up each scene, moving the story along, and take on the roles of all the monsters, demons and non-player characters that the player&rsquo;s avatars encounter during each adventure. It is important that the CL read through all sections of this book so that she may have an idea of where to find things once the horrors begin.<br/><br/>NOTE: The Chaos Lord has the final say in all matters!<br/><br/>AVATARS<br/><br/>All players, other than the CL will take on the role of an avatar &ndash; a character you, the other players, and the CL help to create. You create your avatar with the help of the game rules, according to your own vision for the type of character you want to play and according to the adventure presented by the CL.<br/><br/>During game play your character will likely participate in several adventures or quests and as a result will gain experience points for each skill he or she may use which will help him or her to become more skilled. <br/><br/>SKILLS<br/><br/>Each action during game play requires the use of one skill or another, sometimes more than one skill at once. To determine the success or failure of a skill, the player may be required to roll one or more dice, which is determined by the character&rsquo;s rank in that skill and is rolled against a difficulty rating. Each skill has a predefined difficulty rating, which the player must roll against to successfully use the skill.<br/><br/>For example, Nazron &ndash; a genetically enhanced Street Samurai, has Bladed Weapons +3 and a Short Sword with a difficulty rating of 5. This means that during combat, Nazron will be able to roll 3d6 when using a bladed weapon and his short sword requires that he roll at a 5. He rolls 3d6 and gets a 2, 5 and 1, since one of the die is equal to or higher than 5 he can, therefore, use the weapon successfully to slice and dice his opponents. <br/><br/>MAGIC<br/><br/>Magic is used the same as skills, each spell is ranked according to the skill level of the character and has a difficulty rating, which the player must roll against to determine the success or failure of the spell. Some spells are instantaneous, while other spells require complex rituals that may take several combat turns to cast. There are area effects spells, targeted spells and buff spells as well as magical items, such as weapons and armor. <br/><br/>DICE<br/><br/>When performing an action you may have to make a dice roll to determine the level of success or failure of said action. Throughout this manual, the rules abbreviate dice rolls with phrases like 3d6+1, which means three six-sided dice plus 1 (which generates a number between 4 and 19). In this method, the first number represent the number of dice to roll (all of which are added up), the number after the &ldquo;d&rdquo; lets you know what type of dice to use, and any number after this represents the quantity to be added or subtracted from the result.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/><br/>This overview will cover some of the basics a playing Chaos Realms. Other sections on this website will expand upon these basic concepts. It is not important to memorize the contents of this section to play the game, as to do so will surely cause madness and insanity. Use this book merely as a reference during play and have fun. <br/><br/>ROLLING DICE<br/><br/>Most dice rolls will be against a Difficulty Check, which determines the difficulty of the action the character wishes to accomplish. To do this, roll all the dice attributed to the relevant skill, add any situational or environmental modifiers and try to get a result that is equal to or greater than the DC of the desired action.<br/><br/>NOTE: Not all actions require a die roll.<br/><br/>Roll dice during combat, or scenarios in which the success of an action may become more difficult. However, if there is a situation in which roll-play can determine the outcome, then dice rolls are not necessary. Also, the Chaos Lord should reward those who rollplay out situations by giving them extra experience points. <br/><br/>ADDING MODIFIERS<br/><br/>When rolling dice to determine the outcome of certain actions you may be required to add or subtract one or more modifiers to your die roll. Modifiers may result from situational circumstances, environmental factors or faulty equipment. <br/><br/>GAINING EXPERIENCE<br/><br/>Experience (XP) is gained by the use of skills, defeating opponents and by completing quests. Except for XP earned from completing quests, experience earned go towards the skill in which the character used to earn the experience points. Therefore to become more skilled, you must simply use your skills more. Practice makes perfect.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, you can also earn additional XP by successfully completing missions, quests and campaigns. Each mission, or campaign, has a ranking between 1 and 6 (1 being the easiest and 6 being the most difficult quest imaginable). XP earned by successfully completing quests can be applied to any skill or attribute.<br/><br/>CHARACTER ACTIONS<br/><br/>Just as in real life, characters can try to do pretty much anything you can imagine. As long as the action fits the scenario and the CL allows, it can be done.<br/><br/>Characters can accomplish these actions by making ability or skill checks using one or more d6, depending on their skill ranking and adding any attribute, situational or environmental modifiers.<br/><br/>"}, "153058": {"rpgartist": ["Steven Armendariz", "Joel Cotejar", "Donny Gandakusuma", "Risa Hulett", "Pat Reilly", "Silvio Santos", "Todd VanHooser", "Susan VanHooser", "Anna-Liza Ybarra"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Adventures Under the Laughing Moon Role-Playing Game", "rpgdesigner": ["Todd VanHooser"], "rpgproducer": ["Todd VanHooser"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1886061.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Adventures Under the Laughing Moon"], "rpgpublisher": ["Laughing Moon Productions"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1886061_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Adventures Under the Laughing Moon is a fantasy role-playing game that introduces players to the world of Mythren where magic and danger are a part of everyday life.

Perhaps the trickiest area for this effort is that intersection of mundane melee combat and magical abilities. The classic tales we all know abound with heroes who mix swordplay and spellcasting, excelling at both but yet remaining believable, appropriately powered members of their worlds, but game rules often have a difficult time allowing a single character access to both martial and arcane traits without having them become overpowered.<br/><br/>The vanguard is a new base class designed for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The class blends martial and arcane power, focusing the character's skill and effort into mastering a single weapon with which he has a strong arcane bond. Spellcasting and martial combat become merged for the vanguard in a way that presents balanced game mechanics in a satisfying conceptual package. You can see in both his powers and their limitations echoes of the magical warriors whose exploits first fired our fascination with fantasy fiction and brought us to the gaming hobby in hopes of forging such adventures for ourselves.<br/><br/>Now updated with feedback from more than a year of comments, as well as expanded options to make the class even more flexible and customizable.

She is a hybrid spellcaster, combining arcane spells drawn from power within herself and the faith needed to also call upon divine spells. A magister may be a church wizard, a priestess of magic who has studied the arcane arts, or a dynamic spiritualist who sees no difference in the two traditional forms of magic. Magisters may be called bruxa, church mages, ecclesiathurges, ovates, spell lords, thaumaturges, white wizards, or other titles that suit the needs of your campaign.<br/><br/>A magister is considered both an arcane and divine spellcaster (and can count as either for purposes of requirements and prerequisites). The magister is similar to a sorcerer in that she draws spell power from within herself, casting a limited list of spells known with no need for advanced preparation. Unlike a sorcerer, a magister can draw from both arcane and divine spell lists when selecting spells known, allowing magisters to be prepared for a broader range of circumstances. This is important as the magisters focus is spells to the exclusion of nearly everything else, even more so than other spellcasting classes. Depending on the mystic bond a magister makes, she may not have powers beyond her spells, but instead she&rsquo;ll learn new ways to use the spells she knows to maximum benefit.<br/><br/><br/>(*)When this class was originally released in early 2010 in a product called The Genius Guide to the Magus, the class was presented the magus. Then, more than a year later, the book Ultimate Magic was released, with an &ldquo;official&rdquo; class named the magus &ndash; which looked nothing like our class of the same name. Sometimes picking an awesome name means other people will use it too!<br/><br/>To avoid confusion, we&rsquo;ve decided to rename our magus &ldquo;the magister.&rdquo; As we update our backstock of products we&rsquo;ll make the name change when referencing this class, but you should be aware that process takes time. For anything released in 2013 or later, a reference to the magus means the class from Ultimate Magic, and any reference to the class from this book will use the name &ldquo;magister.&rdquo; For books released before that, you&rsquo;ll need to check context to know if a Super Genius Games book talking about the magus really means a magus &ndash; the class from Ultimate Magic &ndash; or if it is actually talking about our class, the magister.<br/><br/>A magus is considered both an arcane and divine spellcaster (and can count as either for purposes of requirements and prerequisites).

Rather than require all monks to be masters of unarmed attacks and self-perfection, each monk can have custom-fit class abilities to match a player&rsquo;s specific concept. This greater flexibility allows the monk to be the default esoteric-combat-style-oriented character without limiting it to just one or two styles of fighting. Like a rogue, a talented monk character can pick and choose from a range of similarly-powered abilities appropriate for the monk&rsquo;s role, without making the class overpowered.

While this gives them a wide range of options, it can also lead to characters with specific sneak, criminal, or adventurer concepts having abilities they don&rsquo;t need, such as a wilderness scout being a master of urban traps, or an entirely scholarly researcher and archaeologist gaining a huge number of sneak attack dice. Rogues are supposed to be masters of picking up tricks of the trade, but half their class abilities are static bonuses with little customization.<br/><br/>The Genius Guide to the Talented Rogue rewrites the classic rogue class to use a system of edges and talents, rather than static class abilities alternating with talents. Edges represent the &ldquo;core&rdquo; features of each rogue, areas of study so intense and specialized that no rogue can master all of them, while the classic talent system has been expanded to include any rogue-like ability a character could reasonable pick up at any time with study.

Because some abilities (such as a ki pool) are not appropriate for every campaign, and some GMs dislike allowing abilities from multiple archetypes to be taken by a single character, when an ability is adapted from another class or an archetype, the name of that source is given as a descriptor.<br/><br/>"}, "153100": {"rpgartist": ["Lin Bo", "V.

They are weapons of war used by the magically inclined to blast away that which ails them. Where the swordmaster passes down his blade to his favorite student, so too does the master wizard pass his apeiron stave down to his star apprentice.<br/><br/>Apeiron staves are magical implements whose most basic function can be used without draining their magical reserves. While they are staff shaped, are magical, and have charges, that is where the comparison between an apeiron staff and a regular magical staff ends. Apeiron staves do not cast spells, but rather offer a number of augmentations to their basic effect. These augmentations do drain a separate reservoir, but even when this pool is empty, the apeiron staff can still be activated to use its basic effect.<br/><br/>Thanks! Now That I Know What They Are, Tell Me Why I Need An Apeiron Staff?<br/><br/>In the core rules, staves are treated as &ldquo;spells-in-a-can&rdquo; &ndash; a delivery mechanism for a specific number of abilities the user likely already possesses. Yes, they let you create impressive effects, but at the end of the day they are simply a different way to cast a spell. We already have potions, wands, scrolls, and a multitude of command-word items to do this. Why should the vast majority of magic item categories simply be different ways to cast a spell? That&rsquo;s where apeiron staves come in.<br/><br/>While most apeiron staves are offensively oriented, a fair number also exist to assist your allies. No longer shall a support character be faced with the question of what to do on some rounds. They can help give orders to their allies, boost their offensive capabilities, lift the burdens ailing their compatriots, and much more.<br/><br/>Cool! Last Thing... Apeiron Is A Crazy-Weird Word, Did You Just Make It Up?<br/><br/>Nope. The word apeiron is Ancient Greek for &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; or &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo;, or more literally &ldquo;without limit&rdquo; or &ldquo;without end&rdquo;. Perhaps its most famous user was the 6th century B.C. Greek natural philosopher Anaximander, which he used in his response to the Pre-Socratic natural philosophers of his age who were debating which element, Earth, Wind, Air, or Fire, was the basis of reality. Anaximander proposed that the basis of reality was actually the apeiron, or the infinite, and attributed a divine-like aspect to it. And so, much like how these staves create magic, he proposed that the universe was itself a creation of the apeiron. And that's why we think the name &ldquo;apeiron staves&rdquo; is appropriate for a type of magical staff that can continuously create a basic magic effect.<br/><br/>Besides, it just sound cool when you can have your character say &quot;Fear not this savage horde my friends, now that we have recovered my Apeiron Staff of the Spectral Hero, a mighty champion of legendary Mar'Kan shall fight with us this day!&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "153101": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["format testing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Herb's wiki  tag testing entry on RPGG", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1619928.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpg": ["Test RPG"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Non-Rankable Item (item will not show in the rankings)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1619928_t.png", "description": "this is for<br/><br/> <br/>Herb <br/>(herace)<br/><br/>United StatesGeorgia<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> to test wiki tag usage on the Geek<br/><br/><br/>BGG Guide for New Publisher Entries<br/><br/>BGG Guide to Publisher Corrections<br/><br/>BGG Guide to Version Corrections<br/><br/>BGG Guide to Game &quot;information&quot; Corrections<br/><br/>BGG Pending Queues for Users<br/><br/> Pending Board Game Queue<br/><br/>Boardgame Mechanics - Geeklists with mechanics that are not &quot;official&quot; BGG mechanics<br/><br/>Boardgame Characterizations -<br/><br/><br/>                                                                                            <br/>                                                                                        <br/>                                                                                    <br/>                                                                                <br/>                                                                            <br/>                                                                        <br/>                                                                    <br/>                                                                <br/>                                                            <br/>                                                        <br/>                                                    <br/>                                                <br/>                                            <br/>                                        <br/>                                    <br/>                                <br/>                            <br/>                        <br/>                    <br/>                <br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Boardgame Mechanics<br/><br/>Geeklists with mechanics that are not &quot;official&quot; BGG mechanics<br/><br/>the Tic Tac Toe Family Reunion - Win by getting n-in-a-row.<br/><br/>Pure Luck Games - Games which are pure luck.

Years of development have yielded a realistic football simulation that combines simple and elegant rules with unlimited depth and strategy. By focusing on one key play in each scoring drive, you play an entire football game in under 15 minutes. Every player, from your star quarterback to your under-appreciated right tackle, has their own player card; and each player has the ability to impact the result of every game.<br/><br/>Masters of the Gridiron can be played by anyone; even those who are new to the game of football. Intuitive rules mixed with tense competition gives this game an addictive edge you won't find in any other sports game.<br/><br/>History<br/><br/>Clay Dreslough, the game's lead designer, wrote his first dice-based sports simulation in 1976. He later discovered similar games from companies like Strat-O-Matic and Sports Illustrated, but he didn't enjoy them very much. It's tedious to spend several hours picking plays, flipping them over, rolling dice, looking up the results on a chart, rolling more dice, moving counters on the &quot;play clock&quot; and so on, just to resolve each play.<br/><br/>Instead, Clay created the award-winning Baseball Mogul and Football Mogul computer games, capable of simulating entire seasons in just a few minutes. We used this technology as the under-pinnings for Masters of the Gridiron -- to create realistic player ratings for over 680 current players, and to create realistic playbooks for all 32 teams.<br/><br/>Over the last four years, we have boiled down 26 pages of rules to the bare essentials, creating a head-to-head card game that feels like football.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>You choose your starting offensive and defensive players, and combine them with a playbook of 24 (or more) cards. You can pair an MVP quarterback with 3 superstar receivers, or focus on your offensive line and the running game. Choose a standard 4-3 defense, or add a nickel back to help stop a team built around the passing game.<br/><br/>Masters of the Gridiron encourages you to create your own customized deck, combining your favorite players and plays from multiple decks. Three simple rules govern the creation of your own customized team roster and playbook. This gives your freedom to build your offense around a power running game or a vertical passing game, and tailor your defense to pressure opposing quarterbacks or focus on forcing turnovers (to name just a few examples). Assemble an offensive juggernaut and try it out against your friend's shutdown defense -- the possibilities are limitless!<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with 3 offensive player cards, 3 defensive player cards, and 4 playbook cards. To mount a scoring drive, you match a playbook card to an offensive player with the appropriate skills (such as &quot;passing&quot; or &quot;run blocking&quot;) and lay them down on the table, announcing the player rating that your opponent needs to beat in order to stop your attempt to score. Their ability to stop you depends on a combination of their strategy decisions and the luck of the draw.<br/><br/>Players alternate possessions until &quot;time runs out&quot; (when each team has no more offensive player cards to draw). Along the way, you enjoy all the aspects of a real football game, from goal-line stands and two-point conversions to game-changing interceptions and last-minute field goals.<br/><br/>The playbook cards themselves are used to track your score. So the only thing you need to play are two decks (one per team) and 15 minutes of time.<br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>Each deck contains 54 high-quality full-color playing cards:<br/><br/>13 Offensive Player cards<br/>13 Defensive Player cards<br/>24 Offensive Playbook cards<br/>4 Defensive Playbook cards<br/>Each team includes their own printed card box for safekeeping. Our cards are also compatible with other card-storage boxes and sleeves, such as those used for collectible card games like Magic: The Gathering and Pokemon.<br/><br/>Licensing<br/><br/>Please note that Masters of the Gridiron is not licensed by the National Football League.

But is this the last move of the endgame, or the start of a new fight against terror?<br/><br/>What's New?<br/><br/>Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Rainbow Six 3: Iron Wrath is the second mission pack for Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield. As an upgrade for Raven Shield, it adds even higher levels of excitement and realism to the Rainbow Six experience. All the basic features of Raven Shield are present in Iron Wrath. Controls, gameplay, and game flow all remain the same. If you need to refresh your knowledge of how the basic game works, please refer to your original Raven Shield manual.<br/><br/>Among its new features, Iron Wrath includes a brand-new singleplayer campaign consisting of seven missions. You&rsquo;ll find the same team and the same equipment, plus six new real-world weapons. A detailed list of these new weapons appears in this manual.<br/><br/>Iron Wrath also provides a series of eight new multiplayer maps, playable with five new modes, to expand the online excitement of Raven Shield. These maps can also be played in Single Player from the Custom Mission screen.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Iron Wrath includes three classic missions. These totally revamped environments and missions are from the earliest chapters of the Rainbow Six saga.

Not just a rehash of d20 Modern,* Modern Adventures is a new take on fantasy gaming in a 21st century setting. Inside, you'll find:<br/><br/>     Updates to the existing Pathfinder core and NPC classes, bringing them into the 21st century.<br/>     6 brand new classes with 20 new archetypes. <br/>         Charmer: Masters of the social arts, charmers are masters of flattery and persuasion, using their innate appeal to deceive, manipulate, and bend others to their will.<br/>             Archetypes: Animal Whisperer, Gambler, Romancer, Undercover Spy<br/>        <br/>         Entertainer: Consummate performers, entertainers are happiest in front of an audience. They create and control the raw emotions of everyone around them. As they advance in levels they also gain status and influince.<br/>             Archetypes: Stand-up Comic, Pro Athlete, Stuntman<br/>        <br/>         Gadgeteer: Techies. Gearheads. Geeks. Rocket Scientists. Whatever you call them, gadgeteers are technological virtuosos, able to create short-lived gizmos - technology so advanced it makes &quot;cutting-edge&quot; look like a blunt rock.<br/>             Archetypes: Hacker, Racer, Saboteur<br/>        <br/>         Investigator: Investigators are tireless seekers of truth and insatiable puzzle-solvers, never content unless they're working a case. Using flashes of intuition as well as the scientific re-creation of crime scenes, no clue is beyond their reach.<br/>             Archetypes: Bounty Hunters, Gentleman Detective, Muckraker, Superfan<br/>        <br/>         Scholar: Part bookworm, part mad scientist, the scholar's primary advantage is their raw intellect which they can shape into various talents and tricks. They can also create concoctions that can have either beneficial or detrimental effects.<br/>             Archetypes: Engineer, Psychologist<br/>        <br/>         Stranger: Every culture produces individuals who ultimately live apart from it, strangers within their own lands. Whether driven away from society or choosing to live apart from their fellow man, strangers face scorn and derision wherever they go. Still, living outside the system lets them accomplish things that most 9-5ers can only dream about.<br/>             Archetypes: Drunken Bum, Parolee, Street Preacher, Traditional Tribal Warrior<br/>        <br/>    <br/>     New Skills<br/>     New Feats<br/>     Modern weapons, equipment, and vehicles.<br/>     2 campaign universes and sample adventures:<br/>         Fifth Realm: The nine worlds of Norse mythology are real... and on a collision course with Midgard, the fifth realm. Participate in the return of magic to the modern world. Explore 8 new dimensional planes and, most importantly, defend earth from magically adept alien invaders.<br/>         Silicon Gothic: A hard sci-fi universe completely devoid of magic, the near-future world of Silicon Gothic follows the dystopian footsteps of Bladerunner, Brazil, Escape From New York, Max Headroom, Metropolis, and Robocop. Corrupt and greedy corporations oppress their workers and bully the powerless government. You must learn to work the system or be crushed by it.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>(*) OK, a good deal of the equipment list is carried over from d20 Modern. You've got me.

Putting these disparate sources together, we have reconstructed most, but not all, of the opera referred to by its contemporaries as &ldquo;the Apotheosis of All Art.&rdquo;<br/><br/>This is what is certain: six nobles, one from each unveiled House, come to Davfanna Aldrena for the autumn session of the Senate. Four are barons; two are roadmen. As such, they do not possess their own castles in the capitol, and are assigned rooms at a quarterhouse &mdash; the Hidden Moon House of the title. This provides the conceit upon which the entire opera rests. Each noble comes to the Hidden Moon House with a desperate agenda, and their web of interconnections serves to entangle their agendas and spur those agendas forward to their inevitable conclusions.<br/><br/>But what we do not have are those conclusions. We do not know how the opera ends &mdash; outside, of course, the assumption of terrible tragedy. The vast majority of the surviving fragments and extratextual references are to the opera&rsquo;s first movement.

The goal of the game remains the same: Create valuable combinations shown on the scoring sheet and collect more points than everyone else to win.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 108 cards, with the numbers 1-6 each appearing 18 times. Each player starts with a hand of five cards. On a turn, a player has two choices:<br/><br/><br/>     Discard 0-5 cards from your hand, then draw that many cards plus one from the deck.

Fighting for two or more opposing sides, players butt heads in an ongoing planet-based low-scale military campaign for settlement sites and resource extraction points ranging across the surface of the planet. As the campaign progresses, players can fill out their rosters of troops and equipment, training soldiers for service in specialized missions and requesting and receiving special-purpose hardware and software.<br/><br/>The overall course of the conflict is set by the players, who act behind the scenes to guide their faction&rsquo;s overall strategic aims. Players may attempt to &lsquo;buy&rsquo; strategic developments, whether geographic gains on a battle map or technical developments of military hardware, by incurring in-game costs measured in specific tactical mission successes under narrowly tailored conditions, representative of a supporting campaign of similar missions. The opposing player, then, may attempt to hamper or prevent such a development, again by incurring a mission cost. Players may establish new outposts, which can be captured as strongpoints and for their resources, and may operate manufacturing plants and research and development facilities to support the war effort.<br/><br/>Modifiers to technical support actions such as manufacturing and research arise from the geographic and military situation on the abstracted strategic map, which can be changed in its military aspect by players&rsquo; strategic developments, whether physically or technically. Similarly, modifiers to upcoming missions arise from past missions, and opposing players&rsquo; goals in tactical battles may be widely divergent depending on their overall war aims, which will often center on considerations of supply.<br/><br/>Initiative-based tactical battles take place on a hex-gridded battle board between multiple jumpsuit combatants individually controlled by the players, sometimes in conjunction with semicontrolled aligned vehicles and facilities.

Over the course of his or her presidency, each player not only strives to stay in power, weathering incessant calls for elections and the ubiquitous coup attempts, but also works to build up his or her island to become a powerhouse of commerce, whether through tourism, manufacture, or production.<br/><br/>But politics always interferes. Political life on the island is torn between the heavyhanded interference of the nearby capitalistic superpower and the activism of neighboring communist nations, and your people aren&rsquo;t as singleminded in their political views as you are. Factions within your economy will undoubtedly work against your goals, perhaps even against you personally. Political opponents will rise, maybe fall, and all the while you&rsquo;ll be trying to keep the country afloat when hurricanes hit and embargos hit even harder.<br/><br/>Better than just afloat, though&mdash;profitable. Because without profits, your slush fund will get emptier the longer it sits. Living from foreign aid to foreign aid is no life for a president, even one canny enough to be playing both superpowers against the middle. And if you overstay your political welcome in the region, if you let your economy founder, if things go south for any of a thousand reasons and you find yourself packing your bags, you&rsquo;ll need something in your pocket when you&rsquo;re gone.

All in pursuit of one thing: your place in history. The best presidents live long, live well, and live in security. Achieve all three, and you&rsquo;ll consider it a job well done.

Starting from the very edge of the mountain, you &ndash; a mage on a mission &ndash; must use your powers not only to make your way to the centre, but also to impede and slow down your opponents through myriads of magical trickery - rotating their mazes into dead ends, burning their caverns, or even outright destroying what they create - all in order to ensure that the only wizard making it to the centre is you and you alone. But beware, not only do you have to make it to the centre, you have to make it out again.<br/><br/>With up to 3 other mages trying to stop you, that may not be such an easy feat!<br/><br/>The rules for Mazemaster are simple. At the beginning of every turn, players select up to three action cards they wish to use once the turn begins. These could be anything from as simple as move and build to cards that allow a player to rotate other player&rsquo;s maze tiles, teleport them across unbridgeable gaps or even to destroy their path altogether. Each player, when selecting the actions they are going to take, can&rsquo;t just think about what they plan to do; they also have to remember to try and slow down any player that may be ahead of them, or even preparing for a dastardly piece of magical trickery coming their way from an opponent, even as they try to make their way to the centre of the map, wherein lies the relic.<br/><br/>Reaching the relic, however, isn&rsquo;t the end; your wizard has his powerful new weapon, but he needs to get out of the mountain in order to understand how to use it!

What suits you use does not matter. Aces have a value of one.<br/><br/>SET UP: shuffle the cards then lay them face up in a circle or square to form the track. Then one player decides to be Odd, the other Even. Both take three tokens. Odd places one token on the odd numbered cards of the same number, either all the aces, threes or fives.

Who moves which token doesn't matter, only that the Odd player moves an odd number of spaces, and Even an even number, both moving in a clockwise manner.

An odd number scores points for Odd, an even number for Even, regardless of who moved the token. For example, if Odd moves a token on a 5 card, but is forced to hop over an occupied space in the way, this equals six spaces moved, so Even receives six points, though it was not his or her turn.

Each player takes control of one of the four animal factions: pigs, goats, cows, or chickens. Each faction has its own barn and special attributes that impact gameplay.<br/><br/>Each faction has three Generals that move around the farm harvesting crops and marshaling troops. Initially, the Generals can harvest only the least valuable resource: grass. Players must spend their resources in order to marshal new troops, which unlock the ability to harvest better resources, e.g., a donkey allows its General to harvest corn. Players work their way toward harvesting the most scarce resources so they can marshal the most powerful troops. Each General can command only five Troops, so players often specialize the Generals based on their location, nearby threats, and distance from their barn.<br/><br/>The farm is an 8x8 randomly tiled board containing crops, obstacles, and empty fields. When setting up the board, a small 4x4 grid is laid out randomly, and each player positions his barn anywhere along the perimeter of the grid. The rest of tiles are then randomly laid down to form the final 8x8 board. When choosing a starting location, players must consider the available resources, distance to neighbors, and the faction's special abilities.<br/><br/>In addition to the common Troops, each faction may also marshal Special Forces. Each Special Force Troop gives the faction a distinct advantage: chickens gain a movement bonus, cows gain a defensive bonus, pigs gain a harvesting bonus, and goats gain an attacking bonus. Players also have three hidden Command Cards that they may play at any time to gain an advantage or get out of a tough situation. The Command Cards range in effects and are very valuable when used appropriately.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to destroy the other factions and take control of the farm. Players achieve this by forming a Super Army and triggering the end game. At any time a player may choose to form a Super Army if all of their General are in their barn. The Super Army combines all of the player&rsquo;s Troops together under a single General. This massive army gets an attack, defense, and movement bonus, but cannot harvest resources or marshal Troops. Forming a Super Army triggers the end game as the only effective strategy against a Super Army is to form one of your own.

Humanity has become part of a Galactic Council of a precarious nature, wrought with nefarious alien races all watching the other with incredulity and disdain. The Council has adjourned from a meeting that has left the members&hellip;&hellip;at odds, to say the least. Having already been dispatched, you take the role of commander of a small strike force representing your race and its enthralling stake in an archaic space station orbiting Earth. Equipped with unique and outlandish weaponry, abilities of extraordinary and marvelous effect, and the luck of the die, you will battle other players and the perils on board the station in a race to complete your missions and grasp victory.<br/><br/>Game-Play: In Xenofaction, you control one of the many playable alien races with 3 four man squads at your disposal. Each with unique weaponry, abilities and styles of play. The board is made  of a hex grid making movement very easy and fluid. Weapons ranging is also based on this hex grid, for example; if a weapon has a range of 4, you count 4 hexs in the direction you are shooting from the attacking unit to the defending unit. The flow of game play if fluent and smooth as each unit completes its actions before you move to the next. Players take turns moving their units aboard the station and taking actions when necessary or desired. What stands out about Xenofaction is in between each players turn, another player will get the chance to control the station units (generally NPC's in a computer game). So instead of a computer autonomously controlling the actions of these type of units, players will get the chance to act as a sort of pseudo A.I. Action cards are used to create unique events and spur of the moment tactics, as well as useful items and bonuses to units.<br/><br/>Goal: The way to win in Xenofaction is to simply gain enough victory points. These points are gained by accomplishing numerous tasks. First there are universal missions you can try to complete that are active for every player. Each mission can only be completed by each player once, but another player completing a mission does not make it unavailable for others. Next is sometimes even more fun and necessary than the missions. Each unit you kill or destroy, except your own, gives you victory points, each being worth a designated amount.

Of Dungeons Deep! takes a brave new look at a classic theme, is easy to learn, and employs simultaneous play which equates to almost zero downtime for players!<br/><br/>We are proud to announce that ALL the artwork for Of Dungeons Deep! has been commissioned by the fabulous Derek Bacon. Mr. Bacon has worked on such titles as Tower, Baldrick's Tomb, and Smash Monster Rampage. His style is both playful and edgy, and we feel it is the perfect match for the game. Plus his name is BACON so.....<br/><br/>Bluffing and Blind Bidding. Players are attempting to destroy the nasty creatures below in the dungeon to gain fame by playing cards face down and revealing simultaneously. Each enemy has a set number of hit points based on the number of players. There are three enemies to deal with in each level of the dungeon, so strategy, tactics, and bluffing are a must. There is also two rounds of bidding so players gain insight into what other players are up to.<br/><br/>Deck Building. When a player defeats an enemy, that card is rotated 180 degrees and then added to the player's discard pile. The bottom of each monster card indicates what item the enemy is carrying. These items add power to your character in future rounds, and act as an organic and thematic way to show that your characters are advancing.<br/><br/>Draft Your Unique Party. Before play begins, players complete a draft in order to create their starting hand of twelve cards. Each player gets one Hero and one Henchman.

A doom token and a fate token are placed at opposite ends of the overlord track, and you lose if the doom and fate tokens ever meet on the overlord track. Doom is an inescapable force that slowly progresses when the heroes fail encounters and in other ways. Fate, on the other hand, is a fluctuating force that the heroes affect both positively and negatively based on their progress.

After the war ended many Confederates said that the South would rise again. Now with the help of Wallet Battles their dream can come true.<br/><br/>Wallet Battles essentially takes an old Civil War coin flipping game and combines it with the new micro board game concept to create a fun interactive game that can be enjoyed over and over wherever you go.<br/><br/>Game Overview: <br/>Wallet Battles is a micro board game for two that is played on a plastic card that has battle maps available on both sides of the card. Players flip coins to earn the right to perform actions that will help them battle for ownership of various locations on the map. The key objective is to have the most points by the end of the game. To achieve this objective you need to control as much of the map as possible and build stacks of coins to strengthen your defenses.<br/><br/>Setup: <br/>Place the map you wish to use face up between both players. Now divide equally between both players a handful of coins. We recommend 6 quarters, 6 nickels, 6 dimes and 6 pennies for optimal play, however, any amount of coins can be used to manipulate the length of play.<br/><br/>Decide who wants to represent the Confederates (Tails) and who wants to represent the Union (Heads).  If needed, a regular coin flip can be used to decide for you.<br/><br/>Play: <br/>Each turn begins with both players flipping a coin onto a table. Each flip has three potential outcomes:<br/>Heads: Both coins show heads.<br/>Tails: Both coins show tails.<br/>Odd: One head and one tail is shown.<br/><br/>If the coins land on Heads the player representing the Union can place one of his coins on the map or if his opponent already has coins on the map he may capture one of his coins to place in his pile for later placement.<br/><br/>If the coins land on Tails the player representing the Confederacy can place one of his coins on the map or if his opponent already has coins on the map he may capture one of his coins to place in his pile for later placement.<br/><br/>If the coins land Odd the coin flip must be repeated. No other action is required, however, if Odd is flipped three times in a row all players must remove a coin from the map and return it back to their pile.<br/><br/>To strengthen your defenses you must build stacks of coins. Smaller coins must go on top of larger coins. Therefore, if your base coin is a dime you won&rsquo;t be able to build a stack. You can&rsquo;t build on your opponents stack, however, you can capture coins from him.<br/> Game End:<br/>The game ends when all coins have been captured, your opponent is out of coins  or when all possible locations on the map have been used. Players earn 2 points for every location they control and 1 point for every coin located on the map. Stacks of coins consisting of three or more coins will be doubled in value. Any coins not used will be counted as 1 point. The player with the most points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "153242": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1906274.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["A Song of Ice and Fief (fan expansion for Fief 1429)"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Philippe Mouchebeuf"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Fief: France 1429 \u2013 Expansions Pack"], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamepublisher": ["Academy Games", "ASYNCRON games", "Ediciones MasQueOca", "Giochix.it"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1906274_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Medieval", "Negotiation", "Territory Building"], "description": "Fief: France 1429 is a game of dynastic ambition, where players assume the roles of nobles in the 15th century Kingdom of France.<br/><br/>Templars is an expansion of the game Fief: France 1429 that includes new cards, counters and a Templar board.<br/><br/>A lord can become Templar and build commanderies (headquarters) or raise troops in villages, but he needs to pay attention to not threaten the King's dominance.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English/French edition", "German First edition", "Italian First edition", "Spanish First edition"], "average": "7.82", "name": "Fief: France 1429 \u2013 Templars Expansion", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Partnerships", "Trading"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["Fief: France 1429"], "usersrated": "45", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Board Game Interview Room with Uwe Eickert"]}, "153243": {"rpgartist": ["Pierre Legay"], "rpg": ["DramaSystem"], "poll": [], "name": "Honor Among Thieves", "rpgdesigner": ["John Wick"], "rpgproducer": ["Craig Hargraves", "Robin D.

It is essentially a simplification of Quadrille, itself a four-player adaptation of Ombre. As in Quadrille, players bid for the privilege of declaring trumps and deciding whether to play alone or with a partner.<br/><br/>Each player receives 8 cards dealt in 3-2-3, with two dealt to the  blind (received by the winning bidder). Aces rank high and tens rank low. The queen of clubs or spadille is always the highest trump, and the queen of spades or baste is always the third highest trump. Both do not count as members of their natural suits. The trump seven or manille is elevated to the rank of second highest trump. Below that the cards rank normally, except for omitting the queen if it is black. Thus depending on whether the trump suit is black or red, it contains 10 or 9 cards. Black plain suits contain 7 cards, and red plain suits contain 8 cards.<br/><br/>Bidding and scoring are complicated and not uniform. Bidding begins with the player to the left of the dealer. To bid, a player declares &quot;I can play&quot; (at least a 5 bid). The next bidder to bid either passes or declares &quot;I can play too&quot; (at least 5 clubs or 6). Once all but one player has passed, that player can declare a suit and call for an ace of another suit to be partner or decide to play &quot;solo&quot;.<br/><br/>Scoring can be point based or played using dimes and nickels. The bidding and scoring hierarchy is as follows.<br/><br/>5 hearts, diamonds, or spades - 5 cents<br/>5 clubs (called &quot;better&quot; when bidding) - 10 cents<br/>6-8 bids increase the bid by 5 cents per level<br/>solo bids outrank regular bids andearn more money because everyone pays the bidder (in partner games, both the bidder and the partner get paid on winning or pay out on loosing).<br/><br/>Trick-play is as in Whist. Player to the left of the dealer leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible; if not they can play anything. Whoever played the highest trump, or the highest card of the suit led, wins the trick and leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>Bidder's, i.e. declarer as a soloist or together with his or her partner, must win the number of tricks bid. If bidder's party wins all tricks to the number bid, they can stop the game and get a bonus for prime.

It was released in Japan on March 29, 2001 and later in North America on April 16, 2001. Despite being financially unsuccessful, this game received a worldwide cult following for its notable combination of nonlinear gameplay elements (e.g. trap detection) and bizarre B-movie style comedy horror theme, dialogue and voice acting.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The gameplay of Illbleed differs from other survival horror games. The player is encouraged to not rush through the level, but to slowly walk from place to place, looking around and at the environment. Using a tool named the Horror Monitor that consumes the player's adrenaline, the player can mark various places suspected of being a trap. These traps burn, slice, scare, and hit the player in various different ways, resulting in blood loss, rise of pulse, and lowered stamina so that means that even the environment itself is a threat to the player, in addition to the enemies.<br/>The player is given tools and items to prevent the character from bleeding to death, running out of strength or adrenaline, or being scared to death. If the player fails to keep the character alive through the course of the level, they must be revived outside of the level and has to continue the level with another character. If the player runs out of characters, then the game ends.<br/><br/>Battle<br/><br/>When engaging enemies, the player is not allowed to exit the battlefield until the enemies are cleared out. If the player tries to go beyond the battlefield, it will flash blue. In some cases, the battlefield has a smaller green square with a letter &quot;H&quot; on it; a helicopter hovers over the area (even indoors and when a concrete roof is above you in 'the homerun of death'). The player may attempt an escape by standing on the green square and pushing the B button repeatedly to call for help. Successful escape clears out the enemies.<br/><br/>Four senses and horror monitor.<br/><br/>A character has four senses: Sight, hearing, smell and sixth sense. Each time the player gets near items or traps, one or multiple senses will register on the meter located on the top of the screen these senses are indicated like a heart monitor. The player may utilize the horror monitor, which consumes adrenaline, to mark the spots suspected of hoarding items, traps or lurking enemies. Any spot marked will display a glowing blue orb, which the player can survey. Some traps will be successfully defused this way and the spent adrenaline will be returned to the character.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Illbleed&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "153292": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1890911.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Nobody is Perfect"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bertram Kaes"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "14", "boardgamepublisher": ["Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1890911_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Party Game"], "description": "Nobody Is Perfect: Mini Edition features the same game play as the original Nobody is Perfect &ndash; first released in 1996, then released in a new edition in 2009 &ndash; but with 300 new terms for players to puzzle over.<br/><br/>Game play is similar to Balderdash or the public domain &quot;Dictionary&quot; game with players being presented with an unusual word or image that they're unlikely to know.

I bet that dragon has a big hoard-a-gold.&quot;<br/><br/>- Random elderly villager<br/><br/>This is a continuation of the Cave System battle map that has been released previously.  The two can be used in conjunction with one another, or completely separately.  This particular map was built with two access points to reach the dragon's lair, either by climbing up the sheer cliffs of the mountain, or braving the caves themselves until you reach the dragon's den.  Neither way is safe, and the ultimate goal is probably far more dangerous, but what kind of adventure would it be if it weren't dangerous?<br/><br/>The secret to beating any dragon is strategy and teamwork.  This map was built with that in mind, giving the players multiple natural formations to assist them with their strategy.  There are, of course, plenty of stalagmites, but there is also a running stream which provides some noise cover and has even carved a niche in the limestone of the cave floor, permitting small or stealthy creatures to hide inside the stream niche itself.  In addition to that, there are multiple alcoves, all standing anywhere from 12' to 25' above the main cavern floor.  Some are accessible through the many cave tunnels in the mountain, others are only accessible by climbing up the sheer walls of the cavern.  One and all, they can be perfect attack points for ranged characters like archers or wielders of magic.  And if things get too hairy, the characters can always retreat into the safety of the tunnels, knowing no dragon could be large enough to fit in there.

So whatever your needs, you'll be able to find something in this trio.<br/><br/>First, we have Mercury - largest of the three at 155 feet. This is a Progress Level 8 prototype: a mix of human and Aleerin technology captained by self-styled hero known as &quot;The Shepard&quot;. He and his beautiful sidekicks are out to do good and, more importantly, win fame for themselves and Project Quicksilver (which produced the craft). Equipped with an advanced cloaking screen, an inertial flux engine, ablative armored skin, and zero bore cannons, Mercury is light-years ahead of the usual ships you'll find cruising the space lanes.<br/><br/>Next up is Remora-18, a salvaged boarding craft that is being used by a sadistic gang of cyber-punks to hunt civilian craft deep in the void. This beast employs magnetic grapples to lock onto the hull of a ship and then engages its breaching bore to burn a hole through which the rampaging gang can board. The 100 foot long ship is PL 6 and ugly as sin but gets the job done. Like Mercury, it supports a crew of three and a like number of passengers. The hold also has plenty of room for a boarding party to gather.<br/><br/>Lastly, we present the Valkyrn interceptor. At 74 feet this PL 7 craft is one step beyond a heavy fighter and carries a crew of four in its cramped interior. Valkyrn Bravo-6 is stationed out of Port Bastion - tasked with patrolling the hinterlands of known space to watch for hostile incursions and provide a first line of defense if needed. It is also authorized to conduct police duties as required. The ship is fast, well-armed, and also streamlined for atmospheric flight.

This station, known as Port Jericho, is much smaller than Argos III but still has a little bit of everything crammed into its habitation ring.

The roll result is added to the ability being trained.  A general workout can improve all abilities by a few points. While specific training can garner a larger increase in points, But a cost of points to other untrained areas. Each instructor has 3 areas they focus on and will add points to those abilities as well. Each student can only &ldquo;workout in the dojo&rdquo; once in-between official tournament matches.<br/><br/>There are two types of matches: Regular and Official. Regular matches are like official mathces, But are just for practice or exhibition. Wins &amp; Loses are not recorded but students can still sustain injuries.

The players control the martial artists by selecting which offensive or defensive move they want to execute and the computer determines the results based on the competitors' abilities scores.<br/><br/>Successful attacks earns the student judges' points and progress points.

Stu and his family started to mutate gaining claws and slowly losing most of their senses except for an acute sense of touch. They began to have the urge to escape and used their claws to burrow through the bomb shelter and break into the earth. The earth felt good to move through and they found they could hold their breath for a long time now.

There are heroes in here for you to add to your campaign&rsquo;s background as allies for your players, and some characters who would easily be used as villains as well. Or flip things around and have your players take on the roles of villains, and use these and other heroes against them!<br/><br/>Special highlights in this issue include contributions from Leon Chang, Rick Jones (Due Vigilance: Six Gun) and Steve Perrin (Amazing Stories of WWII: Homefront Heroes, and Homefront Villains)!
