His background in naval tactics, ship design, and history made him the perfect choice to write the story, and it proved to be wildly popular.

But his story was also rooted in the past (including the use of poison gas), and concluded with a Jutland-style clash between the two great fleets.<br/><br/>Designer Bob Eldridge has transformed Bywater's novel into a gaming supplement of 30 scenarios for Command at Sea. Ship statistics include not only real-world units like the pre-war US and Japanese battleships, but also the ships that Mr. Bywater created for his story - the Alaska-class aircraft carriers and the Nagasaki-class supersubmarine. In addition he has included scenarios for another three campaigns, each determined by different historical events in 1926, 1932, and 1939.

His crew generally consists of lower cost models such as the Guild Guards. Even his &quot;heavy hitters&quot; do not pump out a lot of damage on their own, but rely on a combined arms approach. He, of everyone in the Guild, supports his crew the most and loses well over half of his capability when not running his own crew. His limited crew of Guardsmen and Elite Division can pull off some cool &quot;alpha strike&quot; tactics, but it's pretty tricky to make them work. Focusing on any single part of his crew can take it apart quickly and make it tougher to play.<br/><br/>Overall, Lucius crew is all about the whole being greater than the sum of it's parts. For the most part your crew will be made of very &quot;average&quot; models (average movement, average attack, average resilience), but can be made to work very well by using a combined arms approach.<br/><br/>The Elite Division box comes with 1 Guild Guard (4 SS), Ryle (8 SS), the Guild Guard Captain (7 SS) and a Lawyer (7 SS), for a total of 26 Soulstones (plus Lucius' cost of 10 SS if not leading the crew). The starter box thus gives you a very top-heavy crew, with a trio of high-cost minions. Lucius tends to work best when he has a good number of minions around him however, so your first purchases should definitely be cheaper models with which to replace one of the 7-8SS minions in small games.<br/><br/>Your first purchase after the starter box should definitely be a pack of Guild Guard, who are cheap, resiliant and decent in both melee and ranged combat. Adding at least one Austringer is recommended to begin with. Good early buys are a blister of Guild Guard, a second Austringer and one of the Totems. Which one you choose depends on your play style, but if in doubt the Drill Sergeant has several different uses.<br/><br/>Lucius is trickier than a normal Guild Master due to his reduced list options, but can do well if you use the right pieces at the right time.<br/><br/>"}, "138608": {"poll": [], "name": "Malifaux: Exorcist", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven"], "yearpublished": "0", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1577939_t.jpg", "average": "1", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wyrd Miniatures"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1577939.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Miniatures"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:<br/><br/>The Exorcist is a minion for the Guild.<br/><br/>With a walk of 3&rdquo; and no charge the Exorcist is one of the slowest Guild models.

The main goal is to kill the opponent's King. Each army consists of 26 numbered men, 2 warhorses. Your army including axe-men, spearmen, swordsmen, archers, an engineer, horsemen and 1 king, all with different and balanced attributes. The fighting/attacking mechanism is an elegant 1 to 3 custom dice rolling system. Each player has the exact same army, similar to Chess, as to see which player really has superior strategic skills. Asymmetrical games can also be played with endless scenarios.<br/><br/>Each player has an &quot;Army Map&quot; sheet for his army which illustrates and keeps track of each warrior and warhorse. Each man in your army has his own health meter, skills, attributes, and even a place for the player to name them. This gives an unparalleled  up-close-and-personal view from the battlefield. Engineers are a big part of the game, they can cut down trees, construct archer towers to enhance their attack range, walls, fire trenches and even make extra arrows for your archers. The concept of fire, from fire arrows and fire trenches symbolized by &quot;wild fire&quot; tiles are also a big part of the game.

The Carpo installation (destroyed with antimatter charges 1 AF), the devastating outbreaks on Zeus Station and the Adrastea mining platforms, as well as the mysterious fate of the Synnott base on Io provide ample evidence. Still, compared to the devastation on Earth, Luna and Mars and the megaengineering at Iapetus the Jupiter system seems almost suspiciously free of TITAN artefacts. This is of course wrong: the TITANs were quite busy at the largest mass concentration outside the sun; it was just that most of their activities were hidden from transhumanity.<br/><br/>One of the artefacts constructed by the TITANs was a floating factory in the Jovian atmosphere. It might not be the only one (even though it is enormous, it is dwarfed by the giant planet and hidden under clouds and electric discharges) but this is the only one discovered by transhumans. It is a treasure, trap and threat all in one.<br/><br/>During their rapid evolution the TITANs at one point were considering seeding the solar system with self-replicating technology and turn it into a Matrioshka brain. Before long they advanced beyond that stage and began to explore more advanced femtotech, the gates and other incomprehensible technologies. But some early systems remained. The factory is one such early transcendent artefact: amazingly powerful, but still merely ultra-advanced nanotechnology and superintelligence rather than something truly alien.<br/><br/>The installation was discovered by gas miners from Owen Deuterium Solutions a few years. Knowing what was best for them, they quietly and urgently informed the Jovian Republic navy. The navy immediately moved in to maintain total security and secrecy, setting up project &ldquo;Indigo Longitude&rdquo;. The aims were 1) to prevent any danger from the installation, 2) keep other groups from discovering it, and 3) to investigate it.<br/><br/>Indigo Longitude is now run under the double cover of a Jovian Republic Naval Research Agency-run gas mining and energy production experiment codenamed Cloudy Trombone. Cloudy Trombone operates a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; floating gas mining aerostat, Jovanovich, hovering in the upper Jovian atmosphere, apparently experimenting with deep atmosphere tethers. Owen Deuterium Solutions was bought by the Republic and is operating Jovanovich. The work at the aerostat is real and of some military relevance to the navy, so the cover is not too implausible. That engineers, scientists and other personnel is shipped down to the aerostat under great secrecy looks just like typical military paranoia. In reality they are then shipped further down using the tether to Indigo Latitude, where the real work takes place.<br/><br/>"}, "138630": {"rpgdesigner": ["Anders Sandberg"], "rpg": ["Eclipse Phase"], "statistics": [], "name": "Lurking in Every Flower", "rpgartist": ["Anders Sandberg", "Wikimedia Commons"], "rpgproducer": ["Anders Sandberg"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1577247.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Crime (Conspiracy)", "Science Fiction (Hard Sci Fi)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1577247_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>Viscaria is a new petal that has been introduced by Xia Mandava, a young petal designer associated with Carnival of the Goat. The idea was to create a group petal, helping people to bond together and explore their subconscious memories. By petal standards it is almost retro: fake amnesia, a bit of psychodrama hallucinations, a networked trance, a gradual awakening/ascension. Xia&rsquo;s mentor Jack &ldquo;Brassinosteroid&rdquo; Chory felt that it was good enough to release, but suggested that next petal could be a bit wilder.<br/><br/>However, Viscaria had a major bug nobody noticed. It accidentally produces distributed minds. Users who trip on the petal will envision other people, imbuing them with motivations and abilities that fit their memories and expectations. In group mode several minds will work together to create even better visions. So well, in fact, that these fictional persons become far more coherent and smart than mere dream characters. They are running on the substrate of the petallinked minds, can use the intelligence, knowledge and skills of the users and even develop their own volition. The main reason this works is that the petal simply taps into the routines used normally during dreaming, amplifying them using some off-the shelf subconsciousness manipulation software and the networking capabilities of the petal.<br/><br/>It does not scale terribly well &ndash; the petal cannot handle too many people, and the joint subconscious dissolves at the end. However, the fictional people created do not fade quite as easily. They become reinforced within each user&rsquo;s mind, and next time they will pop out again. This time they will be even more aware and able, likely conscious of their own situation and able to exploit it.<br/><br/>Most fictional people created this way are harmless: projections of close friends, relatives, perhaps a celebrity. They are their quirks, little more than caricatures that go about their business. But some become ambitious. Maybe they are more of projections of shared fears, uncertainties and drives (such as staying alive). They can use their status to implant ideas and spread from mind to mind. They know they are not real people and that they only exist when people are tripping. So they make plans to get people to trip more on Viscaria, get people with the right skillsets to trip, and slowly build their plans for taking over.<br/><br/>In particular, one fictional, &ldquo;Dark Ron&rdquo;, has managed to take over at least one host and is now on his way to wreak vengeance against his creator.

Warzone Resurrection is a fast paced, exciting and tactical miniature game created by Prodos Games Ltd. and Paraodox Entertainment.<br/><br/>The Warzone Resurrection project brings the tabletop game well and truly into the 21st century. Lovingly, we have taken essence and best bits from the game, art and prose of previous editions to produce all new miniatures, a background re-imagining (by Warzone mega-fan and writing genius, Andy Hoare) and an exciting innovative gaming system.<br/><br/>The gaming system involves both miniatures and cards. The minis are your skirmish force and the cards represent game resources, additional wargear, global and local effects on the battlefield etc.. In a real battle it is likely that a soldier wouldn't know his opponents wargear, whether they have grenades or a laser-sight for example. Both sides might be surprised by a Martian earthquake or Mercurian solar flare. The Venusian jungle cover you are in might be better (or worse) than you thought! War is rarely predictable, especially when it takes place on the planets, planetoids and asteroids of the solar system! All these and many more variables are represented by the cards you and your opponent play.

Although infantry play an important role, they are not the primary focus of the game. A typical game will consist of one to five armored vehicles and, three to seven squads of infantry or support units.<br/><br/>The game is designed to play like a WWII simulation. Every effort was taken to use and distill actual WWII vehicle and combat data in the creation of the vehicle stats and game play. Unlike modern warfare, not every shot will hit its target and many hits will not penetrate your opponent&rsquo;s armor and result in an instant kill. Two evenly matched vehicles may find themselves in an extended engagement, trading shot for shot until one finds a soft spot and makes the kill.<br/><br/>The decision to base the play style and game mechanics on a more antiquated technology was a conscious one, born from the desire to add more depth to the combat than a simple &ldquo;Roll D6, four or better, you kill your target&rdquo;. Vehicles, regardless of the manufacturer represent more of a financial investment than infantry units do. With this in mind, the number of large units required to play Iron-Core have been reduced as the vehicle and infantry survivability has been extended to a more descriptive and cinematic feel.<br/><br/>Our goal is to provide a game system that rewards tactics and punishes suicide runs. Applying bonuses and penalties based on unit position, unit formations, moral, and support fire and tactics; you will find that an inferior force can defeat a superior force with the application of some tactical forethought. Many of optional rules may slow play but highly recommended.<br/><br/>There are many game systems available, each have their own strengths, weaknesses and focus. If you are looking for a brigade level combat game, Iron-Core may not be the best choice. If you want a dynamic vehicle vs. vehicle combat system where having the biggest and the best does not equate to an &ldquo;I win&rdquo; button, then Iron-Core may be the game for you.<br/><br/>"}, "138693": {"boardgamedesigner": ["K.

These &lsquo;variants&rsquo; allow for further customization of classes with a minimum risk of powergaming or min\u2010maxing.<br/><br/>Heroes of Lore provides 52 of these class variants in order to enhance play for any d20 based game. Though Heroes of Lore is designed for use with Blood &amp; Treasure, it can easily be adapted to any gaming system of your choice with minimal hassle.<br/><br/>These variants range from a simple idea like a Spy, to more complex roles like a Totem Warrior or a Psionicist.

The attract-mode screen displays the name &quot;Star Fire&quot; in a swooping sans-serif typeface similar to the Star Wars logo. The primary enemies in the game are spaceships that are virtually indistinguishable from TIE fighters. The player's primary weapon is an array of 4 lasers that fire in an &quot;X&quot; pattern, implying that the player is flying a ship configured similarly to an X-Wing. Notwithstanding these similarities, Star Fire was not officially licensed to use the Star Wars trademarks.<br/><br/>Star Fire's on-screen graphics are brightly colored blues, greens, and reds. This was an unusual feature in 1979 and the graphics made it stand out from many other arcade games of the era.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The player controls whether his ship is moving forward or backwards via a Thrust Control lever and a Steering Yoke is used to control the player's ship. The controls are loose and somewhat floaty; nimble moves are not possible. The player has a button that fires his Laser Beam at the center of the screen. The lasers travel slowly, taking about 2 seconds to reach their target, and only one &quot;shot&quot; can be on screen at once. Furthermore, each shot the player fires causes heat to build up in his ship. If the player's rate of fire is too high, his guns will overheat and he will need to wait for them to cool down.<br/><br/>If the player can maneuver such that an enemy TIE fighter-like ship is directly in the crosshair gunsight, the targeting computer will &quot;lock on&quot; and any shots fired will automatically hit. When the player successfully shoots an enemy fighter, the screen prints &quot;GOT HIM&quot;. Occasionally, a thinner, horizontally oriented ship that looks like a Viper from Battlestar Galactica will be seen. These have &quot;Exidy&quot; written on their tails, and are worth the largest amount of points. If the player successfully shoots this ship, the screen displays &quot;GOT US&quot;. These ships cannot be locked onto.<br/><br/>The game is timed. The more quarters the player puts in, the longer he can play. As the player shoots enemy ships, they increase in point value, and also in elusiveness. If the player reaches certain point thresholds, he is given more &quot;fuel&quot; and can thus play longer. The player's ship can be shot by the enemies; this simply resets the quality of enemies (and thus their point value) down to the lowest level.<br/><br/>Other Notable Features<br/><br/>Star Fire was the first arcade game to allow a player to enter his or her initials in to the high score table (the current high score record is 9,780 points, set by Laura Curran of Las Vegas in January 1982). Star Fire was also one of the first games to allow the player to partially damage an enemy with a glancing shot.<br/><br/>Star Fire can be run (emulated) on a PC by the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator. It is one of the few games that has legally released for use on the MAME emulator, along with its unreleased update, Star Fire II.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Star Fire&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License, supplemented by information from Exidy's Star Fire Operator's Manual.<br/><br/>"}, "138707": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Elad Goldsteen"], "poll": [], "name": "Trenches", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Card Drafting"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "average": "1", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Golden Egg Games"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "World War I"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Trenches is a fast-paced card game for two players, set in the trenches of late WWI.<br/><br/>The players will fight off for the best of 3 conflicts in order to win the campaign.

Versions of the game were released for the Family Computer (1987) and MSX (1988). While Acclaim Entertainment advertised a Western regions release for the NES, console versions remained exclusive to Japan. Seibu Kaihatsu eventually released a follow-up game, Dead Angle.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The game is set in 1931 New York City where the player controls a young man who seeks to avenge family members who were killed in a gang shootout. Over a period of several months, the player targets a series of mobsters, culminating with the mafia boss.<br/><br/>The player moves a crosshair around the screen, which pans to cover a larger panorama, to aim and shoot at mobsters, one shot at a time. The mobsters lurk around various areas, including on the street and in windows. An arrow appears that helps direct players to the location of the next mobster onscreen.<br/><br/>Players have a limited amount of time to find and shoot each enemy. If time is running out, a speech bubble appears counting down the last few seconds. When the countdown reaches zero, the player is shot and the screen pans to reveal the location of the enemy. A Shield button is available as a last resort to avoid being shot if a player cannot target an enemy before the countdown reaches zero. Pressing the Shield button skews the crosshairs away from the enemy while the protective shield is up.<br/><br/>Levels are cleared after a set number of mobsters are eliminated. In the game's final level, the player has only one opportunity to assassinate the mob boss as he walks in front of windows in a building. After the final level is completed, the game loops back to the beginning.<br/><br/>The Famicom port is largely the same as the arcade version. One notable difference is that the player's progress can be restored any time in the Famicom version by using a password system of four numbers and/or letters.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Empire City: 1931&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "138712": {"poll": [], "name": "Max RPM", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Arcade edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1579930.png", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Bally/Midway"], "videogamegenre": ["Racing", "Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Bally/Midway"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1579930_t.png", "description": "Advertising Flyer<br/><br/>Max excitement...Max earnings...Max RPM.

Earthbound observers detected a huge armada of exotic, bionic spaceships, the Xenoids, headed towards our home planet. You are a veteran pilot piloting a heavily armed prototype fighter spacecraft, the &quot;Exterminator&quot;. Equipped with state of the art laser and shielding technology, your piloting skills and the &quot;Exterminator&quot; are the only way to stop the armada of invaders and save humankind from certain damnation. Will you be able to stop the Xenoid intruders?<br/><br/>This card game for one player tries to emulate the gameplay of classic arcade-style top-down space shooters. You control a spaceship that starts with 3 Lives, 3 Shields and a Weapon with Power 1. You are facing an armada of enemy (Xenoid) Spacecraft which move downwards towards you while you try to destroy as many of them as possible by performing one out of 3 actions each turn: Move - Shoot - Charge (your Weapon).<br/><br/>The Game features 5 Waves (Levels) with enemies becoming stronger and more numerous as you advance through the stages. <br/>You collect Power Ups (such as Weapon or Shield Upgrades or additional Lives etc) which pop up at random when enemy crafts are destroyed. In between stages you can buy Power Ups by spending points you acccumulated during the Waves. Each destroyed enemy goes to the Score Pile and may be used to pay for Power Ups in between Waves.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is twofold: The primary goal is to survive all five Waves. When all your shields are depleted you lose one life, and when all lives are lost it means &quot;Game Over&quot;. The secondary goal is to strive for the highest possible score by destroying as many Xenoid ships as possible. Again you score points for every destroyed enemy spaceship. So in your first game you will set your initial high score which you can beat in consecutive games. Note that you even set a score if you don't beat the game...<br/><br/>"}, "138725": {"poll": [], "name": "Buffalo Bill", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2542070_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bayerwald Spiele"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2542070.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["American West", "Children's Game", "Dice"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Objective: be the first catching all enemies or capture their headquarter<br/>- moving by turns -<br/>2 players (or groups) - red Indians &amp; (blue) cowboys) try to catch each other by rolling the die; <br/>remarks:<br/>published during late 1950's/early 60's <br/>similar to - compared with Tom Mix in Texas<br/><br/>"}, "138726": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Sam Ritchie"], "poll": [], "name": "Math Dice Powers Practice Edition", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Math Dice"], "maxplayers": "3", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2047429_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["ThinkFun"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2047429.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Math", "Number"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "In this game layers roll the two 12-sided target <br/>dice and calculate the target number by using the blue die as the base and the red die as the exponent.

Players compete head-to-head to destroy each other's fleets and space station; the last player or team standing is the victor.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Players choose from a variety of pre-constructed decks or can assemble their own, then each player takes turns either building up their base or building ships to attack their opponents. First player to destroy (or take over from boarding action) is the winner.<br/><br/>Each faction/deck has a unique power and varied amounts of resources generated each turn. With these resources you can add on modules to your base, or play ships/marines to the table. Your base functions as a mothership where your subsequent ships make up the fleet you will use for offense and defense. Each turn you will get more resources based on your base and the modules attached (which can add to your resource generation).<br/><br/>The ships and marines have different special abilities such as stealth (to avoid enemy detection). Some ships can even retrieve more ships from your deck at no cost.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.<br/><br/>Second Edition Updated Rules<br/><br/>Stackable Traits are no more! <br/>To reduce the amount of math that HB Commanders have to do in combat, traits that granted a +X ability are being retooled. Values are now only the printed numbers, and do not increase with any +X effects.<br/><br/>Trait-or-Fire!<br/>Use your weapons or a trait. That's one of the simplest rules in Hull Breach! It also now applies to stations as well &ndash; no more Target Painting for 4 and shooting 6 at the same target with your station. Stations should have advantages but testing reveals that certain station builds were becoming pwnmobiles, capable of ripping apart attacking fleets.<br/><br/>Spicing Up Events!<br/>The tried-and-true Event cards now have two possible outcomes: a Critical outcome and a Nominal outcome. When you deploy the card, you make a D10 die roll to determine what you'll get. A roll of a 1 or a 10 is a Critical outcome, and is in some cases a more powerful result, and sometimes a bad result for the person wielding the card. Any other roll result is a Nominal outcome, which results in the 'usual' outcome for that card.<br/><br/>Faction-Only Cards!<br/>Some cards, specifically some Marines, Upgrades and Events, are now marked as Faction-Only, meaning that only the faction printed on the card gets to use them. This has been done in an attempt to work a little more story flavor into the game. For example, Special Operations Groups represent the RDF Marine Corps' elite troops and are no longer available to non-RDF players. As compensation, Corporate Commanders can now field their own elite Marines known as Direct Assault Response Teams (DART).<br/><br/>Module Overhaul!<br/>There have been significant changes in the world of Modules. In HB Alpha, Modules were further divided into Module-Ship, Module-Station, and Module-Marine cards. No longer! They've been broken into more obviously different types depending on what they attach to, and we've made a more clearer distinction of size on ships, Stations, and Modules. One of the new things we can do is attach multiple mods to ships, and Stations are a little more narrowly restricted to what they can or can't attach, depending on what the purpose of the station is (military versus economy).<br/><br/>Say Goodbye to Characters!<br/>Character cards were a neat idea. Unfortunately they proved to be too frequently used as the basis for an entire deck strategy. So, they're all dead. Most, however, have been reborn as Add Personnel cards that can be attached to Marines and do something cool for your local units. The tradeoff is that they're no longer independent units that can board ships or stations and fire back at you, and they're nowhere near as powerful as they once were.<br/><br/>First-Turn Facefisting is Ancient History!<br/>We have implemented a couple of new mechanics at game start that will alleviate most first-turn knockouts. We've achieved this by revising the initiative rules for the starting phase of the game: the Commander with the smallest fleet and Station size (printed on the card, and mentioned above), begins play after the Setup Phase. So, if you deploy fewer or smaller ships than your adversary, you take the first in-sequence turn of the game rather than leave it to a die roll for initiative.<br/><br/>New Combat Mechanics!<br/><br/>Initiative in Engagements<br/>Now controlled by unit size and progresses from the smallest ships up to the largest. The heavies are much slower and more cumbersome than your Fighters and Frigates, so they take longer to get into firing position.<br/><br/>Attacker and Defender<br/>Volley fire at each other in turn, in order of smallest to largest, with the exception of the defending Station getting first shot. So: Defender station, then attacker's fighters, defender's fighters, attacker's Frigates, etc, all the way up to Capital Ships.<br/><br/>New Skirmish Phase<br/>The Interceptor Phase has been replaced by Skirmish. Any ships with the trait Interceptor (defending) or Raider (attacking) get to jump to the head of the attack order line, for the first turn only. No more extra turns for defenders!<br/><br/>Boarding Actions<br/>Just like volley fire, boarding actions (now part of the Maneuver Phase) adhere to initiative rules: smaller ships act first, reflecting the idea that faster and more maneuverable craft have the advantage in landing Marines on-target. Boards are not declared until the start of the Maneuver Phase, and once they're all declared, Escort effects are applied and then they're resolved in ascending size order. You can now only declare a board on a ship of equal class size or larger.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.<br/><br/>"}, "138730": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1578125.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Daniel Auxier"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Tim Greenan", "James Hill", "Irvin Jackson"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)", "NSB Games, Inc."], "boardgameintegration": ["Hull Breach: Corporate Wars", "Hull Breach: Loyalty and Vigilance", "Hull Breach: Corporate Wars", "Hull Breach: Loyalty and Vigilance"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1578125_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Dice", "Economic", "Industry / Manufacturing", "Political", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "description": "The Basics:<br/><br/>Hull Breach is an award-winning Card Game from Not-So-Broken (NSB) Games.

Now, we are moving to complete the set with In Defiance of Dictators.<br/><br/>This space-based Card and Dice tabletop game which features epic combat between warships, firefights during Marine boarding actions, and a multitude of clever tactics and galaxy-shaking events, Hull Breach is one of the fastest-growing platforms in the gaming world.<br/><br/>In Hull Breach, you assume command of an advanced space station belonging to one of our several in-game factions and fight it out with one or more other Commanders to achieve galactic domination.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to protect your Station - your home in space - from other Commanders while trying to capture or destroy theirs. Be warned - they&rsquo;re trying to do the same thing to you. It's a tough galaxy and at the end of the day only one Commander will remain standing. Only through careful planning can the most daring gain command of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Each deck of Hull Breach cards consists of fifty-five (55) cards, including a Station, two Station Module enhancements, two Stockpile cards to track your resources and economic wealth, with fifty others to help extend your power across the galaxy. Each pre-constructed deck sports an effective array of the different card types you&rsquo;ll need to wage war against your opponents: Upgrades, Options, Modules, Marines, Ships, Events, Tactics, and Breakthroughs. Once you have a few games under your belt you can mix and match cards from different decks to create your very own personalized fighting force and compete against some of the finest commanders in the galaxy.<br/><br/>Best of all, while we encourage customization and deck-building, this isn't one of those &quot;collectible&quot; card games that will have you tearing through randomized foil packs of cards to find the ones you want. Hull Breach plays right out of the box and you'll know where you can find every card in the game without having to drop a ton of cash on additional boosters or turn to the secondary market to field a competitive deck.<br/><br/>Also, Hull Breach is not only a game, but a developing universe where the players have the opportunity to affect the outcome of the fighting between the factions. In every box you receive a fiction supplement to help you immerse yourself in the Universe&rsquo;s rich backstory, and we are currently in negotiations to expand upon that literary presence. In fact, several of the Reward levels below will allow you to create your own historical presence in the Hull Breach universe.<br/><br/>I'm a returning Commander (player); so what can you tell us about the new Hull Breach Expansion: In Defiance of Dictators?<br/><br/>Hull Breach!: &quot;In Defiance of Dictators&quot; focuses on the rising conflict between the Republic Defense Force and the Colonial Unaligned Forces in the wake of the Corporate Wars. Once again, you take control of one of the faction-controlled stations, build up your fleet and forces, and do battle with any who would attempt to encroach upon your space. Each box set includes four (4) pre-constructed decks (ready to play directly out of the box) complete with all new stations and cards that pit 2 RDF Commanders against 2 Colonial Commanders. Are you ready to fight off the imperialistic monsters, or crush the rebel scum? You decide, you command!<br/><br/>You asked and we listened! Over the course of the last two expansions, we have consistently continued to listen to our players and fan base, in order to continue to expand and improved our Hull Breach Universe.

The game comes with some creative ideas for this. Then everybody rolls one dice and moves along the trail accordingly. The trail is filled with short cuts filled with Jail spots. When a player lands in Jail, they must finish their drink before returning to gameplay. On the main yellow trail, players are likely to land on the Golden Acorns. Landing here means the player gets bonus turns by guessing high, low, odd, or even, based on their previous roll, and they keep going untill they guess wrong. Simply follow the yellow trail and everybody will make it to the finish, but the twisted trail makes this an interesting tricky challenge. Luckily the game comes with a map that will show you the way. The game also comes with sober cab rules so everybody can play. If you are a power hour fan, you will definately like the drinking challenge built into this game. The challenge is that every time you land on a &quot;D&quot; Spot, you must take the number of drinks that you rolled to get there.

The player whose board contains the same picture calls out, gets the tile and places it on his/her board. The first player to have covered all the images on his/her board wins the game.<br/><br/>2. Picture quiz<br/>The game master shows a picture without naming it. The player who has the picture on his/her board calls out, but they only get the tile if they can name the object. The opposite way is possible too: The game master doesn't show the picture but names the object shown on the tile. The player who finds the picture on his/her board gets the tile. The first player to have covered all the images on his/her board wins the game.<br/><br/>3. Memory lotto<br/>Each player gets a board. He/she gets 30 seconds to memorise the images. Then the player boards are placed on the table, face down. The game master picks up one tile after the other and shows the image or names the object. The player who thinks the image is on his/her own player board calls out. The tile is placed face up next to the player board. If two players call out simultaneously, the game master puts the tile at the bottom of his/her stack. If an image isn't claimed by any of the players, the tile is removed from the game. When the game master has used all the tiles, the players reveal their boards. For each matching tile, they get two points; for each incorrect or missing one, one point is subtracted.

You have to avoid a particularly nasty storm, or at least that is what your scout and mountain man has told you. Now you try in a vain and futile way to take this load of furs and group of settlers through these mountain woods. The goal: to reach Fort Astoria where the Pacific Fur Company's ship Tonquin is waiting for you, payment on delivery. That's when the storm turns north and you start to pray. The snow traps you there in dense woods of evergreens with only the howls of the coyote to pierce the harrowing sound of the wind. After the first day, you find the smoldering remains of one of your folk, only no one is missing.<br/><br/>Under flickering lantern light the doctor asks his strange companion, the native turned white man, why he has tears in his eyes. His answer frightens you all: &quot;One of us is the Coyote Spirit. One of us is a murdering trickster god, trying to do anything to return to the world in human form. We can't let it.&quot; It&rsquo;s the impossible words of a mad man, or so you all thought that second day. However, now it&rsquo;s the fifth day and stranger things keep happening. Surely this is your last chance to escape this madness and return to the world of the sane, if only the snow wasn't so deep and your feet weren't so cold...<br/><br/>"}, "138838": {"poll": [], "name": "Jeopardy!

The concept of karma &ndash; good and bad, owing or being owed a debt, and both being a responsibility &ndash; and a meta game element of card destruction (making every deck unique) and Real World &trade; consequences (in the form of a verbal contract to play) sort of came after the pun of Karma and Armageddon.<br/><br/>The most important part of this game concept is that players may &ldquo;help&rdquo; you, even when you don&rsquo;t want it, and that this will exact a real consequence to clear the debt. Of course, like a gambling debt, this isn&rsquo;t enforceable. However, entering into the spirit of the thing is the whole point. Why cheat? You&rsquo;re only robbing yourself&hellip;<br/><br/>Set up<br/>There are two elements to this game:<br/><br/>1) A card game played with (what starts out at least as) a standard deck of cards. If there are Jokers, bridge rules or instruction cards, include them.<br/><br/>2) Redemption of Debt where cards used to help other players are IOUs for an hour of a player&rsquo;s time on any reasonable, legal and responsible task.<br/><br/>To play (the first time) a Sharpie or permanent marker and a standard deck of cards (with jokers) is necessary for 2-4 players. For more than 4 players an extra deck of cards is added for each additional player up to 8 maximum; ideally this should have a different back design or be different size to allow separation for future 2-4 player games. These cards will be torn, ripped and marked, so will likely not be useful for other games afterwards.<br/><br/>NOTE: a deck where cards are missing (otherwise useless!) is fine as a starting deck. Subsequent play will likely not have all the cards anyway, so one or two missing now won&rsquo;t matter. Reuse/Recycling!!! I feel better already!<br/><br/>Set up for the Meta-Game (the redemption of favours) is merely the agreement of all players that they will commit to an hour of time helping one another for each &ldquo;Debt Card&rdquo; they end up with. Where this occurs in game, the card will be ripped in two and both parts signed by helper and helpee; its recommended that a phone number or email address for each is also written down, unless players are well acquainted. The helpee then uses their half in play (for that game only) and later as a reminder that they owe a favour. The helper keeps their half to call in the debt.<br/><br/>NOTE: The hour of time and the task are to be mutually agreed between helper and helpee. It could be anything crom mowing a lawn, babysitting, fixing a computer, whatever is acceptable and doable.<br/><br/>NOTE 2: Debts do NOT cancel out. If Mike owes Paco a debt and vice versa, they don&rsquo;t call it quits. They both do an hour for the other. This is a matter of honour!<br/><br/>Once a debt is paid, &ldquo;Done&rdquo; is written on the helpers half and &ldquo;Paid&rdquo; is written on the helpees half. Cards can be kept as a memento, burned ceremoniously or binned.<br/><br/>"}, "138840": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph J.

In this case, they must spend at least some of their time below the surface of the open sea. This creates extreme stress upon the characters as it requires them to have a means of breathing underwater, as well as dealing with the penalties that occur when combating creatures that dwell in such a place. It is recommended that you provide the characters access to minor magic (i.e., potions of water breathing)that will aide them in their exploration. (An NPC within the village will have at least 6 such items when the characters arrive)<br/>     Because of the condition just described, it is more favorable for the players to have access to character classes that are beyond the basic core group(cleric, fighter, magic user, thief). By allowing druids and monks, for example, the party might possess skills outside the basic classes that could enhance their chances of success. If you do not wish to allow such classes, then it would be prudent to provide nominal magic items that might help the group in ways that, those mentioned, might have.<br/>     The beginning of this scenario takes place on land, along the shore of some continent-realm where coastal villages are common.

Based in the mythical World of Torn, it presents the lore, races, people, heroes, and history to players through the use of game-play scenarios. The core set focuses on the conflicts between two factions:<br/><br/>The Sisk Empire: an expansionist society, believing that their advanced culture and religious ideology are something from which everyone can benefit. Unfortunately their war-machine is thinly stretched, over-taxed, and on the brink of collapse. They seek wealth, raw materials, technology and slaves.<br/><br/>The Maychians: anthropomorphic creatures that live in the so-called &quot;New Continents&quot; in the northern hemisphere. Their land is an undiscovered country, full of untapped resources and ancient ruins. The Maychians possess primitive technology, but are fervent in their desire to defend their homeland and resist the Sisk invasion.<br/><br/>Included in the core set are 39 highly-detailed miniatures, 12 unit stat cards, a full color rule book, full color scenario book, 4 double-sided color battle posters, 8 Magical Item cards, 8 Spell cards and 25 dice of 5 different colors.<br/><br/>The battle for Torn World begins as the Sisk explorers land on the beaches of the &quot;New Continents&quot; with the intent to discover and claim ancient magical relics from a forgotten age.

In fact, the game was released in 2012 as part of Disney's promotion of &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, a film which ostensibly takes place inside this arcade game and others.<br/><br/>Fix-It Felix, Jr. most closely resembles the classic Donkey Kong (released in 1981) with a small protagonist making his way up a building in pursuit of a much larger character. However the gameplay is very different.<br/><br/>Set on the outside of a large residential building in &quot;Niceland&quot;, the game starts with Wreck-It Ralph climbing the building and pounding it with his fists such that many of the windows break. The distressed residents cry &quot;Fix It Felix!&quot;. At this point the user gains control of the eponymous Felix. Felix can move in four directions, jumping from window-ledge to window-ledge. Using his magic hammer he can repair a pane of glass. In the arcade and browser versions, three stories of the building are in play at any one time. When Felix has repaired each of the windows of those three stories, the game moves up to the next three stories and the game repeats. After completing a number of screens (two in the arcade version, three or more depending on level in the browser / mobile versions) Felix and Ralph reach the top of the building. The residents pick up Ralph and throw him off the roof. The game starts again at the bottom of a new building.<br/><br/>Felix's job is made more difficult by Ralph continuing to pound the building, causing bricks to fall which must be avoided. Birds fly across the building which must also be avoided. In later levels drainpipes, etc. block Felix's path between different windowledges, forcing him to find alternative routes. Felix can pick up pies provided by the building residents which grants him temporary invulnerability and in some versions allows his hammer to fix entire windows at once rather than one pane at a time.<br/><br/>Fix-It Felix was available as a browser game on the Disney website and as an app on a number of platforms - either standalone, or as part of a compilation with three other games also featured in the Wreck-It Ralph film. It was also released as a full-size arcade cabinet to promote the film.<br/><br/>"}, "138982": {"poll": [], "name": "Hero's Duty", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1588061.png", "videogametheme": ["Aliens", "Movie, Book, TV show"], "videogamefranchise": ["Wreck-It Ralph"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Sarbakan"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Disney Interactive Studios, Inc."], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1588061_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Hero's Duty is a 3D on-rails shooter released in 2012 as part of Disney's promotion of &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, a film which ostensibly takes place inside this arcade game and others.<br/><br/>The player controls a cursor onscreen using the mouse.
