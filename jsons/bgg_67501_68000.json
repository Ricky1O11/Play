The game uses a rule which reminds of Progressive Chess.<br/><br/>The game was implemented for online play at games.wtanaka.com on January 28, 2010.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Progressive Mancala is played on a one-rank mancala board which numbers eleven holes. Initially there are five stones in each hole. There is also a common goal which is adjacent to the central hole of the board. Both players sit on the same side of the board in front of it. One player is called West, the other East.<br/><br/>East starts to the game and plays from right to left. West sows from left to right.<br/><br/>On each turn a player empties a hole and then distributes its contents into the following holes, one by one, in his direction. If he reaches the end of the board, he continues to distribute the stones by first dropping a stone into the Goal, then into the holes starting from the opposite end of the board. That is, he circles around the board.<br/><br/>If the last stone is dropped into a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last distributed stone) are picked up and then distributed as usual in multi-lap games.<br/><br/>The move ends if the last stone is dropped into an empty hole or the goal.<br/><br/>For each move that a player has terminated in an empty hole, his enemy must make a bonus move (bonus moves are compulsory).<br/><br/>If the last stone is dropped into the goal, the player captures its contents including the last distributed stone. The captured stones are stored. Dropping the last stone into the goal never results in a bonus move for the opponent.<br/><br/>The player who captured most stones is declared the winner. Draws are impossible because the sum of all stones is odd.<br/><br/>Expert Variant<br/><br/>Good players may take a board which has 17 holes. Again, there are five stones in each hole at the start of the game.<br/><br/>"}, "67588": {"rpgartist": ["Bill Arndt", "Doc Chaos", "Matthew Steinen"], "rpgitemversion": ["First printing"], "poll": [], "name": "New Rules, Races & Classes", "rpgdesigner": ["Erik Aronesty", "Ben Aronesty", "Andrew Kalan"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic676465.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": ["Lore of the Crypt Reviews"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Underworld Publishing"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Lore of the Crypt"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic676465_t.jpg", "description": "From the cover:<br/><br/>Introducing the demon spawned Cambion, a spell point system, and much, much more!<br/><br/>"}, "67589": {"rpgartist": ["Janet Aulisio", "Steve Bryant", "Amy Doubet", "Rick Harris", "Robert Lazzaretti", "Darrell Midgette", "Ellisa Mitchell", "Keith Parkinson", "Kirk Wescom"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "poll": [], "name": "Necropolis", "rpgdesigner": ["Gary Gygax"], "rpgproducer": ["Steve Maggi", "Lester Smith"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic676471.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["\u00c6rth"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Dangerous Journeys"], "rpgpublisher": ["GDW Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic676471_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>The Necropolis campaign scenario is an epic adventure which sweeps the Heroic Personas across the dramatic landscapes of &AElig;rth's most magickal kingdom, &AElig;gypt.<br/><br/>"}, "67590": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic676721.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Chas Argent", "Gary Boyce", "Ken Dunn", "Brian Youse"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Nicol\u00e1s Eskubi", "Charles Kibler"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Multi-Man Publishing"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic676721_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "(from user's description:)<br/><br/>A limited print run of 1000 copies to benefit the ALS Association in the fight against ALS (more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease)<br/><br/>Consists of ASL map board 59 and two scenarios, Failure to Communicate and French Toast and Bacon.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "7.80682", "name": "WO Bonus Pack #1: ASL Scenario Bonus Pack for Winter Offensive 2010", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Advanced Squad Leader"], "usersrated": "44", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Advanced Squad Leader"]}, "67591": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tommy De Coninck"], "average": "6.75", "poll": [], "name": "Powerhouse", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic728085_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Tommy De Coninck"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic728085.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Mafia", "Print & Play", "Territory Building"], "age": "7", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In Powerhouse each player is the head of a crime syndicate that's yearning to take control of The City.

Soon the fortress would be put to the test as an assault detachment from the 220th Guards Rifle Regiment reached the intersection. Finding the building defended with artillery and machine guns 1st Lieutenant Vasili Chernyayev ordered the two 45mm antitank guns supporting his force to fire at the upper level windows to suppress the machine guns while his guardsmen stormed the building. Storm troops, leading the attack with hand grenades, broke into the main level of the house and killed a German crew manning a small artillery piece. Another detachment, with the help of direct mortar fire, captured a nearby building that was supporting the main position. As vicious hand-to-hand fighting broke out in the fortress the Germans launched several counter-attacks supported by tanks and self propelled guns.

The tale tells the king, feeling his imminent death, summoned to his court a powerful necromancer. With the aid of the dreaded wizard he built a magical tomb and, during a stormy night, personally slaughtered his wife, his son and his whole court. Then the necromancer entombed the King with all his treasure and family, protecting them with dreadful necromantic magic and eventually transformed himself in a powerful archlich.

You can event print more than one copy of the same map in order to obtain a bigger map.<br/><br/>Dwellings<br/>On this plateau you can find the most basic gnoll settlement: dozen of gigantic huts made of hides and bones, mostly used for sleeping and to take shelter during the night or during the frequent sandstorms. A single well provides enough fresh water for the gnolls living there. Standard features of every gnoll settlement are the hyena fences, scattered among the huts. Several dump pits have been excavated there and there.<br/>The cabal of shamans erected a couple of totems and designated two spots as sacred ground for spirit calling.<br/><br/>Temple of the Hyena God<br/>A gigantic dome flanked by two smaller ones rises on this plateau. A single, giant statue of a mighty demonic gnoll overlooks a blood-spattered sacrificial altar. Bones of gigantic sand monsters form the ceiling of this impressive structure. A smaller dome is dedicated to minor gnoll deities. A single high priest surveys this structure at all times<br/><br/>Slave Pen<br/>This is where the gnolls keep their slaves. Mostly they maraud the desert caravans and then use the slaves for sacrifices or sell them to unscrupulous human bandits. The slave pen is built around a massive dragon skeleton dead from ages. The gnolls mount constant guard over the slave pen, looking through peeping holes made in the four corner huts. Hyenas also help the gnoll guards to survey the complex.<br/><br/>Packmaster&rsquo;s Palace<br/>This massive structure is almost big as the temple. It houses the mighty gnoll packmaster along with his bodyguards and concubines. The packmaster hides a great treasure looted in many years of activity over the desert. The packmaster&rsquo;s bedroom is full of looted furniture and treasure. A smaller building houses the elite troop as well as a packmaster&rsquo;s personal larder full of fine spirits.<br/><br/>"}, "67619": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mario Barbati"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Woodland Glades", "rpgartist": ["Mario Barbati", "O'Bully"], "rpgproducer": ["Anna Fava"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["\u00d8one Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["\u00d8one's Colorprints"], "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Four gorgeous maps for you to enhance your wilderness encounters.

By dice-less, I mean that the game involves no randomizers. By cooperative, I mean that authority over the game is decentralized. Every player will share some of the responsibilities of a traditional GM, including framing scenes and playing multiple roles.<br/><br/>Playing Dark Spell is hard to play if everyone isn't on the same page. Everybody has a lot of authority to change and introduce new elements into the game setting. Everybody is assumed to be at the game to have fun, build an interesting story, and challenge one another. The players may frequently be sporting and competitive, and the characters under their control will often be in direct opposition, but everyone's at the game table for he same overarching purpose.<br/><br/>Differences in vision and other issues are bound to come up now and again. At the first opportune moment (say, between scenes, or during a pause in the action) take a brief pause in the game to deal with them out of game. Everyone doesn't have to want the game to go in the same direction, but everyone must respect the vision of the other players. Make compromises.<br/><br/>The inspiration behind Dark Spell is the excellent story hour on ENWorld, &quot;The Tales of Wyre,&quot; by the poster SepulchraveII. A game of Dark Spell should feature powerful characters conflicting over big issues. There should be might, magic, and drama. The main characters should have strong goals and strong convictions, and change the world as they pursue their course. Read the ENWorld thread if you need a bit of inspiration.<br/><br/>Dark Spell is not an immersive game. Players will be frequently called upon to operate at the meta-game level, and will need to portray multiple separate characters. Even though there may be many things that an individual does not know, there are no secrets between players in a game of Dark Spell. Don't hide things from the other players. Try to keep your out-of-game knowledge separate from the in-game knowledge of each of your characters. Don't be afraid to state actions for characters that land them in trouble. Trouble creates tension, excitement, and drama. These are good things. Want these things. Want trouble.<br/><br/>Read. Enjoy.<br/><br/>Go Play!<br/><br/>"}, "67646": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mario Barbati"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "The Dungeon Under the Mountain: Level 3", "rpgartist": ["Mario Barbati", "O'Bully"], "rpgproducer": ["Anna Fava"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic677275.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["\u00d8one Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["The Dungeon Under the Mountain"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic677275_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>The Dungeon Under the Mountain, Level 3<br/>A great underground river crosses this level.

He claims the half-orc has fallen in with a gang of bandits that live in the ruins in the foothills to the north and is using the devices to ensnare travelers coming down the trade-road. He is afraid authorities will eventually recognize his craftsmanship and tying him to the crimes. The truth is that the traps bear the secret mark of the local thieves&rsquo; guild, and should the authorities find them in his ex-ward&rsquo;s possession, they could be used to incriminate him as a high-ranking guild member.<br/>     The once disorganized and barbaric orcs of Last Hope have recently banded together under the leadership and organization of a half-orc named Pugt. The orcs believe he is a messiah, and he himself does little to assuage such statements. He has brought them great success with his clever tactics and use of guerilla warfare and traps. His forces are slowly but surely sweeping across the wilds and drawing ever nearer the borders of the civilized lands. Adventurers are summoned to stop the advance by making a covert strike against Pugt, circling the troops and coming up from behind to catch him in his tower.<br/>     The tower rests at the edge of some wind-stripped hills near an older trade route. The 50-feet square massive towers stand three stories-tall and were once used as military guard posts and way stations during the last war.

You will be eating these, so you may substitute something else that tastes a little off.

If something like this ever comes up, as Gamemaster, you simply make up a number of dice to roll (don't forget to include the Master Die). Roll half the Player's dice for an easy task, equal the Player's dice for a moderately difficult job, and one-and-a-half times the Player's dice for something super tough.<br/><br/>This game can be played with or without a Gamemaster.

The first is by getting five of your tokens in a row consecutively. Second way is by capturing ten of your opponent's tokens.<br/><br/>RULES FOR PLAY<br/>One player selects all the tokens of one color. The second player takes all the tokens of the other color. Players choose for first play. The starting player places a token on one of the four circles reading, START. Tokens are not moved from spaces once they are placed on board. Play then alternates between players who then place tokens anywhere on the board. (However, to work out successful patterns of play, do not place your tokens too wide apart. By concentrating your tokens in definite areas, you will be better able to fulfill the objective of the game&ndash;5 tokens in a row.) Your 5 tokens must be placed consecutively in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row. If you succeed in accomplishing this, you are declared the winner. The other method of winning is to capture ten of your opponent's men. A capture is performed by surrounding two of your opponent's tokens by placing two of your tokens one on each side of his. If a player places his tokens in a position so as to become out-flanked, he loses the out-flanked pair of tokens to his opponent. When a capture is completed, the captured tokens are removed from the playing field and placed in the &quot;CAPTURED OPPONENTS&quot; area of board. In this way, both you and your opponent can readily see how the game is progressing. Five pairs (10) of captured opponents constitute a win. Included in the set are more tokens than are necessary to complete the game. However, it is possible that a game could be played out without anyone winning. In this case, the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>Chek-ro is similar to ninuki-renju and Pente<br/><br/>"}, "67771": {"rpgartist": ["Chris Baker", "Mary Common", "Emmanuel", "Alan Hunter", "Angus McKie", "Russ Nicholson", "Jim Pitts"], "statistics": [], "name": "White Dwarf (Issue 20 - Aug 1980)", "rpgdesigner": ["Tony Chamberlain", "Andy Davidson", "Ian Livingstone", "Phil Masters", "Bob McWilliams", "Roger Musson", "John Olsen", "Colin Reynolds", "Andy Slack", "William Stephenson"], "rpgproducer": ["Albie Fiore", "Steve Jackson (II)", "Ian Livingstone", "Robert Owens", "Andy Slack"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic678812.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "rpgissue": ["White Dwarf"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Character Conjuring: The Alchemist", "Conversion", "Dungeons and ...

As a lord of Scotland with land, men and money at your disposal, now is the time to lay your claim. But you are not alone. Your rivals have been waiting for just such an opportunity themselves and they are poised to act. With the clans of Scotland ready to follow the strongest leader, it is up to you to win the loyalty of the clans first. If you can demonstrate your prowess in battle to enough clans, then the rest will fall in line behind you. Do you have the audacity and cunning it takes to be crowned king?<br/><br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>You acquire the support you need to win the game by winning skirmishes against your rivals. A skirmish is five consecutive rounds of play. During each round of a skirmish, you have the opportunity to either build up your army by playing cards from your hand or recruit clans to fight for you by drawing cards from the recruit pile. At the end of the five rounds, each lord gets to claim a supporter in order of highest strength army to lowest. Then you discard all the clans you mustered and begin a new skirmish.  The game ends when one lord reaches forty or more points worth of supporters and claims the throne. If you hope to be the one to do so, you will need to know when to commit your forces to battle and when to regroup to fight another day.<br/><br/><br/>Design Notes<br/><br/>Lords of Scotland borrows design elements of Three-Dragon Ante, Condottiere and Havoc: The Hundred Years War and sets the action in the interregnum period of Scottish history surrounding the wars for Scottish Independence.  The gameplay is broken up into five-round skirmishes which are conducted in a turn based clockwise fashion.  During each skirmish, the ability to activate more special card powers by going first is balanced by the knowledge of what strength card you need to play to win by going last.  Throughout the game there is a general pressure to use resources to make immediate attacks of opportunity, balanced against the need to collect resources for long-term strategic advantage.  Lords of Scotland scales well to the number of players with most victories being determined in the final skirmish.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian first edition", "English first edition", "English second edition", "French first edition", "Japanese first edition"], "average": "6.79296", "name": "Lords of Scotland", "playingtime": "35", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "1218", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Scotland"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 9: All Change"]}, "67889": {"rpgdesigner": ["Justin Alexander"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "rpgseries": ["Instant Adventures", "Legends & Lairs"], "name": "Lost Hunt", "rpgartist": ["Louis Frank", "Ben Prenevost", "Scott Schomburg", "Brian Schomburg"], "rpgproducer": ["Greg Benage"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic680352.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "rpgissuearticle": ["Head-to-Head: Mini Adventures"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fantasy Flight Games"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic680352_t.jpg", "description": "From the back cover:<br/><br/>An instant adventure for 4-6 characters levels 8-10.<br/><br/>The elves of the village welcomed you with open arms, and have demonstrated a kindness and generosity that you have sometimes come to doubt still existed in the world.

And, until now, no one has ever tried to make a game to capture the struggle.<br/><br/>Late December, 1944, while the Allies began to pinch off The Bulge, the Soviets&mdash;and their new-found Romanian allies&mdash;began the assault on the &quot;twin cities&quot; of Buda and Pest, where 79,000 surrounded Axis defenders held on against heavy odds, made more difficult by &quot;high command&quot; orders to defend everywhere and not to consider a breakout effort. With German mobile reserves and stockpiled supplies expended by the Wacht am Rhein, a mixed force of Germans and Hungarians held on with little hope of relief. By mid February, after the city fell, less than 1000 Axis troops of all kinds made it back to the dwindling safety of German lines.<br/><br/>Hungarian Nightmare puts you in the difficult command situations for both sides. The Soviets have two full &quot;fronts&quot; worth of troops, plus a corps of their newly gained (and doubtful quality) Romanian troops, while the Axis player commands a hodge-podge of various unit types of widely ranging enthusiasm. German units include remnants of two SS cavalry divisions, panzer kampfgroups, rear-area units, and strays, while Hungarian units are even more diverse, with everything from assault gun companies to police units and WWI veterans, with some troops ready to hold on to the bitter end and others looking for an early opportunity of melting away. The Axis player struggles with dwindling fuel, supplies, and manpower energy, while the Soviet player competes with a difficult time-table and the loss of key units to repel relief efforts. In game terms, the actual historical result would be a &quot;draw,&quot; thus each player has the opportunity and the challenge to &quot;do better.&quot;<br/><br/>Designed by Mark Stille (North Wind Rain, Imperial Sunset, Wintergewitter), Hungarian Nightmare offers 280 counters, an area-movement map of the cities, with each space about one square kilometer, and three-day turns that cover the entire, brutal campaign.<br/><br/>For the first time in gaming, the assault on Budapest is yours to make or to fend off.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "6.86333", "name": "Hungarian Nightmare", "playingtime": "300", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "30", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Hungary", "Magazine: Against The Odds"]}, "67892": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Name That Word!

A roll of 00 is read as one-hundred.<br/><br/>Supreme Being<br/><br/>Where most other games have one gamemaster, SLURPS gives each Player a chance to be Supreme Being. Every Player takes a turn at being Supreme Being at least once. When you are Supreme Being you create the locations, situations and any non-Supplicant characters, as well as control your Supplicant.

Shaped in mockery of the Great Tree, Aufstrag lorded over the kingdoms of man, elf and dwarf and its master, Unklar, ruled with his iron mace. But time swept him away and into the Void, and upon the ruins of his dark memory new kingdoms have risen, a new world born. An age of heroes is begun, where adventuring crusaders ride forth into the wilderness to reclaim it through the iron in their veins, and the magic they too control.<br/><br/>But memories run deep and the stain of Unklar&rsquo;s reign is not so easily rooted out. His minions haunt the dark places of the world. They occupy forgotten temples, ruined dungeons, castles on the borderlands; from these bastions they plot the return of their horned master, or at the very least, the terror of men. Here evil resides, and thrives; treasures abound, hidden magic lies unused and forgotten.<br/><br/>There is perhaps no greater bastion for the refugees of Aufstrag than the lands south of that fated tower. The Blacktooth Ridge dominates the country, jutting out from the southern foothills like a finger pointing to Aufstrag. Beneath it flows the slow moving, dark Hruesan River and beyond those banks are the Lands of the Barren Wood and west of it all the Blighted Screed. These lands rest upon the Northern Marches of the Kingdom of New Aenochia, and the few towns that are here, Botkinburg and Ludensheim, lie on the very edge of civilization. These lands are a Wicked Cauldron of desperate evil.<br/><br/>Here adventure abounds, for the Empress has called a Crusade to root out all the evil that hounds her northern domains.

Here's a game description from the back of the box:<br/><br/>&quot;For a brief period the Industrial Revolution burned so bright that Britain was known as the 'Workshop of the World.' This Ragnar Brothers' game recreates that dramatic time. Players establish their position on the map-board by investing in ports, heavy industries, textiles, light industries and crafts. Canal networks are built to connect the thriving towns. Expenditure is vast, but capital gains are greater. Next the railways are built and each player seeks to strengthen their industrial base. By game end, towns are linked from London to Wales, Scotland to the Channel ports. Wealth decides the winner.&quot;<br/><br/>And here's the game play described in more detail:<br/><br/>&bull; The game lasts two eras &ndash; the Canal Era and Railroad Era &ndash; with players earning money at the end of each era.<br/><br/>&bull; Before starting an era, players each reveal one of their two demand tokens to show which towns (ports, textile locations, etc.) have special value.<br/><br/>&bull; Each era lasts a number of rounds, and in each round players reveal town cards equal to the number of players, then hold an auction for turn order.

Some say he was a powerful sorcerer, others say he was a god.  In searching for this fabled ruby, I have found that this region did not become a desert until after this vile man died.  Once his vast power was taken with him into the afterlife, its horrible absence left a terrible blight upon the land.<br/><br/>&quot;Regardless of the effects of his disappearance, Amun Khonshu was a murderer and a tyrant who ruled over the people of these lands by a fanatical death cult dedicated to his advancement.  Fortunately, upon Amun Khonshu's death, his cult was driven underground and eventually destroyed by neighboring nations.  But before the cult was vanquished, the servants of Amun Khonshu managed to preserve their leader's body and seal it away in a secret tomb, along with his vast store of ill-gotten treasure.  Legend has it that they left the enchanted ruby there as well, to guide his soul back to his mortal frame.<br/><br/>&quot;Good people, I believe I have found the location of this tomb, but my own band of associates was sadly not up to the task of surmounting the perils of the Ninva Desert.  I beg you, please help me find the Heart of Amun Khonshu to save my friend.

For the first time anywhere, Alexander Jodorowski, co-creator of The Incal and The Metabaron, reveals never-before-seen details about the amazing universe of the Metabaron. Learn the secret histories of the Human Empire, the Shabda-Oud Sisterhood, and the parallel universes that surround our own. Explore the alliances and conspiracies that hold the Empire together (and threaten to tear it apart). Learn why the Necro-Dream is so dangerous, and how close Mankind stands to ultimate oblivion.<br/><br/>The Universe Guide sheds new light on many aspects of daily life in the Human Empire, and delves into the structure and organization of the Imperial Government (the Senate, the Noble Houses, the Techno-Pontificate, the Ekonomat, and the Maganats), the Mentreks, the Endogaurd, the Shabda-Oud, the Metabaron, and the Colonials. Also covered are secret societies, cults and religions, notable planets, The Golden Palace of the Emperoress, the Imperial Navy, and the limitations and hazards of hyperspace travel.<br/><br/>Extensive sections on the history of the universe include a time-line of events for the &quot;The Incal&quot; and &quot;The Metabarons,&quot; tracing the growth of the empire and the family of the Metabaron. Players of The Metabarons Roleplaying Game will find a wealth of new character templates and professions, new rules for aliens and mutants, new weapons and cybernetics, a detailed anatomy of a typical Endocity, new vehicles and robots, resources for creating exciting galaxy-spanning adventures, and at long last, the hidden secrets of the Metabunker, the invincible fortress of the Metabarons.<br/><br/>The first edition of the Metabarons Universe Guide was published (in French) in 2001. The English translation for the abridged .PDF version was provided by Diane Bertrand, Justin Kelly, and Joan Wilchins. Thank you for your work!<br/><br/>The .PDF version includes the following note.<br/><br/>Note to Readers:<br/>The Abridged PDF (English) version of the Universe Guide was created from the original electronic files. Selected images and text were left out or modified, and the page layout was modified to reduce file size and production time. This electronic document was conceived as a relatively inexpensive means for people to get information about the Metabarons Universe that was previously unavailable.

After two years of waiting, your family holds a memorial service and your partner is now returning to a social life as a single person. You might be a great survivor, but at what cost?<br/><br/>Each turn players can beachcomb for useful items such as rope, old bits of wire and driftwood. You might even find a pilot's hat or laminated crash instructions washed up from the azure, salty brine. These pieces of flotsam and jetsam are shown on 52 professionally printed cards and represented by brightly coloured, chunky 3D shapes which can be linked neatly together on your individual player mat to build items essential for survival.<br/><br/>Players must strike a balance between plundering the island&rsquo;s resources for points while ensuring they&rsquo;re not last off the island. Finish too low down on the time-track and you'll accrue penalty points which could rob you of victory.<br/><br/>It's all about strategy, and fun puzzle solving. Some of your inventory items can only be built using a single colour, while others allow two or all three. Also, some grids are larger than others, taking longer to build, some are small and awkward to fit all the available shapes into.<br/><br/>Upgrades can give you more playing power, such as extra card swaps and extra jokers; longer explore moves; greater fish catches. Which to go for first? It's up to you to try the many different combinations.<br/><br/>To start, you are only allowed to build two items at a time so think carefully... whittle away by the fire at base camp, or set out deep into the island in search of vines and timber to help strengthen your small raft, ready for the final ordeal across raging seas...<br/><br/>source: from publisher: Solway Games<br/><br/>"}, "67580": {"rpgartist": ["Steve A.
