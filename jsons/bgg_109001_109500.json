When  I talk about &quot;OD&amp;D,&quot; I'm referring to Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons  (published in 1974), which included three booklets: Men &amp; Magic,  Monsters &amp; Treasure, and The Underworld &amp; Wilderness Adventures.  There were multiple rules supplements released for OD&amp;D, including  Greyhawk, Blackmoor, Eldritch Wizardy, and Gods, Demi-gods, &amp;  Heroes. There is also Swords &amp; Spells, a set of miniature rules based  on D&amp;D and Chainmail. Lastly, I consider the Holmes Basic Set as a  close relation of the OD&amp;D family. My personal OD&amp;D game consists of  rules from the three brown books, plus house-rules (i.e. I'm not using  many rules from the supplements).

Occasionally, one would call, &quot;Cherokee five five zulu with you at three thousand five hundred.&quot; The player would have to ask the VFR pilot to squawk their transponder, making the VFR craft's icon bloom on the screen. This separated the calling aircraft's icon from other identical VFR icons on the screen. Within a short time frame, the player had to attach the correct ident (55Z) to the VFR aircraft. The squawked icon would only bloom for a few seconds. If too much time passed, the player had to repeat the request and try again. It becomes essential to have the sound working properly if you want to handle this VFR traffic , else it becomes necessary to scroll up/down your dialogue window to see the calls made by any VFR entering so that you may call them with their proper call sign or you can not identify them and consequently control them.<br/><br/>It is worth mentioning that in this TRACON for Windows version the player is given the option to work in TRACON or RAPCON but under RAPCON we simply see a classic Terminal Area Control over some military sectors, without any apparent possibility of reverting to the Precision Approach Radar position.<br/><br/>The Windows version of Tracon can be run directly under Linux by means of the Wine application.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tracon II&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "109044": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1233324.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"], "boardgamepublisher": ["nestorgames"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1233324_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "description": "Spline+ was evolved from Spline by adding ball movement.

The objective is to gather as many victory points for your side as possible. Both the attacking and defending players are in command of a specific sector of the battlefield, and each player is awarded with a personal score based on how the battle fares &ndash; but no one commander can win the whole war. The players need to help each other out of tight spots, for each commander has a different area of expertise, with weaker proficiency in other areas. Only by working together can the players prevent the enemy from exploiting these weaknesses, and only by working together can they bring the enemy to their knees!<br/><br/>In addition to mixing cooperation with competition, the core of the gameplay ensures that the players practically have no downtime at all. You are either attacking or defending all the time, eliminating the need to wait for your turn.<br/><br/>Iron Sky: The Board Game takes a different approach to the universe of Iron Sky. The movie may focus on the main characters, but the board game gives players direct control over the whole global war effort &ndash; and there's no way of knowing which side will emerge victorious.

As such, the module is designed to run quickly, hopefully bringing the players to the final scene within three to four hours. Game Masters wishing to extend play time will be given the opportunity with specially flagged sections labelled Further Adventures that lend themselves to ad lib gaming, or even full adventures. Only the original 'The Babylon Project' sourcebook rules are required to play.<br/><br/>It is thanks to European GenCon that you are able to play this module. With their blessing, I have now released a revised edition of my original adventure. As it was designed to be played in a tournament where every player is given a pre-written character to play, relationships, contacts and group dynamics were very tightly woven into the game, thus the need for a revision of the module to 'Version 2.0'.<br/><br/>Ideally, the Player Characters should all know each other and be familiar with working together to varying degrees. For the adventure to succeed there should be a reason for them to be hired as private investigators, or at least be known as people who are reasonable at finding things. The adventure begins with the Player Characters on Babylon 5, waiting for their new commission to meet with them. How this event comes to pass is left up to the Game Master to decide, based on his/her group's situation.<br/><br/>The adventure is set in the August of 2258. Commander Jeffrey Sinclair is in charge of the station, while Lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova is second in command.<br/><br/>This adventure ties in closely with a season 1 episode of Babylon 5 titled &quot;Signs and Portents&quot;. It would be an excellent idea if Game Masters were to review this episode before playing the module.<br/><br/>"}, "109103": {"rpgdesigner": ["Maverik Bishop", "Scott Gladstein"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "Dogs of War", "rpgartist": ["Andrew Bortniak"], "rpgproducer": ["Scott Gladstein"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1946330.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "9", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Little Red Goblin Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1946330_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Cry havoc!

The Curling Card Game is a fun, fast paced card game suitable for curling fans of all ages.  Grab your teammates and take on your fiercest rivals to decide once and for all who really rules the ice.  Or go head-to-head against a fellow curler to determine who will be King of the Rings.<br/><br/>Playable by two, four, six or even eight players, Hurry Hard! recreates all the action on the ice in a fun, easy to learn card game.  Players take turns throwing guards, draws, or takeouts.  Your teammates can then improve the impact of your throw, including through the play of the powerful Hurry Hard! sweeping card to help get your rock a little closer to the button. Watch out though!  Your opponents can also affect your throw.  The timely play of a Miss the Broom card can ruin an end, unless you have a Plan B card in reserve.  After the player with The Hammer throws the last rock, the score for the end is calculated the same as in real curling, based on whose rocks are closest to the button.  Then a new end begins.<br/><br/>For non-curlers, the rules explain not just how to play the card game, but also the basic terminology to help you understand the game of curling itself.<br/><br/>For curlers, the game has been well balanced to reward real curling strategy.  Deciding when to throw a guard or when to come into the rings can make the difference between scoring a big end or giving up a steal.  Just as with real curling, though, no matter how good your strategy, you still need to make your throws.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Hurry Hard!

In 1625, the Thirty Years' War is underway, and military leaders like Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim are roaming the country, fighting for land, and trying to establish the best of everything for themselves. The game lasts two &quot;years,&quot; with players taking actions in the spring, summer, and fall, then possibly suffering from grain shortage and revolts in the winter before scoring points for the year. After two years, the player with the most points &ndash; with points being scored for land and buildings under one's control &ndash; wins.<br/><br/>In each of the &quot;action&quot; seasons, ten action cards are shuffled, then laid out, with five face-up and the rest face-down. The five bonus tiles (which provide extra money, grain, or armies) are also laid out. Each player then secretly assigns one of his county cards (or a blank card) to each of the ten actions on his individual player board, in addition to bidding for player order and choice of bonus tile.<br/><br/>After revealing that round's event card and determining player order, players carry out actions in the order determined earlier, revealing which county is taking the current action, then revealing the next face-down action, thus giving players some information about when actions will occur, but not all. Taxing a county or taking grain from it can increase the chance of a revolt during winter, but without money you can't deploy troops or build palaces or churches and without grain you increase the chance of revolt.<br/><br/>Combat and revolts are handled via a dice tower in which players drop army units and peasants (colored wooden cubes) into the top of the tower and see which ones emerge in the bottom tray (representing the fighting forces for that combat) and which get stuck in the tower's baffles to possibly emerge in the future.<br/><br/>Wallenstein includes two expansions: &quot;Emperor's Court,&quot; in which a player's army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; a player can convert armies to courtiers during the game, and whoever has the most courtiers in the court's entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available. &quot;Landsknechte,&quot; which can be used with &quot;Emperor's Court&quot; or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order. If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as money or armies in the tray) shown on the newly revealed card.

Where a large adventure-style MUD might have 3,000 rooms, TriadCity will have more than 100,000 when complete, with tens of thousands of automated and non-automated characters interacting. And this includes just the world inside the city walls: a potentially infinite world awaits outside.<br/><br/>Literary orientation means that narrative techniques from the novel and other traditions are incorporated, such as voice, point of view, characterization, plot, and so on. Various forms of subjectivity are imposed on the characters which players create, some relative, some radical. This means that character histories and views of the world are potentially unique to each individual player.

Players fight to win battles in a futuristic civil war with a variety of ship types. From the agile and speedy Fighters, to lethal Gunships and intimidating Capital Ships, every battle is a well-balanced slugfest that comes right down to the wire. Our new Trinity Mechanic uses boards, cards and dice together in an extremely innovative and easy-to-learn system that lets new players jump right in.<br/><br/>What makes the Gunship series unique are the numerous combinations of ships that the players &quot;build&quot; at the start of each battle. By choosing from an ever-growing selection (through expansions) of available Weapons and Upgrades, players are able to create a custom Gunship that is suited to their particular style of play or battle situation. Some guys are &quot;defensive&quot; minded; they'll choose Heavy Armor, +1 Shield Generators and 4 Blaster Cannons to fend off the enemy Gunship. But another player might prefer to build a &quot;Carrier Killer&quot; complete with wings full of Bombs and an Autoblaster Cannon to shred his way through the enemy Fighter Squadron. While most of the Upgrade cards are geared toward the Gunships (the true star of the show) you can also do some great things to your Fighters and Capital Ships. New kinds of ships will come with every expansion to further add to the possibilities. No two battles are ever the same!<br/><br/>In Gunship: First Strike!, the civil war has just started. Your orders are simple: Command a task force of one Assault Carrier and its Gunship and Fighters on a mission to destroy the enemy's Carrier. Guess what? He has the very same orders! Dogfights will ensue, Torpedoes will strike home and Thruster Bombs are going to pound the Capital Ships mercilessly. If your Gunship takes too much damage for comfort, or if the battle situation changes and you want a different weapon load, land inside your Carrier for a quick &quot;pit stop&quot;. Make sure that you defend it with all your might because once your Carrier is gone, the only option left to you is to flee the battlespace and hope to take revenge another day.<br/><br/>As the Gunship universe grows, players will be able to fight bigger and bigger battles. Soon the objectives will include breaking through the enemy picket line to drop troops on the planet below. The Gunships will be called upon to not only assault other ships, but also to go dirtside and give air support to the land battle raging below  A free Campaign System is planned where players can keep track of a fleet of ships and territories. Lose your Carrier in today's battle and you might lose a critical Outpost next week. Don't let the enemy find the Shipyard where your damaged Destroyers limped home last time &ndash; if he does, they're toast!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.04232", "name": "Gunship: First Strike!", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Press Your Luck"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["144021", "146635", "146649", "121531", "121532", "121529", "140062", "154757", "137559", "143980"], "usersrated": "211", "boardgameaccessory": ["Gunship: Punchboard Unit Tokens"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games", "Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Gunship"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["The Gaming Gang Extra #30: Escape Pod Games"]}, "109217": {"poll": [], "name": "Odell Lake", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Apple II edition"], "average": "5.5", "videogametheme": ["Animals", "Science / Technology"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium"], "videogamegenre": ["Educational", "Life Simulation", "Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Apple II"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium"], "description": "Odell Lake was an early educational life simulation game, produced by MECC for the Apple II and Commodore 64 computers.

The box contains a plastic tray to hold the cards and the tokens.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt two cards, and the remaining cards form a draw pile.  The first player draws a blind card and then lays one card from their hand face up on the table.  Playing clockwise, each player takes a turn, drawing a card and playing a card on the table.  Cards must be placed, edge to edge, so the colors match.  Players must place a card if they are able, but rows of cards cannot exceed three cards in length.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to create squares of cards and claim them with the colored tokens.  Additionally, your can seize an existing square if you are able to replace one of the cards on the table with a card from your hand.  The first player to claim four squares wins.

Your character uses her body as a power source for magic instead of relying on materials or a deity. Prior incarnations of psionic magic has relied on a system of points and others have relied entirely on uses per day (or vancian, spell-slot-based magic). This book provides your character a flexible system that uses both and works within the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. The following provides a summary of our interpretation of psionics for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.<br/><br/>Psionic spellcasters accumulate ki points, just like a monk or ninja and use this power to rearrange their spell allotment, augment their spells, and use various abilities. The psionic spellcaster, just like the sorcerer and bard, knows a set number of powers and spells and can cast these spontaneously. The power of those spells is based on their ki pool total or their caster level, whichever is lower. Ki points can be spent to regain a spell use and spells can be sacrificed to regain ki. In total, the psionic spell caster has must more power, balance, and flexibility than older incarnations of the psionicist.<br/><br/>All of the spells have been reviewed and updated to blend with existing rules. Spells that were identical to arcane and divine spells with different names were converted to match existing spells.<br/><br/><br/>    The entire energy spell-line was redesigned to provide a little more balance but still allowing the flexibility to using multiple, and even more, energy types.<br/>    Disciplines were moved to spell descriptors so that all spells followed the same rules.<br/>    Spell schools were added to all psionic spells to allow for use of existing feats and abilities.<br/>    Metamagic works for all three spell types (or magic power sources).<br/><br/><br/>The psion is a blend of the original psion and wilder classes and is an alternate sorcerer class. Each psion can specialized in a discipline and get unique abilities similar to the sorcerer bloodline.<br/><br/>Undisciplined psions have the abilities of the wilder.<br/><br/>The psyker is a blend of the original psychic warrior and soulknife classes and is an alternate bard class. The psyker gains the ability over time to create many different soul weapons instead of just a sword or bow.<br/><br/>Because there are no somatic components, there is no penalty for wearing heavier armor.<br/><br/>Psionic feats are now available to all characters with a ki pool, giving a nice increase in available feats to monks and ninjas.<br/><br/>Only one new skill was added: Knowledge (Psionics) to match the Knowledge (Arcana) and Knowledge (Religion) skills.<br/><br/>Ki focus is useable by all characters with a ki pool to use certain feats and abilities. The ability to gain ki focus is similar to concentration for casting spells. It has very similar variables and difficulties.<br/><br/>Alternate rules are provided for spell/power point systems and treating psionics as a different magic type.<br/><br/>Note: The playtest for this product is now available as a free download from paizo.com.<br/><br/>"}, "109243": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jeffrey S.

These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.<br/><br/>The setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate &mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable &mdash; failure &mdash; which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes.<br/><br/>Like the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding.

The result is that Nations in Arms is an entirely new, and very playable, Napoleonic epic from designer Fran\u00e7ois-Stanislas Thomas.<br/><br/>Players control every major and minor power of the Napoleonic period: from the largest participants to the smallest. This allows anywhere from 2 to 7 players to participate in the game.

You will have the power of great leaders at your fingertips, and the might of the corps they commanded: line infantry, guards, militia, supply trains, light and reserve cavalry, fleets and more.<br/><br/>Each game year is broken into four interactive, seasonal turns.

Based on the game system used in Wings of Glory (formerly Wings of War), Sails of Glory uses miniatures, cards and board game mechanisms, with a special deck of maneuver cards representing the different movement capabilities of each vessel. The game will be supported by a range of painted and assembled 1/1000 miniatures.<br/><br/>Players will choose their maneuver cards in secret, then reveal them all at the same moment. The card features arrows to be put in front of the miniature, then the latter is moved on top of the arrowhead. Several options on the same card are available depending on the wind and, with advanced rules, the sails used.

Where does the wind come from, what is it made of, and how can it wield so much power?<br/><br/>The pages of fantasy fiction are filled with the mysteries of air-castles in the sky, weapons made of wind, and creatures like djinni and elementals, who seem to be the very air itself brought to life. Certainly, the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook captures some of the power and mystery contained in the element of air &mdash; but that is expressed mostly in the form of movement-based or defensive spells when, as anyone who has ever been caught unprotected in the face of an oncoming gale will attest, air can also serve as a most formidable weapon.<br/><br/>Air vs. Storm<br/><br/>Air magic often overlaps with storm and weather magic, with spells such as control weather and control winds both being able to create tornadoes and hurricane-force winds under the right conditions. For the most part, The Genius Guide to Air Magic focuses only on air spells, leaving more lightning- and rain-focused spells for other venues. Even so there is some overlap (thunder, being a phenomenon entirely of air, sneaks into a few of our spells), and the new class options presented at the end of this product go further afield than the spells themselves (the druidic storm lord being the most obvious case). We also explore some concepts connected to specifically named winds (such as the chinook and sirocco spells), some of which have very little bearing on a scientific understanding of how air actually behaves and functions.

It begins by discussing the use of crystal foci in a campaign and describing the difference between normal crystals and those particularly suited for use in viewing or healing. Next you&rsquo;ll find a collection of new spells for all the spellcasting base classes and the addition of a new [crystal] descriptor for spells that tie directly to the heart of crystal magic&mdash;healing, scrying, and drawing on the inherent magical power of crystals and gemstones. In addition there are new crystal-themed class options to enable the creation spellcasters whose focus is the magic of crystals.

In them we can be and do anything our minds can conceive, the laws of nature hold no sway, and despite the fact that they seem as real as the waking world you walk through, there are no consequences for any of the actions you take or injuries you may suffer. Dreams are real, yet unreal&mdash;which is also as perfect description of magic as you are ever likely to find. So it makes perfect sense to find a way to blend the two together for use in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.<br/><br/>Dreams have often been associated with prophesy and other supernatural powers. People say they are sometimes visited in their dreams by the spirits of the dead, the forces of nature, and even the gods themselves. Upon waking, one&rsquo;s head is often filled with inexplicable information, and stories persist of people even bringing important items back with them from their dreams. Bad dreams can haunt us during our waking hours and particularly powerful nightmares can sometimes cause us to injure ourselves while we sleep or even make sleep impossible entirely.<br/><br/>In fantasy fiction, the realm of dreams is often a real place that exists beyond the mortal world&mdash;somewhere that our minds wander when we sleep, and that we can physically travel to if we open the right magical doors. Different versions of this dream realm can be seen in books and movies (and a suggested reading/viewing list is provided at the end of this volume), but perhaps the most influential is H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s Dreamlands &mdash; a place where whole lives are lived, destinies forged, without most residents ever even being aware of our &ldquo;real&rdquo; world.<br/><br/>While dreams play a strong role in fantasy fiction, they are underserved in terms of game rules. The Genius Guide to Dream Magic provides a way to bring the power and influence of dreams into your campaign in a more than superficial way. It contains a collection of new spells (many of which feature the new [dreaming] descriptor) plus a sorcerous bloodline, clerical domain, and wizard specialty that focus on this new dream magic. It also describes the Dreamscape &mdash; an ever-changing demiplane where dreamers, and sometimes waking characters, can go&mdash;and the creatures that call it home.<br/><br/>"}, "109320": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph J.

The core roles of other elements are easy to see&mdash;fire burns your foes and grants light, air allows for flight and control of the weather, and water allows ships to move and wells to bring life to farms, plus is the secret domain of sailors and merfolk. The easy uses for these elements in magic are often quickly covered, leading to the exploration of alternative uses. This results in broader magic options that only loosely relate to the most basic functions of air, fire, and water. Scrying pools, holy flames, and killing vapors are time-honored examples of drawing on those three elements without having much to do with real water, fire, or air. This kind of development is a good thing, giving characters with strong elemental themes a wide range of powers to choose from.<br/><br/>Because it is generally less dynamic in its natural state, earth seems to have been given short shrift when magic powers were being developed. While the basic ideas of creating walls of metal and rock or borrowing the durability of stone for personal protection are common, few campaigns have the expanded selection needed to make a rock-themed spellcaster a viable and interesting option. The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game expands the range of earth magic some by adding a connection to acid (see &ldquo;Acidic Earth&rdquo;, below), but this still leaves earth with significantly fewer options than the other elements. The Genius Guide to Earth Magic looks to develop earth and stone magic, both by expanding the applications for &ldquo;typical&rdquo; acidic earth magic and by adding a new [stone] descriptor for spells that deal damage using rocks as weapons.<br/><br/>"}, "109321": {"rpgartist": ["P\u00e9ter Sz\u00e1bo Gab\u00f3r", "Shaman's Stockart", "Manda Panda Stocks"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Exalted Domains of Light and Lore", "rpgdesigner": ["Marc Radle"], "rpgproducer": ["Robert N.

Clerics show this deep devotion to their deity in many ways, one of the most important of which is the selection of their two granted domains. The choice of specific domains helps to shape and define the cleric, and it defines what aspects of their gods are foremost in the cleric&rsquo;s faith and worship.<br/><br/>Some clerics, however, choose not to divide their energy and devotion between two different domains. Instead they dedicate themselves completely to a single domain, becoming paragons of one aspect of their deities. In return for sacrificing the flexibility and power that comes from a second domain, such clerics gain deeper understanding of one philosophic concept, unlocking more potent abilities linked to their chosen divine focus. This greater understanding and might comes in the form of an Exalted domain.<br/><br/>In this product we introduce the concept of the Exalted domain, and we present a selection of domains that some might consider offensive in nature.

Fire represents the power of civilization, through cooking, forging, ceramics, and the production of light. It also represents the power of destruction in that it is a threat to farm, forest, and city alike. Fire is the first magic, and the power to rub sticks together to create a living heat that breathes and moves is the first shaman&rsquo;s trick.<br/><br/>Sometimes fire is the preferred tool of evil, with dragons breathing it, demons living in it, and evil warlocks using it to burn out their enemies. In other stories it is the primary tool of good, used to burn out the dens of wickedness and sin where only evil lives, and illuminate the darkest corners of the world. These approaches speak to the dual nature of fire: It produces both light and smoke, it can forge or melt, and it cooks or chars. Fire is an invaluable tool, but it is also a dangerous weapon that can turn on its master.<br/><br/>Of course, fire magic certainly isn&rsquo;t under-represented in the core rules of the game. Indeed one of the most iconic spells in the game&rsquo;s entire history is fireball, and the acquisition of that spell is a milestone in most wizards&rsquo; careers. But the very fact that fire is so ubiquitous among spellcasters often means GMs and players alike are looking for new ways to burn, char, and ignite foes. In addition to providing more typical burning-globe fire spells, we also took the opportunity to look at fire-related magic dealing in molten glass, smoke, steam, and the potential self-imposed dangers of playing with fire.<br/><br/>"}, "109325": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph J.

A great deal of the sense of the fantastic in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game comes from arcane magic.<br/><br/>Fantasy stories are also full of rogues who once trained with master wizards and retain a bit of that knowledge, bored swordsmen who happen to have vast resources available if they call on ancient pacts, wondrous magisters able to access many forms of magic, and semi-competent sorcerers with powers they barely understand and have trouble controlling.

At each level, a member of each race can take one of the listed options when taking a level of a specific class as a favored class, as opposed to the normal bonus of +1 hit point or +1 skill point.<br/><br/>Since many of our readers like to use material from a variety of sources, along with options drawn from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, the alternative favored class options presented here include base classes that have been published in the Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide and the Genius Guide line of products.

It&rsquo;s a truism of running a campaign. Not only do you want to keep your players guessing and keep creating new challenges for them, but you also very likely want a broad range of thematic choices from which to draw. It&rsquo;s not enough to have just a few CR 5 choices. Instead, these gamers want a few CR choices for every type, theme, and role a monster might play. After all, if you are running a campaign built around the rise of the goblinoids, you need lots of different goblins to populate your adventures. The more monsters to choose from, the better!<br/><br/>But sometimes you have the right monster for an adventure, and it has the exact look, the perfect theme, and the tailored feel, but you can&rsquo;t use it because the CR is wrong. Even if a manticore is exactly the guardian you wanted for the Lore Vault of the City of Refuge, if you&rsquo;re running a CR 9 adventure, a CR 5 manticore won&rsquo;t work. You do have options, of course. You could run an encounter with 4 manticores, but too much of a good thing can become monotonous and make a fight drag. You can advance the 6 HD manticore to CR 10 by taking on about 8 HD, but that&rsquo;s a complicated process that involves adding new ability score increases, feats, skill points, and possibly a size increase. If you plan for characters to face the same manticore (or its kin) several times, the effort might be worth it, but not for a single encounter.<br/><br/>Or, you can just tack on the &ldquo;mighty&rdquo; simple template, which takes less than a minute.<br/><br/>Simple templates are designed to require a minimum of rewriting of a creature&rsquo;s stat block. In essence they are all designed to work like the quick rules of the monster advancement templates presented in the Bestiary. In a few cases this might lead to creature statistics not matching exactly what they would be if the same monster was built from scratch. For example, the sample missing creature, the missing lynx, is a magical beast, but its statistics are still largely those of a creature of the animal type. Although this is an inconsistency in numbers, it has no effect on how the creature plays within the game, and the extra work required to convert d8 Hit Dice to d10s isn&rsquo;t the best use of a GM&rsquo;s time. Although the type of a creature can have a real impact on play (interacting with a ranger&rsquo;s favored enemies, bane weapons, and similar game rules), and its hit point total is important, the size of its Hit Dice doesn&rsquo;t actually matter.<br/><br/>Presented within this product are six simple templates that can give GMs options to boost the CR of the monsters they need, create new threats their players aren&rsquo;t expecting, and multiply the usefulness of the hundreds of monsters already at their fingertips. Having a two-headed template doesn&rsquo;t replace the ettin, but it does allow for two-headed dragons, twin-skulled canines, and even freakish multicranial golems. The simplicity of the templates keeps them from being a chore to add, and they allow a GM to create new foes almost on the fly.<br/><br/>"}, "109336": {"rpgdesigner": ["R.

It started as a phrase used after the results of an attack were determined, but quickly made its way into variant systems and house rules until nearly every campaign had its own version. And in many of these systems, both what was necessary to inflict a &ldquo;crit&rdquo; and the results of that attack varied depending on the situation. And if you played under more than one GM, the chances were good that each one would have a different definition and set of achievable results for critical hits in his or he game.<br/><br/>With the arrival of the OGL and original d20 System games, critical hits became a codified part of the core rules. The details have changed slightly with rules updates, and again as with the development of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, but at this point there is an agreed upon definition of what constituted a critical hit. But, at the same time, a good deal of the mystique has been removed from the notion. Players now not only know exactly what is needed to achieve a crit, they also know just what the results will be&mdash;some extra damage. Certainly that has a tangible impact on the game, but it doesn&rsquo;t fire the imagination or capture the visceral impact that many of the old house rules did.<br/><br/>The Genius Guide to Feats of Critical Combat works with the existing rules regarding critical hits, providing ways for players to put some of the &ldquo;critical&rdquo; back into their critical hits. Shatter shields, inflict disfiguring scars, achieve advantage over others on the field of battle&mdash;all these and more are possible effects for your character&rsquo;s crits, depending on the feats you choose. Bring the shock and awe back to the battlefield, and remember the power of seeing a natural &ldquo;20&rdquo; on the die.

Going first is its own reward, allowing a player to get the jump on foes, grab points of tactical advantage, and set the tone for the combat to come, but it&rsquo;s also just fun. Finding yourself at the bottom of the initiative order is significantly less exciting. For low rollers, the combat round can seem to lag on, having little to do but watch while other players accumulate memorable moments. Sometimes a player going last doesn&rsquo;t even pay attention to the action until it gets close to his time to take a turn, assuming he can &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; once his character gets to go. This often leads to delays as players must have recent combat events explained, need time to look up rules for whatever action they decide to take based on that update, and get feedback from other players who now aren&rsquo;t paying attention until it&rsquo;s close to their turn. The longer it is between player turns the more likely players are to tune out, which only adds to the length of time between turns.<br/><br/>The whole game goes much smoother and is more enjoyable for everyone when all the players stay involved mentally, actively absorbing the current action while waiting for their own moments of glory. That is much more likely to occur when there is some kind of combat action that the character can perform at any time&mdash;a way to occasionally jump the queue and join the battle right now. (Just think about how much more attention a player pays if his character has delayed his action.) Even if such options have consequences, the possibility itself encourages the players to stay focused on what&rsquo;s happening at all times so that they&rsquo;re able to react quickly when they can make a difference. To that end, we need a way for characters to perform actions out of the normal initiative order, to link its use to specific combat situations so players want to pay attention, and to make sure the cost of doing so is high enough that it&rsquo;s not happening every round, but low enough players feel taking such an action is worthwhile.<br/><br/>A look at Chapter 8 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook reveals an interesting combat option&mdash;between &ldquo;swift actions&rdquo; and &ldquo;miscellaneous actions&rdquo; is the very promising sounding &ldquo;immediate action.&rdquo; The immediate action fills all the gaps we&rsquo;ve identified; it just needs of broader set of options. To answer that need, we present a new set of immediate action feats&mdash;feats that give characters new actions they may perform in specific situations if they are willing to spend an immediate action.<br/><br/>The Genius Guide to Feats of Immediate Action gives characters more potential ways to act when it is not their turn, encourages new tactical opportunities to spice up game play, creates a more flexible and reactive battle field, and gives players a strong incentive to pay attention throughout the combat round.<br/><br/>Nobody likes waiting for their turn and with immediate action feats you will never have to wait for your turn again.<br/><br/>"}, "109341": {"rpgartist": ["Caryad", "Michael Jaecks", "Don-Oliver Matthies", "J\u00f6rg Raddatz"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Codex Monstrorum", "rpgdesigner": ["Heike Kamaris", "J\u00f6rg Raddatz"], "rpgproducer": ["Ralf Berszuck", "Florian Don-Schauen"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1105304.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": ["Myranor"], "average": "6.33333", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Ulisses Spiele"], "rpg": ["Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (4th Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1105304_t.jpg", "description": "Information about the fauna of Myranor, written as a journal of a natural scientist and big game hunter.<br/><br/>From the back of the core rulebook:<br/><br/>Im dampfenden Urwald, in der endlosen Steppe, im eisigen Gebirge, zu Land und im Meer lauern gef&auml;hrliche und eigenartige myranische Ungeheuer auf arglose Reisende.

While most of the obvious spell enhancements (increasing some numeric value of spell game mechanics or removing some component to make casting easier) are covered in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, those basic functions merely scratch the surface of what metamagic is capable of doing. The Genius Guide to Feats of Metamagic aims to expand the options into new areas, creating feats that changing how spells affect different targets, affect how a character uses all metamagic, and even weakening spells to lower their effective level.<br/><br/>New feats for spellcasters should mean more metamagic feats, to allow powers and classes (especially prestige classes) that depend on metamagic to gain new options and to increase the variety of builds for metamagic-using spellcasters.

Spellcasters may wish to apply metamagic to focus their use of elemental spells (such as with Exchanged Spell), use metamagic to combine several commonly used combat spells into a single spellcasting action (with Cascade Spell), or explore a new kind of metamagic that allows them to cast a spell with a lesser spell slot by limiting some of its usual parameters (such as Weaken Spell). While there are a few feats that modify the use of all metamagic (such as a Metamagic Focus), the aim of this product is to help broaden the range of strategies spellcasters have for executing their spells so that is commensurate with the many ways nonspellcasters have to use combat maneuvers.<br/><br/>"}, "109343": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph J.

Each &ldquo;Behind the Counter&rdquo; sidebar explains how a price was arrived at, allowing GMs to apply the logic to other items with similar abilities (and be better able to change the pricing to suit the needs of their campaigns with a firm knowledge of where the numbers come from).<br/><br/>Unlike most Loot 4 Less volumes, for Krazy Kragnar&rsquo;s Used Chariots we first need to define a mundane version of the items offered. There is no &ldquo;chariot&rdquo; in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook (though there are listings for carriages and wagons in the equipment chapter). But chariots are common to many mythic and fictional fantasy adventure settings, and they definitely cost less than 2,500 gp, so even mundane chariots are legit fodder for this series of products&mdash;and having magic chariots takes just a bit more work. (Since we&rsquo;re not likely to do Wacky William&rsquo;s Well-Loved Wagons as a separate product, we&rsquo;ve included magic wagons, carriages, and other vehicles in this product, as well.)<br/><br/>Ideally, chariot rules would be a sub-set of vehicles rules... which also aren&rsquo;t found in the core rulebook. Of course, it&rsquo;s beyond the purview of a magic item supplement to present extensive, realistic, comprehensive new rules for as broad a category as vehicles. Still, it is possible to create a simple set of general vehicle rules, and then just enough more to allow characters to use chariots without having to add an extensive new rules subset.<br/><br/>There are two basic premises behind our proposed vehicle rules. First, a vehicle is treated like a creature when it is attended by a driver (that creature being the same as the mounts harnessed to it), and as an object when it is unattended (even if a team of mounts is harnessed to it). Second, skills and feats that work with a mount also work with a vehicle. Realistically driving a chariot and riding a horse are very different, but the Pathfinder RPG uses broad categories to allow heroes to easily be good at related sets of things, and we want to match that design philosophy here.<br/><br/>"}, "109354": {"rpgartist": ["Shaman's Stockart", "Skortched Urf' Studios", "Paul Slinger", "Frank Walls"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Belt One On", "rpgdesigner": ["Owen K.C.

Each player moves in turn commencing with a Plane.<br/>The Moves;<br/>The discs move according to the number obtained by spinning the arrow. The exact number of places must be moved each time and only one disc for each move. Planes must be moved forward (never backward).<br/>The red-circle shells move horizontal (sic) left or right only. The black-circle shell may move horizontal (left or right) or vertically (backwards or forwards) but not outside the green half of the board.<br/>Shells can move only if the number of spaces to be moved brings the shell to a circle of the same colour as a plane in play.<br/>Rules;<br/>The planes' player moves any plane he chooses. He may try to reach his objective with one at a time or more if he so desires, but he must not forego a move if it is possible to move a plane the required space.<br/>Shells may pass over planes but not over another shell.<br/>Planes may pass over another plane or shell.<br/>Losses;<br/>A plane is hit (and thus out of the game) if it comes to a circle occupied by a shell or if a shell hits the plane. That is, if a shell is able to move to a circle occupied by a plane. A hit is also registered if a plane comes to one of the red circles in the yellow half of the board, provided the red line is connected with a circle of the same colour as the plane and this circle has a shell on it or a shell hits it before the plane moves on.<br/>Now place the discs on the circles as marked taking care to put the black-circle shell on its appropriate circle.<br/>If the arrow should stop dead on a dividing line, spin it again.<br/><br/>These rules make a little more sense when you look at the images. Note that it is never properly explained who wins. Does the planes' player win if he gets just one plane to the objective? Or more?

So now they are venturing forth from their adopted home planet and in search of a cognate species which breeds freely and is able to give birth at least once per year, with a good growth rate and preferably (although a bit of crunch is acceptable) without an exoskeleton. The parasitoid race is no longer deterred by bright colouring of potential hosts as they know from experience that these are sometimes simple dye additives that some races ingest in a rather feeble attempt to suggest they may be toxic. In the past millennia the parasites have openly advertised their opening for a new host species, however this approach has never proven successful. To save time they now battle, capture, screen and select prospective hosts, it saves a lot of time in the long run. They have had 198 years to upgrade their battle fleet in between breeding and snacking and now want to change the menu. Mmm how tasty are you?<br/><br/>What The Parasites Expansion Pack Contains:<br/><br/>10 New ships. 4 Cruisers 3 Frigates and 3 fighters, all in a new graphical style by the same artist who did the original GSB artwork. The parasite ships have multiple translucent sections in varying colors, coming accross as classy, expensive, but also not to be messed with..<br/><br/>3 New ship equipment:  The flak cannon is a cruiser weapon designed to target enemy fighter swarms. The cannon ahs an 'area-of-effect' damage as well as hitting the target ship. The Plasma slinger is a small but ultra-high-rate-of-fire plasma torpedo weapon. This is the first plasma weapon that can have multiple torpedoes in flight at the same time. The missile revenge scrambler is a whole new type of ECM weapon that actually sends missile back to attack the ship that launched them, rather thamn just scrambling their guidance systems.<br/><br/>New ship bonuses. The parasites build these ships to last. Most of the new hulls have both integrity and armor bonuses. The parasites aren't so good on the shields front, but they make up for it with stronger armor.<br/><br/>1 New Scenario. One new map for you to fight against the parasites, and to use in online challenges.

There will be a time for song, time for cakes, time for long afternoon strolls, but this is not that time. There will be time for love, time for joy, time for writing that novel you know you have in you somewhere, but this is still not that time.<br/>This is a time for war. Huge war, galaxy-spanning war, where the cries for mercy from the citizens of captured worlds will reverberate around the bridge of your flagship. A time for honor, for glory, for huge profits for people in the defense industry. This is a time for galactic conquest.<br/><br/>Galactic conquest is the campaign meta-game add-on for gratuitous space battles. The campaign 'wraps-around' the battles, so they are no longer isolated clashes, but merely engagements in an ongoing galaxy-conquering campaign. When you decide to move one of your space fleets to an enemy-controlled planet, a normal GSB battle takes place, and the winner takes control of that system. This radically changes the tactics of the game. No longer can you design ships specifically to fight a single enemy fleet, but you are forced to think ahead, to design multi-role ships and fleets that can take on all comers.<br/><br/>The galaxy you fight over has 52 different planets, with you in control of just one of them at the start of the campaign. You can play as any race from Gratuitous Space Battles, or it's expansion packs, and in your attempt to conquer the galaxy you will come up against enemy fleets from all the different races, including expansion pack races (if installed). The fleets you encounter will not be AI - designed, but they are the creations of other GSB players. In a cunning 'massively-singleplayer' system, GC will constantly download the fleet and ship designs of other players to fight as your opponents, whilst uploading some of your fleets to fight against everyone else. This way you will be constantly challenged and surprised by enemy tactics and ship designs.<br/><br/>Galactic Conquest requires that you have the base game (Gratuitous Space Battles) already. You can have as many or as few race expansion packs installed as you like, the campaign will pick enemy races based on which races are already installed. You will also NEED an internet connection as you play the campaign, because of the games tight integration with the online server that selects enemies for you to fight.<br/><br/>"}, "109409": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph J.

But what do you do if you want to start an adventure before your wizards have mastered their 1st-level spells and paladins have discovered how to detect evil at will? The Genius Guide to Apprentice-Level Characters presents simple rules for creating 0-level or 1/2-level characters who have some instruction but aren&rsquo;t yet fully trained members of their class.<br/><br/>There are two typical ways to use apprentice-level characters. The first is to run a campaign where the characters start at level 0. Such characters begin with half the starting gold they&rsquo;d normally get at 1st level and usually represent characters that are still in training. If you want to begin a game at a training facility or in a village that is normally guarded by 1st-level warriors, having 0-level player characters would be appropriate. It takes 1/2 as many experience points to go from 0 to 1st level as it takes to go from 1st to 2nd level.<br/><br/>The other use of apprentice-level characters is to allow multiclass characters at 1st level. An apprentice-fighter/apprentice rogue is (roughly) the same as a 1st-level character, and allows the character to begin play with a mix of stealth and martial skill. When such a multiclass character reaches 2nd level, he becomes 1st level in both of the two classes, and proceeds normally from there.<br/><br/>While apprentice-level characters use the same basic rules for combat and actions as any Pathfinder Roleplaying Game character, there are a few specific questions that should be addressed in regards to these characters.<br/><br/>"}, "109410": {"rpgartist": ["Lin Bo", "Larry Elmore"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Expanded Favored Class Options", "rpgdesigner": ["Michael Kenway", "Owen K.C.

Members of specific races can get these benefits when they gain a level in a class that is listed as a favored class for their race. These rules are extremely interesting in that they add a new way to differentiate between characters, creating even more potential points of difference between two characters who take the same race and class combination. The options given in the Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide help make some iconic choices more interesting, since each race (other than human) is given favored class options for only a few classes.<br/><br/>A GM who wants to make different regions or organizations unique could also take the new &ldquo;racial&rdquo; options and instead link them to a specific kingdom, knightly order, or school. Doing so is a simple and effective way to help show the differences between the crofter-folk of the Misty Plains and the battle-hardened fighting tribes of the Frostweald, regardless of what races make up those societies. Of course such uses might result in needing a good set of favored class options for dwarf alchemists, elf gunslingers, and halfling barbarians.<br/><br/>To help GMs have more tools to make campaigns flavorful, and to support players with a taste for unusual class/race combinations, the Genius Guide to Expanded Favored Class Options fills in the &ldquo;missing&rdquo; class/race combinations, so every race has a favored class option for every class (including new classes, such as the magus, gunslinger, ninja, and samurai).

Most are members of powerful aristocracies, for only nobles can normally take the time required in youth to train for the rigors of both the mystic and martial worlds.

An archon studies and masters spells through training and intellect, as does a wizard. However, archons cannot call upon the vast range of fighting talents pure fighters learn, nor do they have the breadth of spells of other pure casters. An archon can&rsquo;t match a wizard in terms of spell level, spell slots per day, or spells known.

As a great tactician once noted, the best way to win a fight is to be the last man standing. Or, put more colloquially, sometimes the best offense is a good defense!<br/><br/>Armigers are masters of defense, able to shrug of attacks that would destroy lesser combatants, and even increase the survivability of those around them. The armiger is built around maximizing the benefit of armor and shields. With large hit point totals, special defense-related talents, and an aptitude for unusual shields, armigers can carry the fight forward under the most difficult circumstances. The best armigers often find themselves the main thing standing between victory and a total party kill.<br/><br/>While armigers can fight with most martial weapons, typically they focus on pole arms with reach or crossbows, giving them the ability to strike at foes without having to be on the front line of a battle. This allows armigers to play strong supporting roles and still manage to inflict damage on the enemy. An armiger certainly can fight with other weapons, but just as monks are generally at their best using unarmed attacks, most armigers function better when using reach or simple ranged weapons. Of course they also wear the best armor they can afford, regularly spending much more on shields and plate mail than weapons or comfort items. Armor is the core of an armiger&rsquo;s identity&mdash;an armiger treats his protective gear the way a cleric treats his holy symbol, or a samurai treats his katana.<br/><br/>Many armigers are famous heroes, well known for surviving horrific trials that crushed others before. An armiger may begin his career as a small town hero who, through sheer cussedness, outlasted a terrible troll on a battle over a local bridge. Or he may be a noble-born guardian of his people, trained from birth to wear the heavy armor only members of the upper class can afford. In some lands, entire brigades of armigers are legendary as specialty troops who provide an impenetrable blanket of protection&mdash;groups with names such as the Dwarven Ironhides or the Bullette Brigade.<br/><br/>Other armigers are the trusted aids of mighty knights, priests, and archmages&mdash;the right-hand men and most loyal supporters of important individuals. These armigers are often less well known than the great leaders and dignitaries they serve, but there presence is palpable and they are perceived as powers to be reckoned with. Killing an armiger&rsquo;s charge is almost always a secondary concern, to be handled only after you&rsquo;ve disposed of the armiger.<br/><br/>"}, "109414": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph J.

While a druid is servant to and master of the forces of nature&mdash;calling upon them for instruction, aid, and power&mdash;the death mage is similarly linked to the spirits and powers of the dead. This is an intellectual link rather than a spiritual one, for a death mage has chosen to immerse herself in the trappings of the dead and their graves. The first thing a death mage learns is to listen to the faint echoes left behind by spirits of the dead.

The godling is presented as both a base class (suitable for 1st level characters) and a prestige class (requiring characters to be higher level before taking it).<br/><br/>The godling is a mortal hero in whose veins flows the blood of a god. Cut from the same cloth as classic ancient heroes such as Theseus (fathered by both a mortal father, Aegeus, and a divine father, Poseidon), Memnon (son of a half-nymph mortal father and the titan/goddess Eos), and Helen (the famous beauty who was the daughter of Zeus), most godlings are the offspring of a god and a mortal humanoid who drew the god&rsquo;s eye. Godlings are not demigods&mdash;at least not yet&mdash;for their birth on the material plane prevents them from being classified as outsiders. Initially bound to the dust and earth of their birthplace, godlings are nonetheless more than mere mortals. They have inherited divine powers that, with time and experience, grow and allow godlings to rise and become powerful and famous heroes. (Of course there are many other possible origins of godlings&mdash;see Godlings in Your Campaign at the end of the product.)<br/><br/>Godlings are blessed (or cursed) with lives of adventure. They are thrust into dangerous quests and major events at a young age and often spend their entire adult lives moving from crisis to crisis, sought out by those who need their help, and hunted by those who wish them harm for no reason other than to spite their godly parents. Many godlings are made aware of their inherent power early in life, and are taught to respect both its origins and the responsibility it conveys. Others have no idea why they are able to perform feats that other mortals cannot, and may think themselves to be freaks or monsters (or some odd kind of sorcerer).<br/><br/>Godling Base Class:<br/>The godling base class is for characters that begin play with their deific heritage a known and active part of their lives. These characters know they are scions of the gods and are out to prove themselves worthy heirs by engaging in adventures in the mortal world. The godling base class actually contains two subclasses&mdash;clever and mighty godlings. These options are treated as different iterations of the same class, so a character cannot multiclass as two different kinds of godling.<br/><br/>Godling Prestige Class:<br/>Not all godlings realize who and want they are at the beginning of their adventuring careers. Indeed, some receive no special powers until their divine parents acknowledge their relationship.

Even the godlings themselves have an uneasy relationship with their own powers&mdash;some finding their earthly bodies barely up to the task of containing so much raw energy.<br/><br/>This book presents two new godling base classes, mystical counterparts to the ones from the previous book. It also contains a collection of godling spells&mdash;magic so tightly bound to the gods that only those with divine blood can wield it. In addition, there are also new godling feats, divine traits, and scion talents that can be used with these classes or the previously published mighty and clever godlings.<br/><br/>The Genius Guide to Mystic Godlings stands on its own, containing everything you need to create semi-divine spellcasting heroes for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.

Most are champions of a religious order, using their faith to gird them against the plots of heretics, infidels, and pagans. Others are devoted to a specific holy duty, perhaps one that has been entrusted to their family for generations. Although clerics are servants of their gods and paladins, in different lands they might be called bannerets, champions, gallants, kirks, or warders.<br/><br/>Although different templars express their powers of faith in different ways, they all share the ability to drive themselves further because of this faith. Some of the powers they gain through their unflinching faith are extensions of their normal talents, while others are mystic powers not unlike the divine gifts of clerics and paladins.<br/><br/>The personality and training of a templar is influenced by the dogma to which he subscribes. Those who ascribe to a religion with requirements for charity, chastity, and truthfulness might seem saintlike, while those who worship a care-free earth mother might appear far less chaste and knightlike. Templars conform closely to their faith&rsquo;s ideal, making them stereotypical examples of their culture. Some make no effort for such conformity, however, becoming brooders who do their duty grimly, even when in service to gods of love and joy. Often templars of this kind see themselves as buffers who do the unpleasant tasks required by their position so others need not take on such burdens.<br/><br/>Templars do well as primary front-line melee combatants. Although they lack the rage of barbarians or the broad range of combat skills of fighters, templars&rsquo; powers of conviction compensate well for these lacks. They can function anywhere a fighter could, and might aid party members in ways a fighter cannot. A templar traveling with a cleric of the same faith might well see himself as the cleric&rsquo;s guardian, though templars of warrior gods are just as likely to stand aside in combat, to allow the cleric to prove worthiness of their martial deities&rsquo; respect.<br/><br/>Templar vs. Paladin<br/><br/>So, what&rsquo;s the difference between a templar and a paladin? It&rsquo;s twofold, and the first is easy to explain. Although a paladin is an exemplar of the forces of good and law, a templar is an agent of divine will closer in scope and concept to a cleric. Any god can have templars, and chaotic good, true neutral, and even lawful evil templars are just as common (possibly even more so) as lawful good examples of the class. The grim warlord who conquers cities for the god of war, the battlefield hospitaller who escorts healers for the god of healing, and the insane pyromaniac determined to burn the world for the god of madness and fire are all examples of templars, though none could possibly qualify as paladins.<br/><br/>That naturally leads to asking what the crucial difference between a paladin and a lawful good templar is, which touches on the second major difference between the two classes. Put simply, templars are not held to the same standards as paladins, by either their order or their gods. Paladins must follow a strict code of conduct. This code is not just a requirement of their order, it&rsquo;s a crucial part of how they gain their power. No matter how reasonable or forgivable a paladin&rsquo;s violation of this code might be, it results in a loss of divine power until the paladin atones. If a paladin uses poison to destroy a great evil, even if no other option seemed to exist and the evil had to be destroyed, that paladin loses her divine powers until she atones. A paladin is not even required to worship a god (or similar philosophic concept) as a cleric is. It seems reasonable then to say that it&rsquo;s not a god that gives a paladin her power, it&rsquo;s the dedication to order and righteousness required of a paladin, and this is why there is no such thing as paladins of other alignments. Only a lawful good character can remain so purely dedicated to a specific set of rules as to gain supernatural power from doing so.<br/><br/>"}, "109424": {"rpgartist": ["Jenny Poussin"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "The Time Thief", "rpgdesigner": ["Owen K.C.

Even in a game where players with modern day sensibilities are asked to put themselves in the roles of medieval characters and process the mechanics of magic, psionics, and infinite planes of reality, it seems beyond the pale to ask them to un-know certain sets of experiences simply because time travel has caused them to cease to exist, and to keep track of what is and isn't true when jumping back and forth between timestreams and potential realities.<br/><br/>Yet, there's a reason that chronomancy is one of the topics that fans most often request supplements for.

Time has been called the 4th dimension, nature's way of making sure everything doesn't happen all at once, and a philosophical construct to allow for the comparison of durations. Philosophers grant time the power to heal all wounds, but also warn it is the death of all things from mountains, to kings, to peasants. We do not need to understand time to make use of it, but no matter how much we deny its power, we remain beholden to it.<br/><br/>Time is one of the great forces of the universe. But what if time doesn't just happen? What if time is fragile, or at least mutable, and must be guarded?<br/><br/>The time warden is a master of chronothurgy, the magic of manipulating time, and a self-appointed guardian of the timeline&mdash;the sequence of events from the beginning up to the present, and stretching out to the end. With the ability to manipulate time comes the ability to abuse it, and, if damaged, time can become dangerous. Time wardens are aware that if time is stretched too far, ignored too much, or called upon too recklessly, the result can be an injury to time. The measure of how likely a given use of time is to cause damage is known as chronal dissonance, and time wardens seek such dissonance and do their best to reduce it.<br/><br/>Of course, time wardens do far more than place a stitch in time. They are spellcasters, calling on temporal spells as sorcerers call on the arcane and clerics on the divine. Through manipulation of chronothurgy, a time warden can divine the future, heal his allies, undo many harmful effects, and eventually carry friends through time. Much like the bard or monk, the role of the time warden is less well defined than classes that stick closer to the cleric/fighter/rogue/wizard mold, but by the same token is less likely to overlap with existing characters filling those traditional roles. Certainly a time warden can be of great benefit to a band of adventurers, granting time-based benefits and hampering foes, if not through direct damage.<br/><br/>"}, "109427": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph J.

However, in most campaigns there is nothing a wizard can do that a sorcerer cannot. The wizard does gain considerable versatility, in the form of an unlimited number of spells known, but as a practical matter a wizard can only cast spells he thinks to prepare in advance, and the most useful spells (those a wizard is most likely to prepare) are also those a sorcerer is most likely to select as spells known.<br/><br/>The Advanced Players Guide actually amplified this conceptual problem somewhat, for while it provided new options for wizards, it also created two whole new arcane classes&mdash;the alchemist and the witch &ndash; both of which have considerable powers a wizard cannot duplicate.

In many ways the gunslinger is a natural evolution of the heroes of older eras, a direct outgrowth of the black knight, highwayman, and wandering martial artist.<br/><br/>To expand on the range of gunslinger options we provide 19 new deeds ranging from 1st to 19th level, and 14 new grit feats, allowing gunslingers to become more versatile, customizable characters. A selection of new gunslinger gear is also provided, including new alchemical cartridges and bandoliers.<br/><br/>To make grit itself more flexible we also provide a wide range of new options for alternate uses of grit, including applying deeds to different categories of weapons, and alternate forms of grit such as guile and panache. An alternate gunslinger class, the fusilier, is provided to show how these rules work in practice, and to give an option for having dashing Three Musketeers-type characters with less explicit Old West flavor. This allows the grit rules, deeds, and magic items from Ultimate Combat become a more useful part of a wider range of campaign styles, including games with no firearms at all.<br/><br/>"}, "109433": {"rpgdesigner": ["S.

Each volume in this line presents a small set of monsters tied to a single theme, but spread over a range of CRs. For the Kingdom of Graves, that theme is undead with a place at court. Rather than a random collection of tomb-dusters, author Sam Hing has put together an awesome set of cold ones that tie into twisted versions of the common fantasy kingdom. We have lords, knights, maidens-in-waiting, couriers, and even siege engines, all from the black courts of the dead.<br/><br/>This collection can be helpful to GMs in many different ways. Since the foes within range from CR 3 to CR 15, they can simply be used to augment the ranks of any undead encounter with something the players haven't seen before. However, they can also form the frame for a whole new threat should the GM decide to create a literal kingdom of graves. Whether it's a single castle that suffered some horrid deathless fate, a land that toils under undead horrors that openly rule mortal subjects, or a more subtle threat where a few undead lords have begun to infiltrate the lands of the living, the kingdom of graves can provide an ongoing problem for a group of PCs. Augmented with zombie soldiers, ghoul squires, and wight generals, the monsters provided here can form the backbone of an entire campaign arc, if a GM chooses to employ them in such a manner.<br/><br/>However you choose to terrorize your players, we're hopeful you'll find something useful in our second Mythic Menagerie.

For Rise of the Goblinoids, that theme is goblins and all the strange things descended from one of the most prolific of monstrous species. In addition to goblins who have taken to the trees, or who patrol the oceans, we have goblinoids that have mixed with genies, demons, and the forces of nature.<br/><br/>This collection can be helpful to GMs in many different ways. Goblins form the backbone of many of a campaign&rsquo;s early adventures, but after a CR 2 bugbear is no longer a threat (or at least after 12 of them aren&rsquo;t), most groups move on to dragons and giants, leaving goblinoids behind. Not only is this unfortunate from a stylistic point of view, it&rsquo;s annoying for rangers who take humanoid (goblinoid) as a favored enemy, wizards who craft goblin-bane weapons, and any character who has a hatred of goblins as part of a character background. With the goblinoids in this book, a GM can extend the goblin-bashing phase of a game well into the upper levels.<br/><br/>Additionally, the book can help create a campaign arc: a literal rise of the goblinoids. Perhaps many of the new races presented here are being seen for the first time, and their evils big and small are now spreading across the known world. Why are oni in goblin forms banding together? What has driven hidden goblin subraces out of their islands, forests, and underground caves?

Each volume in this line presents a small set of monsters tied to a single theme, but spread over a range of CRs. For Oceans of Blood, the theme is threats of the sea, with an emphasis on monsters that bite, tear, and rend. Author Sam Hing has created aquatic adversaries ranging from the mindless CR 1 harpoon weed and razor shoal to the incomprehensible CR 14 anemone behemoth, with enough surprises in-between to spice up seaborne adventures of any level.<br/><br/>Oceangoing adventures have a long and famous history in adventure stories, from the Greek legends of the Odyssey or Jason and the Argonauts to the modern terrors of Poseidon Adventure and Jaws. Adventures at sea are often rife with exploration and horror, likely because the sea was the best known &quot;final frontier&quot; for centuries, representing a place in which you could get lost easily, find new things, or get killed just for visiting. We are creatures of the land, and the threats of the sea are always going to be a little stranger, and thus more frightening because of that.<br/><br/>GMs can find it difficult to simulate that fear in a roleplaying game setting where fireballs are common and raise dead is an option (although reading and enforcing the rules for stealth and detection underwater as well as underwater combat in Chapter 13: The Environment of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook is a good start). This is especially true for experienced players, who can identify an aboleth from a single vague sentence and quote the differences between merfolk and sahuagin by heart. So more than any environment, the untold depths of the vast oceans are begging to be inhabited by new, strange, and (for player and character alike) previously unknown threats that can get fear flowing once more. And that's enough to make any GM smile.<br/><br/>We're confident that you'll find something useful in this, our sixth Mythic Menagerie. We have chummed the pages to draw out the nastiest of swimming slayers, and they're ready to make your players afraid to go back to the beach.

Initially Grecian wind spirits created to punish the wicked, harpies had their myth slowly evolve into the female bird creatures that have plagued heroes in countless roleplaying games.

But each time the proud and self-conscious Garetier, the stubborn, Kosher allied with the dwarves, the chivalrous praiotic Griffinforder and the as Travia believing as scheming Darpatier can preserve their peculiarities and rise from the dust of history. And so historic and adventure-prone locations and regional pride shape the land of proud castles. This richly decorated box is concerned with the imperial city of Gareth, the largest city on the continent, in whose dark alleys poverty and wealth, splendor and misery create a dangerous mix with the nobles of the kingdom and their intrigues, history and geography of the core provinces Garetien, Kosch, Darpatien and Griffinsford, the life and culture in these lands, the structure and organization of the Middenrealm, and much more.<br/><br/>"}, "109445": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Papyrus (Issue 13 - Holiday 1993)", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark Arsenault", "John Fraser", "T.

The player does not control each individual team member directly. Instead, he designs plays and acquires players from other teams in order to make the perfect team. Kevin Keegan was one of the more popular football managers during the 1990s. The graphics were considered minimalist in contrast to games released in North America and that is why the game was never released there.<br/><br/>Unlike the majority of football management sims, both of the time and today, Kevin Keegan's Player Manager gave the player the option of having direct control of your team on the pitch like a regular football sim (but only if your own personal character was still within playing age and currently representing your team on the pitch), as well as doing all the managerial side of the gameplay as in regular football management sims. The actual on the pitch gameplay was made using the Kick Off 2 engine developed by Dino Dini. You were the player-coach, and you begin the game as a 28-year-old. When you become 35 years old at the end of the 2000 season you automatically declare your retirement and it becomes impossible to control the players during a match from that point onwards. It would also be impossible to control the players if he missed a game to injury or being put in reserves. After a few more seasons, however you could sign his nephew or other family member and you are then again able to control the players on the pitch again. There were only forty-eight teams in a three division structure, and the top tier was titled 'Division 1' as this was before the days of the Premier League. It also featured the FA Cup (titled the Misawa Cup), and Football League Cup (titled Premier Cup) competitions.<br/><br/>The game has features which are evident in today's football management games, like training, scouting and newspaper reports. Other football sim conventions which may have began with Kevin Keegan's Player Manager include colour associated positions. It is common in football sims for Goalkeepers to be green, Defenders blue and Strikers being red. Player Manager is believed to be the first game to employ this colour code, although it also had colours such as Sky blue for Sweepers, Black for midfielders (now commonly yellow), Yellow for Wingers and White for Utility players.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kevin Keegan's Player Manager&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "109486": {"poll": [], "name": "Kid Klown in Crazy Chase", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Game Boy Advance edition", "English/European SNES edition", "Japanese Super Famicom edition", "North American Game Boy Advance edition", "North American SNES edition"], "average": "6.25", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Kemco"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance", "SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Kemco"], "description": "Kid Klown in Crazy Chase (\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u306e\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30b8\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9) features the Kid Klown, the player character who must rescue the Princess Honey from the villain Dirty Joe.

Even witches and bards are normally presented as drawing on power that originates outside them (from a patron or the power of music, respectively), rather than having power grow from within them. Only sorcerers are commonly presented as having truly innate magic powers which are the legacy of a mystic heritage or special destiny.<br/><br/>The strongest indications of this legacy are the powers granted by a sorcerer&rsquo;s bloodline. Each bloodline affects a sorcerer&rsquo;s spells known, class skills, potential training (in the form of bonus feats), special powers, and even how the sorcerer casts spells (as modified by bloodline arcana). Bloodlines are an awesome, flexible, flavorful element of the sorcerer class. As a result, nearly all efforts to create new rule variants for sorcerers do so by creating new sorcerous bloodlines.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s fine, as far as it goes. But is that the only way to make sorcerers different? Should these heroes who have magic itself coursing through their veins not have access to any special abilities beyond what their heritage powers grant them? Why can&rsquo;t sorcerers learn to use their innate spells in whole new ways, develop weird quirks of magic power, or have alternate class abilities similar to the archetypes of other classes? In short, why can&rsquo;t a sorcerer&rsquo;s options go beyond bloodlines?<br/><br/>Sorcerer&rsquo;s Options: Beyond Bloodlines is designed to expand the alternate rules that can be used to make two sorcerers different, even if they select the same bloodline.

As a master trader, his career has a long and colorful history, much of which should not be repeated in polite company. Kragnar first came to prominence when he began a line of used chariot yards (the merchandise for which is detailed in The Genius Guide to Loot 4 Less Volume 7: Krazy Kragnar&rsquo;s Used Chariots). When angry dwarves shut down that operation, he turned to a new business plan with Krazy Kragnar&rsquo;s Surplus Alchemy Shop. When that entirely legitimate business burned to the ground (and the local human guards and fire wardens made no effort to save it), canny Kragnar turned back to his roots and began working in semilegal magic items at a Goblin Market (as detailed in Krazy Kragnar&rsquo;s Black Market Magic Items).<br/><br/>In the course of running a successful shop in a Goblin Market, Kragnar was regularly dealing with cheats, thieves, adventurers, and insane folk in almost equal measure. One of the more common insane people was Garious the Grogomancer, a failed wizard who had fallen on extremely hard times. Once a true master of arcane arts, Garious had been kicked out of the prestigious Meiramazal Academy Arcane for creating an explosion during a demonstration of a new way to make magic staves. Having fallen to the bottom of the social ladder, he lurked in the Goblin Market of Refuge, offering (and sometimes succeeding) to cast spells for wine, to extend his days-long binges of inebriation.<br/><br/>No one, Kragnar included, took Garious seriously. When the &ldquo;Grogomancer&rdquo; came to the merchant goblin&mdash;claiming to have recreated his alternate magic creation ritual, and in the process made a &ldquo;tige vierge&rdquo; (a magic staff that could have any spell impressed upon it and then recast)&mdash;Kragnar was certain it was part of a complex con game. But a good con game can be an asset as well so Kragnar allowed Garious to demonstrate. When the demonstration went well, and Kragnar could find no sign of deceit, the goblin had Garious set up a shop to make another tige vierge under supervision. When that worked, Kragnar set up a new shop. Well outside the slums surrounding the Goblin Market, Krazy Kragnar&rsquo;s Magic Staff Emporium offers a wide range of &ldquo;stock&rdquo; magic staves, as well as custom orders returned in half the time of any competitor. Unlike previous shops owned or run by Kragnar, the Magic Staff Emporium is a high-end establishment that caters to high-end clients. In selling only magic staves it keeps its client list exclusive, but in doing so quickly it attracts dwarf gesith mages from the far-off Rune Peaks, tormentor battle-cursers from Ankhara, secretive shadow-bedreven from the Cairnwood, and adventurous archmages of all stripes. The prices at the Magic Staff Emporium might be a little higher, but when you need a staff of healing by the end of the week, you&rsquo;re willing to pay a premium.<br/><br/>"}, "109490": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Papyrus (Issue 15 - Gencon 1994)", "rpgdesigner": ["Mark Arsenault", "Ken Auliffe", "Kathy Bayles", "T.

Kragnar set up a large shop and bought a house in the Silk District of the city of Refuge.<br/><br/>In return for going entirely legit, Kragnar got to watch the town guard do nothing as his Alchemy Shop went up in green flames after a patron carelessly tossed a still hot tindertwig into the half-off bin. The guard claimed the prismatic smoke pouring out of the windows was too dangerous to risk getting a bucket brigade near the flaming shop.

When the flames, peals of thunder, and random bursts of lightning and acid rain finally subsided around Kragnar&rsquo;s shop, the goblin was bankrupt and no longer welcome in the homes of wealthier patrons.<br/><br/>It was, thought Kragnar, a sign.<br/><br/>Turning to some old friends who didn't care about his current circumstances, Kragnar quickly began building a new financial empire. This one paid more attention to high profitability and customer demand, and less to the rules of tariffs, taxes, recorded transactions, and craft-guild rules. In short, Kragnar joined a Goblin Market and started selling black market magic items. And in a matter of months, the canny goblin was once more rolling in coin...<br/><br/>"}, "109492": {"rpgartist": ["V.

His previous business (detailed in Loot 4 Less, vol. 7: Krazy Kragnar&rsquo;s Used Chariots) was closed after a dwarven nobleman perished in a freak houda accident. Now Krazy Kragnar returns with a whole new business plan &mdash; he is the owner and chief salesman of the Alchemical Surplus Shop, a place that buys alchemist fire that&rsquo;s past its use - by date, thunderstones that don&rsquo;t meet military specifications, and refurbished tanglefoot bags in bulk and passes the savings on to the customer.<br/><br/>Of course, when dealing with alchemical materials that are left over from, rejected by, or bought at the estate sale of the previous owner, you often end up with some nonstandard merchandise. The Alchemical Surplus Shop would be happy to sell discounted acid flasks and sunrods if they were available, but such items are bought up long before Kragnar gets on the scene. Not to worry, though! Less popular items are usually passed over by merchants salvaging the smoking crater of a failed alchemical bazaar, and their loss is your gain! Kragnar has pulled together new items&mdash;from the cacophonous boompot to the subtle clocktinder&mdash;all available only here!<br/><br/>So come browse the shelves, flip through the seasonal catalog, and check out the daily specials. Krazy Kragnar has dozens of alchemical items you&rsquo;ve never even heard of, ready to arm adventurers with the power of almost-magic and challenge alchemists by offering new items for them to craft.<br/><br/>"}, "109493": {"rpgartist": ["Okan B\u00fclb\u00fcl", "Brett Carlos", "OtherWorld Creations", "Sade"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Red Tyrants of the Mountains", "rpgdesigner": ["Timothy Johnson", "Vlad Presnyak", "Rich Redman", "John Reyst"], "rpgproducer": ["Miranda Horner", "Anthony Kenniston", "Stan!", "Owen K.C.

They are what we think of when we read the word after the ampersand. They are icons of evil, and targets for greedy adventurers everywhere. Here, in the fourth Codex Draconis, we give you what you need to drop red dragons into your games with a minimum of effort and a maximum of options. We want to help you create red dragons that your players will remember for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>In this Codex Draconis, you&rsquo;ll find the options and alternatives for a dozen red dragons, just as you&rsquo;d expect. We cover every age category of the scarlet horrors of the mountains. Each age category also has three pregenerated treasure hoards, some alternative monster builds, and suggestions on how to build even deadlier dragon encounters. Along the way, we hope to share some surprises with you, too.<br/><br/>Dragons are among the most iconic, and most popular, of all fantasy roleplaying game foes. Once the domain exclusively of higher-level adventures, dragons now have rules for every stage of life. This means that wet-behind-the-ears PCs can face dragons early in their careers (though likely they will be facing dragons the size of housecats). To ensure a dragon is always just the right threat for PCs of any level, dragons are given twelve stages of life that, when combined with the many different types of dragons, creates a range of CRs from 2 to 22. The problem with that, of course, is that it requires a lot of stat blocks, and those take up room. To save space, instead of presenting a full write-up of every dragon at every age category, the game&rsquo;s creators present a set of rules outlining how to write up dragons, and then they give a few examples of each type. As a result, although you can find a dragon of the right CR for an encounter, it takes a considerable amount of work to get that dragon ready for the game.<br/><br/>To help with that problem, the fine folks at D20PFSRD.com took on the job of creating full stat blocks for every true dragon of every type, and when we expressed an interest in using those as the starting point for our Codex Draconis line, they were kind enough to give us their blessing.
