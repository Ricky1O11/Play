In 2040, Dr. Russel VanOrman Quine discovered that Spirits contain energy that can never be destroyed.  Even when used to power heavy machinery, this energy source (quintessence) dissipates into the ether, returning to its unknown source.  All we need to do is collect it.<br/><br/>You have just been hired by B.E.E.net to collect Bound Ethereal Energy Spirits (B.E.E.S.).  Seems simple?  Just find B.E.E.S. wandering around in any haunted manor and grab them with your VanOrman Machine aka &ldquo;H.I.V.E.&rdquo; (Held Intensity Vitality Extractor).  The main issue is a H.I.V.E. needs to be exactly Arrayed to grab a Spirit by joining Tubes to match it.   Of course there may be some side effects.   So... BEE careful.<br/><br/>Holding Spirits makes a H.I.V.E. rise in Pressure and Tubes may leak.   A failed Tube can lead to the unbinding of the Spirit and the Tubes must be trashed.  The Spirit is released back into the unknown perhaps to be rebound another day.<br/><br/>Also keep in mind that although Spirit collectors work together, you must all fill your quota each day or you may lose your jobs!  Alternatively, an especially good harvest may get your pictures on the wall at headquarters.<br/><br/>B.E.E.S. can be played cooperatively or competitively, and the cooperative game can be played with one player.  Your goal in the cooperative game is to collect a quota of Spirits and Quintessence, and your goal in the competitive game is to have the most Quintessence when the game ends.  To collect a Spirit and acquire its Quintessence, you must build an Array with Tube cards from your hand and pass both an Array test and a Pressure test.  When you collect a Spirit, it goes into your H.I.V.E. and affects you Pressure.  Players must manage their hand of Tubes and decide how to build their Array while balancing the board state when deciding which Spirit to target.  Gameplay is relatively simple, but the nuances in your decisions determine your level of risk vs. reward and can also greatly affect the other players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"287105": "First edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "B.E.E.S.", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "185505": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Mytheria", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"287106": "Web Browser Edition"}, "average": "6", "videogametheme": {"2404": "Card / Casino Games"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "description": "A sci-fi card game.

Slowly but steadily, the Moon has been approaching the Earth, touched the surface and ripped a deep rift across continents, mountain ranges and oceans, until it came to a halt in the now dried-out Pacific Ocean. Chaos and devastation wrecked the Earth and its inhabitants - and grew even more in dimension when the Moon revealed itself to be a &quot;kami&quot;, a Japanese God of old: the white dragon TSUKUYUMI. Exiled into the night sky eons ago, TSUKUYUMI has been roused by Japanese warriors, who tried to rid themselves off their godly creators. TSUKUYUMI'S time for revenge has finally come...<br/>Now, in the post-apocalyptic world, humankind is on the verge of extinction, whereas animal species mutated under the influence of TSUKUYUMI and grew bigger and stronger than ever. All those different factions are now fighting fiercely for survival, as well as for world domination.<br/><br/>TSUKUYUMI is a no-luck boardgame, that demands specific strategic skills of it's 3-5 (6) players. It's particular appeal lies in the clash of multifarious, asymmetrical factions. At the beginning, each player picks one of the five factions. The factions bring their own respective abilities, units and strategies. Therefore the game changes depending on what factions meet on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Values and abilities of the factions still don&rsquo;t guarantee victory. Numerous test matches have shown: It&rsquo;s the players who find new combinations and the right moments to use specific faction features, who notice their fellow players&rsquo; weaknesses and use them to their own advantages. This way, they shape their faction and bring the creatures and their stories to life.<br/><br/>FACTIONS<br/>THE NOMADS are the former soldiers who were stationed on the USS Nomad, an aircraft carrier that stranded in the wastelands. Armed, agile and patriotic as they are, the NOMADS try to claim the remains of the moon in the name of their (former) nation.<br/>THE BOARLORDS are a nation of strong and intelligent boars, who enter the pacific region from the former Korean peninsula. They aim to replace the human race as dominant species -claiming more and more land by terraforming it into their rampart-like homes. <br/>THE CYBERSAMURAI use satellites, supercomputers and artificial intelligence once developed in old Japan to control an army of drones, fighting bots and even an orbital laser system, threatening anyone who tries to plant their flag on the moon.<br/>THE DARK SEED'S nest grew in the wastelands as roaches and other insects became bigger and more intelligent under TSUKUYUMI'S influence. Their swarm grows rapidly - and thus they fight relentlessly to overwhelm adversarial units and territories by their sheer number.<br/>THE KAMPFGRUPPE 03 are the heirs to the Order of Marduk - and same as their spiritual ancestors in medieval times, dragonslayers Siegfried and Georg, they strive for a world unburdened by TSUKUYUMI'S existence.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Each faction has its own units, its own strengths and special abilities - therefore requiring a very adjusted strategy to win. <br/>After the gameboard is set up, every player chooses a faction respectively. The faction boards explain in detail all special abilities and how to use them. It also specifies the factions' start set-up.<br/>According to the decending initiative order marked on the board, the players install their &quot;Homezones&quot;, pick three start-areas and place their units.<br/>Prior to the first round, they also choose a white actioncard - a combination of actions they can use before the beginning of each round.<br/><br/>Then, the players gather their resources according to what their areas offer. They may use these resources to bid on the blue, green and red actioncards. Every phase is represented by six of those actioncards marked from A to F. Every card displays a different combination of the actions that can be taken during its respective phase. The highest bid is awarded with the A-card, the next one with the B-card, and so on.<br/><br/>Each round consists of the following phases:<br/>White Phase: Players use the white actioncard they chose to emphasise their strategy.<br/>Blue Phase: Players can rise in the initiative order and/or draw an Impact Card.<br/>Green Phase: New units are generated and resources collected.<br/>Red Phase: Units are moved, adversarial areas and units may be attacked. Onis are placed, moved, and used for attacks.<br/><br/>GOAL<br/>The player who gains the most Victory Points wins the game. Victory Points are earned by conquering and occupying areas, and by fulfilling goals and/or the faction's respective mission.<br/><br/>END<br/>The game ends after the number of rounds determined by the players beforehand - usually 3-4 rounds.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"287145": "First edition"}, "age": "14", "name": "TSUKUYUMI - Full Moon Down", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "average": "9.03571", "usersrated": "28", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "185539": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Matrix Pandemonium", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"287146": "Web Browser edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"28470": "Matrix"}, "videogametheme": {"2283": "Spy / Espionage"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2167": "Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Jump up and down floors of buildings, face off with evil agents, ghostly twins and vicious octo bots.

The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.

The moves are coordinated by a monitor who typically supervises a number of drivers transporting mutts along a fixed route. Most of these start early in the day and rely on drivers who typically drive about one hour, then meet the next driver. They let the dogs take a water and potty break, then load them up in the next car headed for the rescue.<br/><br/>In this game, players can take on the role of mutts (all dogs on a move are called mutts regardless of their breed) or movers (the drivers who are helping to take dogs to a forever home). The game can be played with or without a Control. While the normal role of the Control on a mutt move is to keep drivers informed of the schedule, in the game Control is the person who generates the non-player participants in the move, both mutts and movers, and breathes life into them.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to achieve your character goal, which for most players will be to arrive at the destination rescue with all the mutts still in good health. This is how it nearly always goes in real-life, but of course there has to be more drama in the game or it will lose a lot of tension and probably fun.<br/><br/>"}, "185736": {"boardgamedesigner": {"67576": {"name": "Matthias Kaufmann"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Lucky Cake", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2696085_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8398": {"name": "LOGIS"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2696085.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"287384": "English/German first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "3", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Lucky Cake is a children's game that features a cake.<br/><br/>"}, "185737": {"rpgitemversion": {"287385": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Serves You Right", "rpgproducer": {"22287": "Caroline Berg"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2737700.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"349": "History (Britain / Ireland)"}, "rpg": {"28478": "Serves You Right"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpgseries": {"28321": "2015 RPG Geek 24 Hour RPGs"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2737700_t.png", "description": "The murder doesn't matter - the blackmail does.<br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/><br/>The Blackmoor-Winters family has been murdered!

Younger readers are also able to play, as the game is very educational for teaching sentence structure and increasing vocabulary, while being fun at the same time!<br/><br/>The players represent retired super heroes and reformed super villains who have gotten together, years later, to reminisce about their earlier adventures.  But, as always happens at occasions like this, each is trying to outdo their peers by bragging about an even more amazing story of what they once did.  But the really funny part is that everyone's memories are faulty because they are now going senile, and they're relying on their &quot;friends&quot; to help them fill in the blanks!  So while the hero or villain might really have a great story to tell, what comes out of their mouth ends up being VERY different.  Each player has two goals - 1) To be the best at helping the other players in remembering correctly, and 2) To come up with your own memory/adventure that your peers agree is the best one of all!<br/><br/>Remember When ... comes with hundreds of unique cards, each with 4 words/phrases on it's 4 sides.  There are ZERO repeats, meaning there are over a billion billion different combinations!  There are also several blank cards for players to create their own.  On the Active Player's turn they are creating a memory with 7 or 8 (if using the optional Orange cards) different cards representing a different part of the memory.  1) WHEN they did this, 2) WHERE they did this, 3) HOW they did this (i.e. Adverb), 4) The ACTION that they took (i.e. Verb), 5) The DESCRIPTION of the object of their memory (i.e. Adjective), 6) The OBJECT of their memory (i.e. Noun), and 7) WHY they took this action.  For example, &quot;Remember When ..., while looking for my other sock, in the crowded grocery store, I repeatedly kissed the furry caveman because the Great Conjunction was at hand!?&quot;<br/><br/>But the Active Player does not create this Sentence/Memory from their own cards.  The other players are rapidly trying to assist the Active Player by submitting one card each.  The Object and the Action Taken are determined first and read out loud, so the players have some context for their card submissions.  Once one card of a type/color (i.e. &quot;Blue&quot;) has been submitted then another available color must be submitted.

The Game begins shortly after Charles IV of France dies in 1328. The Queen of England, Isabella of France, is unable to claim the French throne for herself, and has claimed it for her son, Edward III. France rejects the claim, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right that she did not possess. The Player represents the House of Plantagenet with the ambition of attaining control of France. As the Commander of English Forces, you must control a significant number of French Cities and Towns before the last Campaign Card is played.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the English Forces. The Player&rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to control at least 10 French Cities and 12 French Towns before the last Campaign Card is Played. If the French control London and Portsmouth at the end of their Turn, the French win. If the last Campaign Card was played and Player does not control 10 Cities and 12 Towns, France Wins.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES: NO KING OF ENGLAND features lots of colorful game counters of various Combat Units including Nobles, Knights, Archers, Handgunners and Cannon. English Nobles will gather their Forces and move on the Map in a strategic manner along rout lines of key settlements (and Naval Lanes). Combat is resolved in a tactical manner that includes individual combat between Champion Knights and Archers.

The Guild selected determines which Techniques a character will have for use during combat.  Advanced Techniques use a fairly simple tree structure for access.

It is highly cosmopolitan, with Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Jews being the main peoples here.<br/>    Monsters and magic are real. Monsters are similar to those from myths and legends, though not all the stories are literally true. Magic is subtle rather than flashy.<br/>    Most people believe in monsters and magic, though they have seldom if ever witnessed either, and dismiss the majority of the stories as nonsense. They are correct in this, but do not realise the extent of the supernatural world.<br/>    The main gods worshipped here are typically Egyptian (Isis being the main example), a syncretic combination of Greek and Egyptian (the chief being Serapis), or Roman. People are increasingly seeing the older gods as facets of the Roman gods, but the priesthoods of Serapis and Isis resist this idea.<br/>    The Musaeum of Alexandria is a great source of scholarship, with a vast library, but isn&rsquo;t what it was in pre-Roman times.<br/><br/><br/>You belong to an organisation known as the Venatores, meaning Hunters.<br/><br/>    Your job is to hunt down supernatural threats to the city.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Fortune System<br/><br/>The game uses the Fortune System, a light version of the Fate rules , influenced by the Jadepunk RPG.

The rules present a series of tiered difficulties .<br/><br/>Characters have &quot;Statistics&quot; (Coordination, Discipline, Endurance, Logic, Perception, Reflexes, Strength, and Talent) which are generated with d100, adding 40 to results that are under 41.

The islands are ringed with coral and clad in jungle, except where the people have cleared them to grow rice. The flora and fauna are generally like those of south-east Asia, though there are some introduced species (especially crops) and fantasy bring-ins.<br/><br/>The people of Gehennum are small, lithe, and brown-skinned. They have a sophisticated culture and technology, at least as advanced in every respect as the classical Mediterranean (Greeks and Romans), and in some areas (such as optics and chemistry) considerably better.<br/><br/>One important respect in which the Gehennese suffer by comparison with default fantasy cultures is that (there being no extensive grasslands on their world) there are no horses or equivalent riding animals. The very wealthy ride elephants, but on the whole heavily-armoured burgher infantry (not aristocratic cavalry) dominate Gehennese battlefields, politics, and society.<br/><br/>Another, less important, is that metals are relatively scarce. The Gehennese (and other peoples of the World of Isles) use glass, obsidian, bone, shell, and flint for cheap cutting edges.

The other players try to recover all of the critical data before security shuts the whole system down.<br/><br/>In both modes gameplay proceeds in turns. During a player's turn he will move his pawn from one tile to another (which represents accessing different computer systems) across connection points, revealing facedown tiles in the process. Each revealed tile will indicate how many data tokens are to be placed on the tile facedown. A player on that tile can choose to take the data tokens which each indicate a value on their face which is kept hidden from the other players. Collected data tokens can be saved by a player by returning to his start tile. A player can also leave firewall and virus tokens on a tile which will slow other players down. In addition to finding data on revealed tiles, players can also find antivirus tokens and firewall access tokens which will allow them to move to a tile containing a virus or firewall. If two players' pawns are on the same tile one of them may initiate a hack attack, which involves rolling dice. The victor may steal a data token from the loser.<br/><br/>The game continues for 11-15 rounds after which the player who has saved the most data is the winner (in &quot;Training Operation&quot; mode).<br/><br/>In &quot;Special Operation&quot; mode the rogue agent must prevent the other agents from retrieving all of the data tokens before time runs out.<br/><br/>"}, "185861": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Magneto", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"287570": "Web Browser Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2351": "Puzzle"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Addictive game in which you have to move the magnetic ball to the exit of each level using your arrow keys.

This technology allows them to witness other worlds and dimensions for study without leaving the safety of the lab. This window views the subject and allows for observations to be made about the alien flora or fauna being studied without the subject being aware of being observed.<br/><br/>Initial tests were made with life indigenous to the planet. This kind of data could be obtained with a time delay via satellites. However the device could be used to observe the same information except in real time.<br/><br/>Studying alien worlds followed with similar positive results as the scientists studied planets throughout the galaxy. One effect that was seen was that the view became increasingly hazy the more light years away the targeted planet was from their world. Like viewing from a real world window, the farther the subject was in distance, the harder it became to discern details.<br/><br/>Now the biophysicists have set their sights on viewing another dimension. The initial tests have seen strange results compared to the other tests. The view seen is nearly opaque with the only movement seen as grey clouds moving in almost utter darkness. The scientists theorize this may be due to distance between dimensions being greater than anything in our universe. But something has been observing the scientists back. The next time the scientists open the window to look at the dimension, a thick grey mist diffuses through a gateway and starts killing the scientists by asphyxiating them. Security protocols are triggered and the group as military or corporate security is sent inside to deal with this bizarre gaseous monster from another realm.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the entire building is soon filled with gas as the grey mist diffuses throughout and then starts pouring out into the surrounding town through gaps in doorways or open windows. The group may be inside the town as this mist roils through and suffocates those who try to breathe inside the mist.

They live forever in the stories people have told each other from generation to generation, enchanting children and adults alike..<br/><br/>This is not who you are.<br/><br/>You are the ones who were discarded, the ones who have no songs or stories, the ones who slipped out of humanity's collective memory. You don't even get to be the great villains or beasts the heroes defeat, or the mentors or lesser characters who help them on their way to greatness. You were left behind.<br/><br/>Left behind in the Silence, the Forgotten Land, the Unremembrance. Your home has many names, none of them important because who would speak of it save you who are already there, and what need have you to speak of a place you cannot leave?<br/><br/>There is little to speak of even should you want to. The sky is eternally overcast, no sun or moon or stars to divide the eternal gloom into days and nights. Most of it is wrapped in the thick fog that rises from the oily sea and shadowy bogs, and the few crumbling mountain peaks that rise above it are swept by a keening wind that cuts through cloth and thoughts alike. Everything is murky, grey, and rotting.<br/><br/>Everything apart from the Pit. In a place of gloomy half-light it is the only perfect darkness, a spiral of worn, water-slick stairs going down into the black depths. It's the only permanent landmark here, where everything else shifts and slides when nobody looks, where the landscape forgets its own form from one minute to the next.<br/><br/>It's where everyone goes when they can no longer stand the grey, when the cutting winds around the peaks is no longer enough to empty their minds of sadness. Down they go, some slipping on the treacherous steps to fall silently into the darkness, some disappearing into the shadows still on their feet. Many go alone, but sometimes one leaving will pull others with them, like a flock of birds flying south as winter comes, together circling the echoing darkness until they are all lost from sight.<br/><br/>Now your time has come. You have lost the will to stay among the weak and tired, your own weaknesses and exhaustion carrying you here, to the edge of the Pit. Perhaps you look around in a last farewell to a place you can no longer stand, perhaps you take that first step without looking back. Soon enough it is all the same; soon enough all memories of the Grey Land fades and all you can see is the cracked, damp stone of the next step before you, each one deeper in shadow than the last. Maybe someone is following you, or maybe you are following them.

This year you're heading to Golden Oaks, the ritzy neighborhood where the real treats await! No more rock hard Mary Janes or stale candy corn for you! Those bronze door knockers in Golden Oaks will bring you a real haul. King sized candy bars, giant battery operated lollipops, silver dollars, and more! All that remains now is to don your costume and meet your friends on the road to the sugary paradise of Golden Oaks.<br/><br/>Only, there's a couple small snags. All the big kids are out tonight too, and they'd rather steal candy than get it on their own. Then there's getting to Golden Oaks.<br/><br/>Sure, you could follow Drewry Lane out past the high school and enter Golden Oaks from the east side, but that would take hours of walking and you don't have hours to waste with so many houses to hit, so many treats to claim. That means taking a shortcut. That means going through Old Man Fedwicks Farm. People, kids mostly, say the old man is off his rocker. There's all kinds of stories about what he's done to kids who got caught on his property. That isn't going to stop you though. You've got your friends and there's safety in numbers.

It's set in a world of faeries and boglins, and borrows heavily from European folklore, Celtic fairy tales in particular.<br/><br/>The players have memories of a previous life, when they were brave heroes who stopped a war between man and faerie, and then vanished. Now that there are signs of a new invasion, they are called upon to be heroes in this life. During their travels to the Otherworld, the realm of the fae, they will remember more and more of their previous heroic life, and grow more powerful. Or they might die.<br/><br/>Death is not the end, however. In the Otherworld, the players' spirits have no problem finding a new body, similar to the old one. But dying is not without a cost. The more the players reincarnate, the more they lose their humanity and the more fae-like they become. When they reach the faerie court, will they remember enough of their human past to save their kin?<br/><br/>Once We Were Heroes: The Summer Children gives an outline for a story, but you'll never play the same game twice. It uses only a few d6, and you won't ever have to sum dice or modifiers; you can see the result of a die roll at a glance. Shared narrative control is built into the game. Combat is fast, simple and deadly. Players have the tools and abilities to overcome challenges in many different ways (without fear of failure or death) and the GM doesn't have to pull punches.<br/><br/>"}, "185947": {"rpg": {"28545": "MASTER PLAN"}, "poll": {}, "name": "MASTER PLAN", "rpgproducer": {"64549": "M.

For opposed actions (including Combat), the Difficulty Value will be the opponents modified 2d6.  The system supposes win, lose, or tie.  Double 1s always indicate failure and double 6s always indicate success, regardless of Difficulty Value.<br/><br/>Players control a Ghost as a character.  Ghosts begin with a narrative concept.  Ghosts have a limited number of Emotions (they have no body and no mind--only memories and emotions).  Emotions may be actual emotions (rage), states of mind (agitated), ways of thinking (analytical), philosophies (Stoicism), or worldviews (bigoted).  The player and GM must agree on these Emotions.  Players distribute 12 Emotion Points among their Emotions to purchase Ranks.  Ghosts also have four derived abilities--Intensity, Will, Vitality, and Integrity.  Ghost have one or more Drives and one or more Stimuli--these motivate the Ghost.  Finally, a Ghost will have an Ego and an Id, both narrative elements.<br/><br/>While the game is mechanically simple it is conceptually quite complex and subtle.  Ghosts have memories but no mind, and Emotions but no motivations.  They are driven by Stimuli and Drives but these are invariant personality components.  Ghosts will interact with the world (or attempt to) in ways that they remember as being familiar, even if these attempts are not particularly successful.<br/><br/>"}, "185963": {"rpg": {"17848": "First Issues!"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Hotwire", "rpgproducer": {"40671": "James Mullen"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2700232.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"287705": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2700232_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This is a new collectible RPG in a Golden Age Superheroes vein: to play, you just need any set of the playbooks, with at least one per player.
