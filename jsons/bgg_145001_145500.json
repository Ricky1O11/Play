During the game, mine owners walk the fine line between profit and safety, payroll, graft, and layoffs which can cause worker discontent to rise to the point that a union is formed. If the union comes to their mine, mine owners must negotiate with their workers to continue operations.

The lead player plays a single card, then each other player must follow suit, if possible &ndash; except that a player can always choose to play a Magician. A Magician is a null card that can never win a trick (unless a trick consists only of Magicians).

The Witch of Hearts doubles points earned from hearts up to a maximum of 15 points, while the Witch of Diamonds knocks up to 5 points off your score. If a player &quot;shoots the moon&quot; by collecting all the hearts and either the Witch or Queen of Spades (or both), that player scores no points while everyone else scores 20, 25 or 30 points.<br/><br/>Players continue playing rounds until one player reaches 70 points, at which time the player with the lowest score wins.

R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It's not a strict parody, in that it neither includes everything from the books nor has everything in the same order. Instead, throughout the campaign you'll find numerous nods to Tolkien's work, ranging from the obvious (the Nazghouls) to the obscure (La Torre de M&aacute;gica). My concern was, first and foremost, to make quality missions, and only then to bend them to Tolkien as much as possible.<br/><br/>The six missions contained herein are meant to be played in the order given, but not back-to-back. They span the first four books of Orpheus, giving the Storyteller the chance to develop things as she will while letting the characters slowly come to a realization of the true danger of the Ashtray (at which point they will be almost totally unable to give it up. Don't you just love being evil? =). That said, feel free to alter the campaign as you wish. There are no e-demons in the .zip file to make sure you keep everything the way it is. (At least, none that you know of =).<br/><br/>Here is the list of files constituting the entire Lord of the Ashtray campaign, along with a brief description of their contents (for convenience, I've left off all the &quot;LotA&quot; prefixes):<br/><br/>     Introduction - This file, including the epic Samarillion.<br/>     Mission 1 - Orpheus sends the crucible to buy the Ashtray off a local hue.<br/>     Mission 2 - The crucible must recover the Ashtray from Orpheus' ruins.<br/>     Mission 3 - Local spooks are disappearing around the Tower of Romia hotel, and the crucible decides to investigate.<br/>     Mission 4 - The Nazghouls steal the Ashtray to build their hive.<br/>     Mission 5 - A psychic reveals much of the Ashtray's true nature, for a price.<br/>     Mission 6 - Lazarus Redux sends the crucible to investigate a steel foundry, with instructions to destroy the Ashtray before it destroys them.<br/>     Sam Haight Ashtray - A description of the actual Ashtray artifact, patterned after the artifacts in Crusade of Ashes.<br/>     Spectres - A description of all Spectres unique to The Lord of the Ashtray, including breeds, sample Spectres, and Horror descriptions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As you might have gathered from the descriptions, the missions happen at different points in the metaplot. Mission 1 occurs during the time of Orpheus. Missions 2 and 3 come during Crusade of Ashes, 4 and 5 during Shades of Gray, and 6 during Shadow Games. This means there are spoilers, so be careful what you read if you don't have the books yet. And like I said, you can alter the chronology as you want to fit your campaign. Simply by dropping Mission 2, for example, the entire campaign can happen during Orpheus' heyday.<br/><br/>So there you have it. Good luck with the campaign, and happy haunting!<br/><br/>"}, "145009": {"rpg": {"9041": "Mutants & Masterminds (3rd Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hoodoo Mama", "rpgproducer": {"5875": "Jon Leitheusser"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1714189.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"213882": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"9877": "Wild Cards"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"22182": "Wild Cards SCARE Sheet"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1714189_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Hoodoo Mama<br/><br/>They say the dead walk in the bayous of New Orleans, and that everything that happens in the city gets seen&mdash;through the eyes of dead pigeons and rats&mdash;and gets told to the city&rsquo;s mysterious protector, Hoodoo Mama.

Become a character from 1001 Arabian Nights and build graceful minarets, dazzling gates and soaring cupolas to draw the eye of the sultan and carve your name in history. Players will carefully select the best building tiles to erect the most impressive structures, scoring points for following patterns and fulfilling secret objectives. Earn sapphires, and use them to secure the services of the mighty Djinn, whose aid will be invaluable in your quest to create the most stunning palace the city has ever seen.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/><br/>Players start out with a board, with a &quot;triangle&quot; of 3-tiles worth built, and have to expand that out to make the best (most VP-earning) palace. There are separate stacks of tiles for each layer of the palace, color coded (blue, red, green, and sky). Besides the color-coded levels, there are attributes that have to match up, like doorways and columns.<br/><br/>To get tiles, players reveal tiles from one pile and display them in front of the pile (up to 3 can be showing - the top of the pile is face up but can't be taken) and then choose a tile from any of the available tiles in any color. You try to choose a tile that will give you points and/or gems. The gems let you buy genies, which have special powers like building twice in one turn, or moving a tile you previously placed.<br/><br/>Players are limited by the edges of the starting board, including the bonus tiles (question marks). You have to have at least one tile beneath you to build, and you can't make a hole in the palace, so things are somewhat constrained. The tiles are two-sided and can be flipped if you need the mirror-image tile.<br/><br/>Each player board has attributes that score points, like windows or plants. You also have 2 hidden objectives/bonuses, which might be points for making a column of windows. The game ends when someone builds their fifth sky tile.

In most cases, a magical beast is merely a wild animal that through a trick of magic has gained abilities not normally possible in the natural world. Some can breathe fire, others can petrify their opponents, and still others can slip into the ethereal plane at will. Magical beasts make good opponents because of their combination of combat skills and magical abilities allow them to handle a wide range of party abilities. Most of these creatures have abilities that enhance their prowess in melee, posing a difficult challenge for both the characters&rsquo; abilities and the players&rsquo; problem solving skills. Best of all, most magical beasts are either classic gaming monsters or inspired by myth.

A.K.A. Bill Helmeczi.<br/><br/>BACKGROUND<br/><br/>Ever since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, that nation's foreign intelligence service, Mossad, has been diligent in tracking down and either capturing or exterminating former members of the Nazi regime who were involved in the Shoah - the Holocaust. For the past five decades they have been extremely successful in this task, and at the beginning of the twenty-first century there are scarcely a handful of these aging war criminals still alive throughout the world. Mossad's task in tracking down aging Nazi war criminals is nearing an end... and none too soon, given the current crises in the Middle East that demand more immediate attention.<br/><br/>There is, however, at least one loose end. In 1964 Mossad first came across a strange anomaly... Dr. Wilhelm Yeager, a medical 'researcher' at the Dakow concentration camp, was located living in Florence, Italy under an assumed name. What startled the Israeli intelligence agents was that Wilhelm Yeager did not appear to have aged a single day since he was last photographed in Munich in 1945.<br/><br/>The effort in 1964 failed to apprehend Yeager, as did two other covert attempts since then, one in Istanbul in 1977 and one in Montreal in 1990. On both occasions Mossad agents reported that Yeager did not appear to have aged in any way. His wiliness in escaping repeated capture attempts by one of the world's most effective intelligence services has also proven that age has robbed him of none of his wits.<br/><br/>Mossad has lost three agents in the pursuit of Yeager since 1965, and for most of the past decade lost track of his whereabouts. A chance sighting, however, led to an investigation that has placed him living right here in this city under the assumed name of Bill Helmeczi.<br/><br/>"}, "145077": {"rpgitemversion": {"213996": "DOC Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Mission #0681", "rpgproducer": {"69284": "Erik Goodrich"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1715606.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"2591": "World of Darkness (cWoD Modern)"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"441": "Horror (Supernatural)"}, "rpg": {"440": "Orpheus"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1715606_t.png", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>A fan-created mission for Orpheus.<br/> From the Introduction:<br/><br/>MISSION TYPE: Espionage<br/><br/>Employer: Carlton Baker - Assistant Director of the FBI<br/><br/>LOCATION: Washington DC<br/><br/>BACKGROUND<br/><br/>Twenty-three days ago, the FBI raided a nightclub in Los Angeles.

Our client has expressed certain concerns over his impending re-election; although the reasons why have not been made fully clear to us, our client does not wish Senator Brahams to have a second term as New York Senator.

The Boeing MD-90 jetliner was carrying 142 people, 97 of whom were killed during the crash, including the entire crew. Quick-response emergency crews pulled the survivors from the flaming wreckage of the smouldering plane. The story made the rounds in the papers for a few days, but given that Boeing quickly attributed Flight 411's fall from the sky to minor design faults that could be quickly corrected, the incident blew over remarkably quickly. In the aftermath, Eastern Airlines managed to quietly salvage most of the plane.<br/><br/>Since that time, however, there have been a steadily increasing number of hauntings and supernatural occurrences on Eastern Airlines flights across the eastern U.S. seaboard. Passengers and crew of no less than fifteen Eastern Airlines flights have reported ghostly apparitions and 'disappearing' figures on board planes, most (but not all) of which originated out of Miami International Airport. Most of the incidents have been fairly benign, but as of late have been growing increasingly belligerent and violent. Two months ago a meal cart being pushed by a stewardess was apparently physically lifted out of the aisle by unseen hands and flung at the stewardess, delivering her a major concussion. Last week, Flight 1173 from Miami International to Boston was forced to make an emergency landing in Roanoke, Virginia after a ghostly apparition materialised on board mid-flight, terrorising and attacking passengers and crew members.<br/><br/>Following the Flight 1173 incident, Eastern Airlines has approached Orpheus to deal with the problem, hopefully as quietly as possible.<br/><br/>"}, "145096": {"rpgitemversion": {"214022": "DOC Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Mission #0791", "rpgproducer": {"69308": "indierockclimber"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1715621.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"2591": "World of Darkness (cWoD Modern)"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"441": "Horror (Supernatural)"}, "rpg": {"440": "Orpheus"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1715621_t.png", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>A fan-created mission for Orpheus.<br/> From the Introduction:<br/><br/>MISSION TYPE: Retrieval/Special<br/><br/>LOCATION: The Andromeda, Off the coast of Alaska<br/><br/>EMPLOYER: Aurora Borealis Luxury Tours<br/><br/>BACKGROUND<br/><br/>16 hours ago the Luxury Liner &quot;Andromeda&quot; was rocked by an explosion from deep within engineering, 400 miles off the coast of Alaska, near the Aleutian islands.

The crucible is on the run, and only just beginning to realise the extent of the forces amassed against them.<br/><br/>The crucible is located by another apparent Orpheus survivor, a woman named Alya Townsend. Alya is a projected sleeper agent who claims to have been away on an extended mission during the attack on Orpheus. Upon hearing the news, she says, she immediately returned to the ruins of Orpheus HQ, but searching through the debris she was unable to find the cryo-tank that was keeping her body in stasis. It had been removed, and since Alya is still alive (a sleeper rather than a spirit) her body is still out there somewhere, presumably still in cryo-sleep.<br/><br/>Alya begs the crucible for help. She claims to have been projected for over two months on an extended haunting mission when she got word of the destruction of Orpheus, and is now on the verge of hysterics. Her mental health (see page 117 of Crusade of Ashes) is in serious jeopardy, and the problem only becomes worse the longer she spends outside of her body.<br/><br/>What the characters do not know, but will probably find out the hard way, is that Alya lost her sanity a long time ago. Alya Townsend was, in fact, one of the early Project Echo sleepers, the second generation of Orpheus agents. She was one of the first long-term sleepers, and it was through her that Orpheus learned that extended projecting on the part of sleepers can cause severe psychological damage. She became addicted to Skinriding, staying out of her body for longer and longer and refusing to obey orders to go on beach. She taught herself to burst-project when she was on beach time, so severe was her addicted. A number of months ago she fled from the Orpheus Group rather than be forced back into her body after a mission, and has been in a projected state since that time.  As might be imagined, the damage to her psyche has been considerable.<br/><br/>However, Alya's body is gone... it was stolen away from the Orpheus HQ, and now that the Orpheus Group has been destroyed, she wants it back, if only to help her recuperate from the madness that now grips her every thought. Somebody removed her body from Sub-Basement 4 following the attack on Orpheus. She wants the crucible's help in locating her body again, though she doesn't want the fact that she went MIA to become known to them and will happily lie to the characters to convince them otherwise.<br/><br/>"}, "145100": {"boardgamedesigner": {"69322": {"name": "Niels Wonsyld"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Conjurers", "playingtime": "150", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2082": "Worker Placement"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "18", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1721621_t.jpg", "average": "5.52778", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"25520": {"name": "Wonder Games (I)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1721621.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"214026": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "150", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "150", "description": "&quot;After the king&rsquo;s death, your country is at civil war, and the mayor of your town seeks the most powerful conjurer to lead the troops against rival armies from neighbor towns. You know that if you could prove yourself worthy of leading these troops, fame and wealth would follow. By assembling the most powerful army of mythological creatures equipped with rare artifacts, you will beat the other conjurers in town.&quot;<br/><br/>During the twelve rounds of &quot;Conjurers&quot;, the conjuring players and their assistants struggle to gather sufficient resources to purchase powerful items and magical artifacts. Simultaneously, they need to build up their armies of mythological creatures in order to wage war against increasingly powerful beasts and rivaling conjurers alike. The conjurers will have to fight at the mythological battlegrounds of Olympus Mons, Valhalla, Shangri La, Garden of Eden, and Duat in order to force the defeated creatures to be summoned to future battles at the conjurers' demand. Time is of the essence, each turn is valuable, and faulty decisions can cost you dearly.<br/><br/>&quot;Conjurers&quot; takes place in a mythological universe and is a game of priorities and strategy, which allows for a high degree of diversity from game to game. So buckle up, and prepare for an intense and challenging experience from start to finish.<br/><br/>Game description:<br/><br/>&quot;Conjurers&quot; is a strategy board game based on five different mythologies: The Biblical, the Egyptian, the Greek, the Japanese, and the Norse. The objective is to collect the highest number of points, which are all counted by the end of the game, after round 12. Points may be gathered through creatures, artifacts, and resources. A player may choose a strategy of striving for one or more of various point bonuses, such as an Abundance Bonus, which is unlocked by controlling a large number of creatures within the same mythology by the end of the game. It is therefore possible to disrupt the plans and strategies of the opponents throughout the game &ndash; if you succeed in figuring out their strategy.<br/><br/>&quot;Conjurers&quot; is a worker placement game, which consists of 4 phases, each with 3 rounds. At the start of each phase new actions are unlocked. The primary actions are to:<br/><br/>&bull;    gather resources<br/>&bull;    buy items and artifacts<br/>&bull;    hire assistants to get more actions<br/>&bull;    attempt to gain control of a mythological creature by defeating it in battle<br/>&bull;    collect feed for your creatures<br/>&bull;    sacrifice creatures to gain resources and optimize your army<br/>&bull;    duel the other conjurers<br/><br/>Each player starts with one conjurer figure, one assistant figure, and three level 1 creatures in their armies. If a player allocates the conjurer figure or the warrior assistant to one of the mythological battlegrounds, he or she may choose any creature, level 2 &ndash; 5, from the given mythology and fight it. If the player defeats the creature, he or she collects it, and it becomes part of that player&rsquo;s army. A conjurer can only bring three creatures from the army into each battle. The fighting creatures are chosen at random after the player has declared which mythological creature he or she is attempting to defeat. Optimizing your army is therefore vital if you wish to try to collect the higher level creatures.<br/><br/>Please note that &quot;Conjurers&quot; is a worker placement game; the battle sequences are rather brief, and it is the strategic decisions on point combinations and player interaction which is at the heart of the game.

On the frontier of land that falls within the protectorate of Mor Aldenn, Duny Slough is deep within the Spindlewood Marsh, moving deeper each season. Annually with the thawing of winter, the huts and wicker-halls of Duny Slough are rebuilt atop one of the marsh's great peat bogs. Peat is then harvested until the first frost, when the village is again abandoned, only to be rebuilt in a new location the following spring. The gleaners of Duny Slough, mostly halflings, are no strangers to hardship so deep in the Spindlewood Marsh. Regular encounters with savage lizardfolk tribes and gargantuan serpents are commonplace and there is always the threat of bog giants, witches and their familiars, hags, and worse. The gleaners endure as they always have, their peat fertilizes fields and lights hearthfires throughout the region, their way of life a delicate balance of industry and adventure.<br/><br/>&quot;The Wasting of Duny Slough&quot; is the first chapter of the Viridian Legacy Adventure Path.

Decampment is the first game to be released by F Squared Game, an upcoming tabletop game company created by two friends who were inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft and want to keep the competitive spirit alive between family and friends. F Squared games has been working on Decampment for a little over a year before launching. Enlisting the help of family, friends, and fellow board game enthusiast for countless hours of play testing to ensure it is an enjoyable, simple and affordable game for everyone.<br/><br/>Decampment is a very simple game, unlike most other RPG style games. It is very easy to understand and anyone is able to play. Most aspects of the game are determined by the roll of only one die. We wanted to keep this game simple because we find it harder to enjoy, let alone finish, the more complex games and tired of reading large rulebooks before even attempting to play the game.<br/>Here is a brief overview of the main parts of the game. <br/>-Movement around the Board: Roll a die and you're on your way, you are able to move any one of the four directions throughout your move as long as you don't touch the same space twice in one move.<br/>-Battling with Hood Cards: Hood Cards have an attack and defense number listed right on the card. To win the battle, you simply have to roll one die a higher number that the card's listed defense number. If you fail to do so, the attack number on the card comes into play. The difference of your roll and the attack number is the amount of life points you lose.<br/>-Dueling with other players: Very similar to facing the hood cards, but both players have one die and roll against each other. The difference in the rolls is the amount of life points the defeated player loses.<br/>-Weapon Cards: Weapons are very helpful and are taken from hood cards if you successfully defeat them. They modify your attack rolls by adding the fixed number listed on the weapon card and work against hood cards as well as dueling with other players.<br/><br/>"}, "145170": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6833": {"name": "Wojciech Zalewski"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Tantek 1942/45", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1998", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"24441": "B-35"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1809946_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5251": {"name": "Dragon"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1809946.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"214137": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "age": "14", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Game simulates fictional battles at western Pacific, fought between Japanese and American forces at the Tantek archipelago.

Sourcing a supply of canned fish may be a way to survive the diminishing sea ice &mdash; and if nothing else, it gives them a good reason to travel all the way from the North Pole to Germany to party down with their doggie friends there!<br/><br/>Pick-a-Polar Bear, first published as Formissimo, features the same gameplay as Pick-a-Dog but with two new variants! To set up the basic game, lay out 30 cards in a grid and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, with/without a raised arm, orange autumn/blue winter background, with/without goggles, and with/without canned fish. Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.<br/><br/>Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot; The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card. If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.<br/><br/>To set up for the next round, give each player a new face-down card and fill in the holes in the grid. When the deck runs out, complete that round, after which the game ends. Whoever has collected the most cards wins!<br/><br/>Pick-a-Polar Bear includes two game variants. In the first, the player who has obtained the most cards in the preceding round cannot grab a card that's identical to his top card in the current round. For the second variant, shuffle eight &quot;bonus round&quot; cards into the deck. If when laying out the cards in the grid, the dealer reveals the back of a bonus round card when at least ten cards are on the table, everyone prepares for the bonus round. The dealer reveals this card, which shows two card elements such as upraised arm and goggles, and everyone races to yell out how many cards in the grid feature these two elements. Whoever yells out the correct answer first receives the bonus round card, which is worth 2 points; whoever yells out the wrong answer takes a -2 point penalty card. The dealer then continues filling the grid. (If the grid contains fewer than ten cards when a bonus round card comes up in the deck, discard this card and continue to fill the grid.)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"248831": "Chinese / English / German edition"}, "average": "6.49201", "name": "Pick-a-Polar Bear", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2060": "Pattern Recognition"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "334", "boardgamefamily": {"39141": "Animal Rascals"}}, "145187": {"statistics": {}, "bgaccessoryversion": {"214154": "First edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1717034.jpg", "description": "Pack of 20 custom dice to upgrade the standard dice in the base game.

Over the course of the seven decades covered by the game, you will have to invest in infrastructures and industries, provide your country with energy and invest in advanced research in order to remain competitive.<br/><br/>But prosperity has a price. You owe it to future generations to leave them a healthy world. Pollution lurks, but will you be able to limit it?<br/><br/>Prosperity has players building up their countries on a grand but abstract scale, with them needing to balance concerns over energy and ecology with the constant need for capital and the long-term goal of prosperity points.<br/><br/>The game starts with 24 tiles available, half on the energy side of the shared game board and half on the ecology side. Two tiles on each side are placed on levels 1-6, with the players each having two research markers &ndash; energy and ecology &ndash; that start at level 1. Each player has an individual game board with color-coded spaces for tiles, a pollution track, and tracks for energy and ecology. A stack of 36 tiles &ndash; with tiles arranged by decades: the six from 2030 on the bottom, then the five from 2020, and so on to the five from 1970 &ndash; is set up during the playing area.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws the top tile from the stack, then everyone resolves the symbol highlighted on the tile:<br/><br/><br/>    Energy &ndash; for a positive value, earn money; for a negative value, lose money or increase your pollution<br/>    Ecology &ndash; remove or add discs to your pollution track<br/>    Capital &ndash; earn money for each capital symbol on the tiles you own<br/>    Research &ndash; advance one research marker one space for each research symbol on tiles you own<br/>    Prosperity &ndash; score points for each prosperity symbol on tiles you own, but only if your pollution isn't maxed out<br/><br/><br/>Once everyone has done this, the active player takes two actions, repeating an action if desired. The possible actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Take money.<br/>    Remove one pollution marker.<br/>    Move forward one space on one research track.<br/>    Buy a tile, with the amount owed being based on whether the tile is energy or ecology and the level of your corresponding research marker.

For that matter they can be allies in one adventure and enemies in the next.<br/><br/>This supplement details the members of Hunters Inc, the non-superpowered support staff who make their work possible, the weapons, vehicles and team tactics they use.  It includes a section on how they plan and execute missions, as well as an introductory adventure that lets the PCs play either for or against the team.<br/><br/>Plain Brown Wrapper Games is proud to be able to put Jeff Boman's classic superhero supplement back in print at last!

All animals must be shipped to the own port in order to organize a zoo.&rdquo; Winner is the Player, who first transports full collection of animals to the port, where his trip started.<br/><br/>Gameplay is divided to rounds. During a round all Players move their ships according to the turn order.<br/><br/>Distance that can be passed by a ship is determined by each Player with a die roll.<br/><br/>Oceans have plenty of currents and an experienced captain can use favorable ones in order to speed up his trip over the oceans vastness. A ship that moved to a hex with a current passes one hex in a direction of a current and this movement does not decrease remaining movement points.<br/><br/>In order to quickly pass large distances, desperate captain can use whirlpools (their total number is 6). In order to use whirpools, Player rolls a die, passes corresponding number of hexes and if he finishes in a whirlpool, he rolls a die once more. New number will show in which whirlpool the Player will start his new turn.<br/><br/>Each Player at the beginning of the game has 2 shots (so 2 fire tokens are put on a ship card). In order to fire, a Player has to finish his movement near an opponent&rsquo;s ship. After that he rolls a die and result indicates a cabin, which was hit. (e.g., cabin 6 is hit in a die roll of 6). If the cabin is empty, a shot is unlucky. If an animal was in cabin, a shoot hits an animal out of the ship, and wind and waves return it to its natural living place (a captain must place an animal token to any of the empty red hexes on the animal&rsquo;s continent).<br/><br/>SECOND GAME.<br/>The board is 2-sided.

The great mystery has been bled out of it: it is merely a tool, something to be studied, harnessed, and taken for granted. Now, to some, this would seem to be only natural. It makes sense that a society containing so many accomplished wizards would be able to reduce magic to the point of it behaving as mere science. That being said, it's simply missing out on a great opportunity for fun!<br/><br/>One Bling to Rule Them All presents a socketed magic item format that the PCs use to produce custom magic items. Based on a triad of focal items, the weapon, the crown, and the baton, PCs quickly learn that various magical crystals and gems they find produce interesting effects in their equipment; however, the effect is different for each kind of focal item! When one of these crystals is analyzed, it is impossible to figure out exactly what it does. Instead, the PCs learn the school, aura strength, and emotion of the gem. This causes the party to make educated guesses and, sometimes, even take risks in the hopes that the next item summons a 30-foot cone of ravenous mosquitoes.<br/><br/>Why would a player hope for a cone of ravenous mosquitoes? Because it's possible in this system!<br/><br/>The capstone of each focal item is a nexus crystal. Nexus crystals are either an embodiment of raw, entropic power and have very random abilities, or have abilities that are thematically linked in an interesting fashion. In either case, nexus crystals are a one shot deal. Once installed on a focal item, removal destroys the nexus crystal. This makes things quite risky indeed once the party realizes that every single nexus crystal carries with it an annoying, and sometimes downright brutal, downside.<br/><br/>This product features:<br/><br/>     Different abilities for different PCs, thus making it easier to avoid reselling and maintaining a proper wealth-by-level curve<br/>     A solid injection of wonder back into the world of magic items<br/>     Item emotions - analyze your crystals and determine their abilities by sleuthing and experimentation, or just plain dumb luck<br/>     Nexus crystals - capstone crystals with random or thematically linked abilities, as well as a nasty little downside you need to learn to live with<br/>     73 lesser crystals with a total of 177 different abilities<br/>     18 specific nexus crystals<br/>     A random generator that can produce over 3.3 million combinations of nexus crystals<br/>     Tables to integrate into the main Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules<br/>     Bookmarks, limited internal linking, and gem photography by Rob Lavinsky and others<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "145298": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Charmbrewer Witch Archetype", "rpgproducer": {"67854": "Bradley Crouch"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1719798.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"214338": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"22130": "Class Expansions"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1719798_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>While many witches revel in the powers granted them by their patron, some find the notion of using power with an unknown source to be rather disconcerting. These witches elect to use the connection to their patron as a source of knowledge from which they can distill power that functions without the patron's further influence. This knowledge comes in many forms, but the most common is that of the production of charms and other spells held within the liquid matrix of an elixir. Through this choice, a charmbrewer becomes bound to her cauldron in exchange for a slight weakening of the bond to her patron.<br/><br/>Class Expansions: The Charmbrewer Witch Archetype introduces the Charmbrewer witch archetype. Giving up the vast majority of her Hex powers, the Charmbrewer instead focuses on the production of thaumaturgic elixirs. Through the use of strange rules of consent that make her part con-artist, part voodoo shaman, the Charmbrewer's elixirs do not require saving throws if she tells her victims precisely what they're in for, but completely and utterly fail to do anything if forced upon the victim. Half measures, such as sneaking the elixirs into food, or not telling the whole truth about the function of an elixir, are covered in this supplement.<br/><br/>Included with the archetype is a list of 21 elixirs that cause nightmares, turn creatures into statues of solid fool's gold, cause the victim to become assaulted by phantasmal poison, cause one individual to die to allow somebody else to rise from the dead, and more!<br/><br/>"}, "145299": {"rpg": {"1433": "Hot Chicks"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Extreme Edge Volume Three Collection", "rpgproducer": {"17349": "Scott Corum"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1719788.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"214339": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"10262": "Extreme Edge"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1719788_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>All Twelve Issues In One Package!<br/><br/>It's all twelve issues of the third volume of Extreme Edge!

Players work to improve themselves and become more desirable as potential wives for the available Suitors. The ladies do this by attending Events and improving their Characters, but advantage can be gained by the use of Cunning. All of their efforts are in hopes of securing the husband that will make them the most satisfied character at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Game play is divided into two stages: the initial Courtship Stage and the concluding Proposal Stage.<br/><br/>The Courtship Stage is when players try to improve their Heroine&rsquo;s chances of happiness by earning points playing Character Cards, and acquiring or playing Cunning Cards. Character Points help you to attract Suitors, and also count toward your total number of Character points at the end of the game.Cunning Points do not count towards your building your Character. However, the Heroine who has acquired the most Cunning will be the first player to enter the Proposal Stage later in the game, putting her at a significant advantage.<br/><br/>The Proposal Stage begins when Event Cards have been played. In this stage, players will roll to see which Suitor proposes to them, decide if they will marry them, and calculate their final score.<br/><br/>175 cards in the base game, 6 player aid cards.<br/><br/>Standard American Board Game Sleeves - 56mm x 87mm<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"214350": "First Edition"}, "average": "6.34728", "rpgpodcastepisode": {"178595": "Episode 215: Forge Recap"}, "name": "Marrying Mr. Darcy", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "704", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "145309": {"poll": {}, "name": "\u03a4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2078": "Point to Point Movement"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "10", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2330454_t.jpg", "average": "5.9", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2400": {"name": "Desyllas Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2330454.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"214352": "Second Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "&Eta; &sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;\u03ac &epsilon;&pi;&iota;&tau;&rho;&alpha;&pi;\u03ad&zeta;&iota;&omega;&nu; &pi;&alpha;&iota;&chi;&nu;&iota;&delta;&iota;\u03ce&nu; &Tau;&alpha;&xi;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;\u03cd&omicron;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigmaf; &alpha;&pi;&omicron;&tau;&epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;\u03af &mu;&iota;&alpha; &delta;&iota;&alpha;&chi;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&kappa;\u03ae &alpha;&xi;\u03af&alpha; &sigma;&tau;&omicron; &chi;\u03ce&rho;&omicron; &tau;&omega;&nu; &epsilon;&pi;&iota;&tau;&rho;&alpha;&pi;\u03ad&zeta;&iota;&omega;&nu; &pi;&alpha;&iota;&chi;&nu;&iota;&delta;&iota;\u03ce&nu;, &alpha;&phi;&omicron;\u03cd &pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&phi;\u03ad&rho;&epsilon;&iota; &gamma;&nu;\u03ce&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &delta;&iota;&alpha;&sigma;&kappa;&epsilon;&delta;\u03ac&zeta;&epsilon;&iota; &mu;&iota;&kappa;&rho;&omicron;\u03cd&sigmaf; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &mu;&epsilon;&gamma;\u03ac&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;! &Alpha;&nu;&alpha;&kappa;\u03ac&lambda;&upsilon;&psi;&epsilon; &alpha;&pi;\u03af&theta;&alpha;&nu;&alpha; &mu;\u03ad&rho;&eta;. &Mu;\u03ac&theta;&epsilon; &tau;&eta;&nu; &iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&rho;\u03af&alpha;, &tau;&eta;&nu; &pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&tau;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&kappa;\u03ae &kappa;&lambda;&eta;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&iota;\u03ac, &tau;&alpha; &alpha;&xi;&iota;&omicron;&theta;\u03ad&alpha;&tau;&alpha; &kappa;\u03ac&theta;&epsilon; &tau;\u03cc&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;. &Tau;&alpha; &pi;&alpha;&iota;&chi;&nu;\u03af&delta;&iota;&alpha; &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;\u03ad&chi;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu; &pi;\u03af&nu;&alpha;&kappa;&epsilon;&sigmaf;-&chi;\u03ac&rho;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &mu;&epsilon; &pi;\u03cc&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;-&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&theta;&mu;&omicron;\u03cd&sigmaf;, &kappa;\u03ac&rho;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf;- &pi;\u03cc&lambda;&epsilon;&omega;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &kappa;\u03ac&rho;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf;-&epsilon;&rho;&omega;&tau;\u03ae&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;.<br/><br/>The &quot;Traveling&quot; board games series is a timeless value in boardgames, as it offers knowledge and entertainment to both young and old people!<br/><br/>Discovered unexpected places, learn the history, cultural heritage and attractions of Greece.

All of Western Europe south of the Rhine and the Danube, southern Britain, North Africa, Egypt, the Balkans and most of the Levant was under its control. The mighty Roman army and its legions had rarely known defeat in living memory &ndash; and never for very long.<br/><br/>One upstart state and its wily, aggressive leader refused to bend the knee. For almost twenty years, and against all odds, King Decebalus of Dacia defied Rome from his fortress capital deep within the Carpathian Mountains. Composed of thousands of savage tribesmen, heavily armoured Sarmatian lancers and even captured Roman weapons, Dacia&rsquo;s armies proved to be powerful enough to keep the legions at bay. All this was to change with the ascension of the soldier-emperor Trajan, leading to one of antiquity&rsquo;s greatest conflicts &ndash; the Dacian Wars.<br/><br/>This supplement for Hail Caesar focuses on Rome&rsquo;s wars under Trajan against the Dacians and their Sarmatian allies. Featured battles include the Battle of Adamclisi, the Battle of Tapae and the Siege of Sarmizegetusa Regia.

TheEmperor Claudius demanded a victory, and what better way of doing it than to bring this savage nation under the Roman yoke.<br/><br/>Rome commanded huge armies of professional soldiers with the infrastructure needed to feed, transport, equip and command them. Opposing this mighty military machine was a mere patchwork of tribes and wild barbarian warriors. Refusing to yield to the conquerors, one man emerged as the champion of the Britons: Caractacus! Defeated in open battle, Caractacus turned to guerilla warfare: raiding and ambushing enemy troops on the march. No Roman could defeat him; in the end it was treachery that overcame the Briton&rsquo;s greatest champion: the treachery of Queen Cartimadua of the Brigantes.<br/><br/>It was another Queen of the Britons who, ten years later, led the greatest rebellion of all against Roman rule: Boudica, Queen of the Iceni. Years of resentment and oppression boiled over into a war that almost drove the Romans from Britain altogether, burning London and humbling even the mighty legions.<br/><br/>This then is the story of the Roman invasion of Britain, from the Claudian Conquest and wars of Caractacus until the defeat of Boudica and the destruction of the druids upon Mona.

It can be played as a team game or as a cooperative game. The players take the role of privateers for one or more of four great colonial powers: England, France, Spain and Holland. Each player has a captain, buys a ship and recruits a crew. Their goal is to beat the other colonial powers and make sure that they never show up in the area again. To accomplish this they plunder colonies, conquer enemy ships and hunt both pirates and merchant ships for treasure and glory.<br/><br/>Attacks and rolls to succeed are handled using dice pools. The captain has three values: Combat, Cunning and Health. Each ship also has three values: Sails, Cannons and Hull. Ships can always be upgraded, lost, sunk, bought, traded and conquered. Crew is handled using crewcards and a ship can take as many of those cards as it has in Hull. Combat is handled using battle cards and dice, random events are handled using event cards and actions taken by the game itself is handled using special influence cards and ship markers. The game board is modular and made out of big hex cards.<br/><br/>The game only exists as an english prototype at the moment, but will hopefully be published in 2015.

This system focuses on low damage points, no rolling for damage (weapons do either one or two points), called shots (location attempts) and extra attacks, even from the very first encounter. Very few combat scenarios should take more than a couple of minutes. A system with low damage points equates to greater risk of death to both the adventurer and the foe.<br/><br/>Fewer Rules? Let&rsquo;s face it, every system needs rules. This system also provides rules but many are optional and can be used or modified by the GM in whatever way he or she wishes. I tried to make rules that were easy to remember with little variation. I want the GM to spend less time looking stuff up and more time telling the story.<br/><br/>Heroes are Powerful? Yes! The hero gets to do pretty much anything he or she wants. Specializations (or training styles) provide a focused start but before long, many adventurers will be doing whatever they want. Fighting, picking locks, healing, using powerful magic... all skills used by one adventurer! Also, many of the simpler foes lack the heroic capabilities of the adventurer. This allows for more dramatic game play because the hero can now take more risks. Advancement is much quicker so players will want to get back to the table and play more often. No more waiting for months to level up!<br/><br/>No Named Spells? Why get stuck with named spells that are useless or have too specific of a function? I hated when my low level magic user quickly ran out of &quot;good&quot; spells for the day. This system gives the spell casting system to the player. They have magical power and use it as they wish. They can harness the elements, create illusions and conjure up whatever they want, when they want and how they want.<br/><br/>Unique Loot? This game system encourages the GM to create one-of-a-kind treasures for the adventurers. Will there still be that +1 sword? Of course, but my hope is that the GM adds a bit more to the treasure to make it special and unique.<br/><br/>User note:<br/>The title page is identified as &quot;ThrowiGames Simple Roleplaying System&quot;.

However, by late second century, court politics and poor governance has left it in rapid decline. The government was dominated by corrupt eunuchs and officials who levied heavy taxes on the peasants, resulting in public discontent. This culminated in the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jiao in 184 AD during the reign of Emperor Ling (168-189 AD).<br/><br/>Although the Yellow Turban Rebellion was eventually put down, many surviving followers went on to become bandits and continued to create problems for the government. The Han army was unable to control the bandits and Emperor Ling granted direct administrative power over provinces and command of regional military to local lords. Many feudal lords took the opportunity to sever ties with the Han government and ruled independently. The more ambitious lords annexed neighboring territories to expand their power bases. This led to the emergence of the three power blocs of Wei, Wu and Shu, and ushered in the Three Kingdoms period.<br/><br/>Three Kingdoms Redux is a board game that seeks to recreate the tripartite between the states of Wei, Wu and Shu. You assume the role of one of the three lords &ndash; Cao Cao leading Cao Wei, Sun Jian leading Eastern Wu or Liu Bei leading Shu Han. Players start the game from asymmetrical positions, reflecting the manpower advantages Wei enjoyed in the early part of the period. The weaker states of Wu and Shu protect themselves by forming an alliance. As a feudal lord, you manage the different aspects of running a state whilst guarding your borders against both rebellious border tribes and external enemies. Managing each aspect well earns victory points for your state. But beware, for the balance of power shifts constantly during the game. Understand and take advantage of the power shifts, and you will fulfill your grand ambition of re-unifying China!<br/><br/>In more detail, Three Kingdoms Redux is played over a number of rounds, up to a maximum of twelve. Players bid for various actions with their general tokens. The highest bidder of each action space obtains the right to carry out the actions.<br/><br/>These actions allow players to improve your state&rsquo;s domestic development, gain military strength, construct state enhancements, increase popularity with your people, improve relationships with border tribes and gain promotion for the lord, to the next higher rank.<br/><br/>The actions available to each player are: <br/><br/>     develop your state&rsquo;s farm or marketplace, <br/>     recruit or train army units, <br/>     produce weapons, <br/>     trade resources, <br/>     construct state enhancements,  <br/>     control the Han emperor, <br/>     demand tributes from your vassals, <br/>     win support from your people, <br/>     import technology, <br/>     improve your relationship with your border tribe, or <br/>     wage battle against other states to expand your borders.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"214446": "English first edition"}, "average": "8.08738", "name": "Three Kingdoms Redux", "playingtime": "165", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "14", "usersrated": "461", "boardgameaccessory": {"168342": "Three Kingdoms Redux: Generals' Illustration Booklet"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"9470": "Asian Theme"}}, "145372": {"boardgamedesigner": {"69471": {"name": "John T.

It is a game meant to pit players against each other and as such can be completed from the start of the season to the championship game in less than an hour.<br/><br/>The first half of the game is a card-driven game where you build up your team by improving aspects of the game, winning key games and gaining ground in the standings. Not every team can make the playoffs but is it worth it to you to avoid the dreaded cellar spots in each division? Do you build a powerful dynasty? Can coaching and luck to carry you through? Or maybe you just decide to rely on your defense to lock the opponent's down. The way that you build your team is up to you.<br/><br/>At the end of the regular season, the game switches to a full-on dice game using the teams you created during the regular season. Teams match up for playoff games where your dice are the ones you labored to improve earlier. As your dice are expended in each quarter, the game gets more and more tense and often it comes down to one final toss of the die.<br/><br/>Although the game does not use hard and fast statistics and has no built in way to produce them, I find that it really scratches that sports itch that I used to spend hours on back in the day with Statis-Pro Football and Football Strategy.

The time of the sympathy strike and negotiations of the 21 Demands with the government delegation, completed by signing the August Agreements and the emergence of Solidarno\u015b\u0107 (the Solidarity movement), is the period when Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa scaled the shipyard fence and became not only the leader of the opposition, but also a front-page public figure.
