P. Lovecraft, author of The Call of Cthulhu and progenitor of the Cthulhu Mythos. It is effectively a re-imagining of Lovecraft's story The Shadow Over Innsmouth (though diverging from the story in several places, and featuring a different protagonist, several levels in the game mirror passages from the story). There is also a sub-plot inspired by Lovecraft's story The Shadow Out of Time. Further, many scenes and major events were directly taken from the Chaosium Call of Cthulhu role-playing game campaign &quot;Escape from Innsmouth.&quot;<br/><br/>The game has often been noted for featuring no HUD. The player character's condition is relayed through the sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing, which become more pronounced when wounded, and color draining from the screen with loss of blood and strength. Specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally - a broken leg will cause Jack to limp and will make appropriate noises, a broken arm will make aiming more difficult, etc.<br/><br/>Jack loses sanity when he looks directly at upsetting aspects of the game world, such as mutilated bodies or precipitous drops... Sanity loss can lead to hallucinations and visions, which manifest as graphical anomalies, sound distortion, and changes in control sensitivity. Also, Jack will begin to suffer from schizophrenia, hearing voices from various sources, such as his inner child pleading for him to go back to darker personalities that want him to come back with them. If he is sufficiently disturbed, then permanent insanity or suicide will result and the game will end. The health system was designed as a more realistic take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different forms of injury will require different remedies, such as a splint for a broken leg.<br/><br/>Initially, the gameplay mostly comprises unarmed escape and evasion, together with investigative exploration, although weapons and combat are introduced later on. As with most survival horror action/adventure games, ammunition is limited and must be conserved carefully for situations when it will really be indispensable, occasionally requiring the player to avoid combat, even when armed. The game as a whole is heavily scripted and extremely linear, with only one path through the chapters from start to finish...<br/><br/>"}, "76024": {"poll": [], "name": "SWAT Force", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Mobile Phone Release"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["SWAT"], "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "videogamefranchise": ["Police Quest"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Kaolink Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Other Mobile Devices"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Vivendi Games"], "description": "[Wikipedia: <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT_Force' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT_Force</a>]<br/><br/>SWAT Force is the first game of the SWAT series to be released for mobile phones.

It was released on Arcades in March 1997, and for the PlayStation in mid-1998. It was re-released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2 as part of Tekken 5's Arcade History mode...<br/><br/>Tekken 3 maintains the same core fighting system and concept as its predecessors, but brings many improvements, such as significantly more detailed graphics and animations, 15 new characters added to the game's roster, more modern music and faster and more fluid gameplay.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly-created combo throws.<br/><br/>Tekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up Streets of Rage style minigame called Tekken Force, which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first)... There is also a minigame called Tekken Ball, similar to beach volleyball, where one has to either &quot;charge&quot; a ball (hit the ball with a powerful attack) to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area, thus causing damage.<br/><br/>"}, "76032": {"poll": [], "name": "Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EN/EU PlayStation 2 Uncut edition", "NA PlayStation 2 edition", "NA Xbox edition", "US Windows edition", "US Windows Uncut and Uncensored Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic803532.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Leisure Suit Larry"], "videogametheme": ["Adult / Mature"], "usersrated": "26", "videogamecharacter": ["Larry Laffer"], "videogamedeveloper": ["High Voltage"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "Windows", "Xbox"], "videogamehonor": ["2005 Game Developers Choice Awards Best Narrative of the Year Nominee"], "average": "4.88462", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sierra Entertainment Inc."], "vgcharacterversion": ["Larry Laffer"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic803532_t.jpg", "description": "[Wikipedia: <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry</a>:_Magna_Cum_Laude]<br/><br/>Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude is a 2004 video game, part of the Leisure Suit Larry series.

Frost must use his new powers to help lead the Coalition to victory against overwhelming odds.<br/><br/>Similar to the Deus Ex series, the focus of Project: Snowblind's gameplay is giving the player a variety of choices on how to approach any given situation. Although the game is generally linear, most levels feature multiple paths through any given area, allowing players to either rush in guns blazing or attempt to find a more stealthy side-path. Unlike Deus Ex, the game is entirely centered around pure combat, but nonetheless provides the player with multiple options regarding every battle. Every weapon in the game has a secondary fire mode, several of which create exotic effects such as a swarm of drones that will actively seek out and attack enemies. The player can also throw a variety of grenades with different effects, including a riot shield that creates a temporary stationary energy wall for the player to take cover behind. The player can also use a special &quot;Icepick&quot; device to hack enemy cameras, turrets, and robots and use them against enemy forces. The game also features several driveable vehicles.

Lots of fun and interesting things happen during a road trip. There are sights to see, interesting people to meet, and shared moments to experience.<br/><br/>So I set out with the concept that there are certain elements that make up a road trip. First off there are the interesting characters who each have their own personalities and their own characteristics. These people also take on roles associated with the road trip, and based on these roles that they assume different actions can happen. So to me the idea that the game should be character driven was cemented in the ground. The characters inflict the game with their own brand of chaos and plot.<br/><br/>The Second element that makes up a proper road trip are the locations that the Trippers end up at. This bit should shadow the types of places that we always hear about and have found their way into the fabric of America on the go. The Roadside Attractions that draw millions of people a year, the rest stops that comfort and give respite to the millions of drivers traveling our roadways every day. The mom and pop restaurants that feed travelers and thrill seekers, those places that people tell you, if you are ever in Bassackwards, Arkansas then stop at Tiffanies, they have the greatest hamburgers ever. And of course the motels that dot our countryside providing us with places to sleep and to rest.<br/><br/>The third element is the stories that we tell about our Road Trip. People are enthralled by the tale of a good road trip where you drove up a 12% grade, and when you peaked, your radiator blew out. Only to know that down at the bottom of the grade awaited a gas station with repair shop, so you shifted it into neutral, and just flew down the grade. No one is interested in what happened when you got to your destination, they want to know about the trials that you went through.<br/><br/>So I extracted the tedious bit of the system out and boiled it down to a quick and simple round based system, and left no rules in the game that in anyway restricted the role-playing. When it comes to visiting an attraction or setting up for the night, the game essentially becomes a free-form role-playing situation.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, the system is not fully fleshed out and has ideas in it that I would love to play around with a little more, and put out a Deluxe version, but for now, it's playable. And remember those words: &quot;The Greatest College Tradition of all Time: The Road Trip..&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "76073": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["The Operation (24-hour RPG)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Operation", "rpgdesigner": ["Michael P.

It exists to ensure the safety and security of the public without falling into the manipulations and backroom dealings that are part of the daily routine of government s and global corporations. Its Operatives are culled from the best and brightest of the world's military, intelligence and academic communities<br/><br/>Unlike other intelligence agencies throughout the world like the British MI-5 and MI-6 and the American CIA, the Operation is a completely unknown entity to the public.<br/><br/>What It Takes<br/><br/>The Operation chooses its Operatives from the best and brightest of the world's Intelligence, Military and Academic communities. The Operation headhunts within these groups, looking for people that have skills that the Operation would find useful. Candidates must also be psychologically stable enough to be considered for engagement.<br/><br/>The Operation wants operatives that will think &quot;outside of the box&quot;. It has been found that candidates with a certain amount of dissatisfaction with their government or employer are easier to approach about becoming Operatives. As such, most candidates could be thought of as a little rebellious by their previous employers.<br/><br/>The Operation does not do much in the way of training its Operatives, as most Operatives are both already trained and brought into the fold for skills that they already possess. If necessary, newly acquired Operatives will be given basic training in martial skills, including hand-to-hand combat and the use of firearms.T<br/><br/>"}, "76074": {"poll": [], "name": "SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Game", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian GameCube edition", "Australian PlayStation 2 edition", "Australian Xbox edition", "English/European GameCube edition", "English/European Macintosh edition", "English/European PlayStation 2 edition", "English/European Windows edition", "English/European Xbox edition", "North American GameCube edition", "North American Macintosh edition", "North American PlayStation 2 (Greatest Hits) edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "North American Windows edition", "North American Xbox edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic982851.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon", "Movie, Book, TV show"], "videogamefranchise": ["Spongebob Squarepants"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Azure Wish Enterprise (AWE)", "Heavy Iron Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["GameCube", "Macintosh", "PlayStation 2", "Windows", "Xbox"], "usersrated": "9", "average": "4.88889", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Aspyr Media", "THQ"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic982851_t.jpg", "description": "From Wikipedia<br/><br/>The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Game is a SpongeBob SquarePants video game, based on the film, which is based on the show.

Despite the extremely simple nature of roguelike games, they continue to enjoy a large amount of popularity even today.<br/><br/>Despite its stated design goal of recreating the experience of very simple PC games on the table-top, Roguelike isn't a beginner's RPG - it assumes that the reader has at least some basic familiarity with the tenets and terms associated with table-top role-playing games.

As Lomax, the player must navigate through four main worlds with three levels each, in a side-scrolling platform game. The enemies are brainwashed lemmings who have been turned into monsters taking the form of zombies, cowboys, and aliens. Like some other platformers, bumping into them kills the player's character. The player's main attack spins Lomax around, and can be used to both avoid being killed by bumping into them, and &quot;kill&quot; them. By effectively &quot;killing&quot; them, they are turned back into ordinary lemmings and leave in peace. There are coins scattered throughout the levels that grant additional lives when enough are found. Magic helmets can also be found, which can be used as weapons and grant Lomax immunity from one attack, after which he loses the helmet. In addition to the standard platforming, Lomax can also use several abilities featured in the original Lemmings (game), such as builders and diggers, as well as others not found in the original.<br/><br/>"}, "76097": {"videogame": ["Lemmings", "Oh No!

It was published by Midway Games and developed by Psygnosis Camden Studio (now SCE Studio Soho).<br/><br/>The game is a mix of Worms' goofiness and a typical real-time strategy game. Central to the game's theme is the ability of a team of buddies to stack crates in a 2x2x2 pad located in their starting area. Stacking the crates in different ways make different items when the resulting larger crate is broken; for example, a single crate on a stacking pad produces a light weapon, four crates positioned horizontally makes a heavy weapon, and filling the pad creates a vehicle. Up to three additional team members can also be created by stacking crates directly on top of each other; these new &quot;buddies&quot; can be commanded to attack or defend a certain area or even build on the stacking pad on their own. The player can swap between any of the buddies under his or her control in order to make use of that particular unit's powers or weapons.<br/><br/>In addition to a stacking pad, each starting point has a large base building which can be attacked and destroyed. If a base is destroyed, the stacking pad for that team can no longer be used; this means that new members cannot be created, making destroying the base a top priority for securing victory. A team without a base is also unable to build new weapons and must rely on those dropped by the enemy or found around the map (although a fast unit can steal a weapon from an enemy pad as it is being opened).<br/><br/>A typical map will have various &quot;crate drop&quot; areas (in most cases a small area at the players base and a much larger spawn in the middle of the map), where the crates used to build weapons and teammates fall from the sky. Most crates in the game are yellow with red borders, but yellow crates with blue borders also drop from time to time. Adding one of these to a crate formation causes the object or unit created by it to have increased abilities; for example, a higher rate of fire or range for a weapon or more hit points for a unit or vehicle. In certain maps, mega-crates also drop if certain conditions are met; these large, grey crates contain a weapon or vehicle not normally found in that particular area.<br/><br/>Team Buddies also supports split-screen multiplayer for up to four players.<br/><br/>"}, "76127": {"poll": [], "name": "Populous DS", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["DS EU Release", "DS Japan Release", "DS NA Release"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic768206.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Populous"], "videogametheme": ["Mythology"], "usersrated": "6", "videogamedeveloper": ["Genki Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Real Time Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS"], "average": "4.25", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Electronic Arts (EA)", "Rising Star Games", "Xseed Games"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic768206_t.jpg", "description": "From Wikipedia:<br/><br/>Populous DS (\u30dd\u30d4\u30e5\u30e9\u30b9 DS, Popyurasu DS?) is a real-time strategy developed by Genki.

From Wikipedia]<br/><br/>Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. is a 3D fighting game released by Midway in 1998. It saw a limited release in arcades and was later released for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The game uses a fully polygonal fighting engine, with 8 different fighters, and 2 boss fighters. It sets itself apart from the majority of fighting games by not locking the players down to a 2D plane of combat, allowing the players to move in full 3D including flying into the air for short periods. This allows you to move to higher levels in the arenas, of which there are 10, though only 9 are selectable in Vs. modes. Some of the arenas also have traps which can damage the characters or even kill them immediately.<br/><br/>Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. uses a mix of hand-to-hand and long range combat. Each character has an assortment of special attacks, both close and long range, as well as 'finishing attacks'. Much like the Fatalities of the Mortal Kombat games these moves can execute your opponents while some, like in Time Killers, will remove limbs.

This is not a game about mass combat, or saving the day. This is about being a poor, underfed, cold, sick, and scared man who is waist deep in the snow, and is not sure if they will live to see another sunrise. A time where your first inclination upon seeing a dog is who gets first dibs when you eat it. Somewhere out across the frozen steppes, a monster is lurking, and you have barely more than sticks and stones to stop it. Read a book about the siege of Leningrad, or the battles of Kursk and Stalingad to understand what the players are stuck in. The movie &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; is another excellent resource.<br/><br/>Perhaps there is time for joviality in this atmosphere. People need an escape somehow, and sharing bread in these times can be as hard as facing the enemy. Give the players a chance for heroism, and more importantly, give them a chance to role play! How do they feel about fighting for the motherland? Do they really believe in communism, or are they simply afraid of the commissar?<br/><br/>Its worth noting that there are no maximum ranges provided for the weapons listed. While I'm normally a stickler for accuracy in my mechanics and highly skilled characters, we are talking about under trained draftees thrown into the meat grinder. The GM is the arbiter of what can and can't be done. Dramatic license has a part though. Just because theres no table of vehicle hit locations doesn't mean that the characters can't take careful aim to disable it.<br/><br/>This is a 24 hour game, though I still plan on working on it, though technically my time is up. Actually, since I slept and ate, its probably more of a 6 hour game, but hopefully you can still enjoy it.<br/><br/>"}, "76146": {"rpgdesigner": ["Scott Aniolowski", "Brian Courtemanche", "Adam Gauntlett", "Bret Kramer", "Tom Lynch", "Oscar Rios"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "More Adventures in Arkham Country", "rpgartist": ["Santiago Caruso", "Reuben Dodd", "Jason Eckhardt", "Stephanie McAlea"], "rpgproducer": ["Christopher Smith Adair", "Michael Hurst", "Tom Lynch", "Badger McInnes", "Lisa Padol", "Oscar Rios"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782425.jpg", "usersrated": "12", "rpgsetting": ["Cthulhu Classic (1920s & 1930s)"], "average": "7.10833", "rpgissuearticle": ["ARKHAM \u2013 OSTOJA ROZS\u0104DKU", "ARKHAM \u2013 PRZYBYTEK SZALE\u0143STWA"], "rpg": ["Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)", "Trail of Cthulhu"], "rpgpublisher": ["Miskatonic River Press"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782425_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>In 1993, Keith Herber took investigators on an Adventure in Arkham Country.

The effects of supporting machine gun and mortar companies are abstracted in the game mechanics and card system.<br/><br/>"}, "76150": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2237528.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Aliens: This Time It's War"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mark Chaplin"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Xavier Carrascosa", "Chechu Nieto"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Pegasus Spiele", "REXhry", "Stronghold Games", "White Goblin Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2237528_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["American West", "Card Game", "Fighting"], "boardgamehonor": ["2012 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee", "2012 Gouden Ludo Nominee"], "description": "Howdy, ya'll.<br/>C'mon in and sit a spell. Let me tell ya about Jack Colty and his gang, and get ya up to gallop on all the interestin' events. Those filthy drovers and gunslingers are dangerous and desperate, each one generally havin' killed a man, and be content to live on a diet of Navy plug and whiskey.<br/>I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after hearin' this here stupefyin' story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess you folks can make up yer own minds why I retired early.<br/><br/>The year is 1892.<br/>The bank at Repentance Springs has been robbed.<br/>Many good citizens, including Sheriff Anton Dreyfus and school-marm Sue Daggett, were brutally slain as Colty's gang shot its way, whooping and hollering, out of town.<br/>Colonel Ned McReady and his men are tasked with bringing Jack Colty - a man so mean he'd steal a fly from a blind spider, or a coin off a dead man's eyes - and his gang to justice.<br/><br/>Revolver is a non-collectable card game set in the Old West.<br/><br/>Consisting of two balanced 62 card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang.<br/><br/>At their disposal, the Colty gang - the meanest bunch of low down dirty dogs in the West - have a roster of weaponry to bring down the lawmen on their tail: .38 Specials, .45 Long Colts, 1866 double barrel Derringers, and even a Gatling gun! Some example cards from the gang's deck: Cherokee Scout, &quot;Adios, Amigoes!&quot;, &quot;Thanks for yer coffee and eggs, ma'am&quot;, and &quot;Chew on this, Gringo!&quot;<br/><br/>The Colonel player's objective is to eliminate all the gang members before they can escape across the Mexican border. He can utilise such cards as Buffalo Stampede, Rattlesnake Bite, &quot;I can smell those yellow bellies on the wind&quot;, &quot;He shot my hat clean off!&quot; Apache Scout, and Rickety Bridge.<br/><br/>The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Revolver is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive gunfights in the following battlegrounds: The Bank at Repentance Springs, Whiskey Canyon, Buzzard Point, Rattlesnake Creek, and the 3:15 Express from Rattlesnake Station. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with bandits gunned down frequently, and law-men peppered with lead by the well-placed use of &quot;Fire at will, boys.&quot;<br/><br/>Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colty player could choose to deploy the Jackson Clan during the Whiskey Canyon battle, but the resources that this would require might make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Colonel McReady player can deploy the Colonel at any time during the conflict - he's free to play aboard the 3:15 Express Train, but hugely expensive if used at Buzzard Point, for instance. Also, during the final confrontation, Jack Colty can force the train to crash - as a last ditch effort, probably killing some of his own crew in the process - he's as crazy as popcorn on a hot stove!<br/><br/>Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. Some simple icons are used to display such things as 'coming-into-play' effects, and if a gringo has 'True Grit'.<br/><br/>Revolver can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, and is a new implementation of Aliens: This Time It's War.<br/><br/>Victory Conditions:<br/><br/>The Colty Gang player wins if he manages to &quot;Escape across the Mexican border.&quot;<br/>The Colty Gang player wins if he reaches and survives the battle on the 3:15 Express train.<br/>The Colonel McReady player wins if Jack Colty and all the gang members are either hanged or killed.<br/>The Colonel McReady player wins if Cortez is killed before boarding the 3:15 Express train.<br/><br/>Each bandit character card has a Survival Rating, indicating the likelihood of them surviving to the end of the game. For example, Lenny and Micky Mason have a low chance of survival, whereas Cortez has a high Survival Rating. Also, certain character's deaths have hugely detrimental effects on the game, such as having to discard a card, or in &quot;Kittens&quot; Mackenzie's case: the gang having to fight an extra two turns on the Rattlesnake Creek battlefield.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Cezch/Slovak first edition", "Dutch edition", "German first edition", "Stronghold Games English edition", "White Goblin Games English edition"], "average": "6.95608", "name": "Revolver", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Revolver Expansion 1.1: Ambush on Gunshot Trail", "Revolver Expansion 1.2: Hunt the Man Down", "Revolver Expansion 1.3: Vengeance on the Frontier", "Revolver Expansion 1.4: The Tarnished Star", "Revolver Expansion 1.5: Death Rides a Horse", "Revolver: Brady Logan Promo Card", "Revolver: By the Gun They Died", "Revolver: Elias Hooker Promo Card"], "usersrated": "1170", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Revolver"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 20 - Wizards, Westerns, and Brothels!", "EPSIODE 19 - NO MA'AM!", "The Long View: Revolver", "The One About Culling and Critics"]}, "76151": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "poll": [], "name": "GameMastery Map Pack: Swallowed Whole", "rpgartist": ["Corey Macourek"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic777857.jpg", "usersrated": "5", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Paizo Publishing"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["GameMastery", "Pathfinder Map Pack"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic777857_t.jpg", "description": "From the pack of the pack:<br/><br/>You're on the menu!<br/><br/>Fight fantasy's classic carnivore from the inside!

The updated suit has since been a staple of the series, appearing in all subsequent games.<br/><br/>The story of Metroid II follows the protagonist and playable character Samus Aran, who is sent on a mission to exterminate the Metroid creatures from their home planet SR388 before the antagonistic Space Pirates obtain and use them. On the planet, Samus encounters Metroids in different stages of their evolution cycle, ranging in forms from small jellyfish-like creatures to large, hovering, reptilian beasts. Eventually, Samus reaches the Queen Metroid and kills it. Continuing through the planet's caverns, Samus finds a Metroid egg, which hatches in front of her. The creature forms a bond with Samus and follows her to her gunship, setting the plot for Super Metroid (1994).<br/><br/>"}, "76167": {"poll": [], "name": "Kirby: Squeak Squad", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Nintendo DS Edition", "Wii U eShop Downloadable edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782063.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamefranchise": ["Kirby"], "videogamecharacter": ["King Dedede", "Kirby", "Meta Knight"], "videogamedeveloper": ["HAL Laboratory, Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS", "Wii U"], "usersrated": "12", "average": "5.99167", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "vgcharacterversion": ["King Dedede", "Kirby", "Meta Knight"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic782063_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box<br/><br/>Float, jump, and battle through eight huge worlds as Kirby takes on a diabolical band of rodent robbers called the Squeaks!<br/><br/><br/>     Mix, match, and make new abilities and items using the Touch Screen.<br/>     Over 25 upgradeable abilities, including new ones like Animal, Bubble, and more!<br/>     Change the world!

The story focuses on three characters, Zo&euml; Castillo, April Ryan, and Kian Alvane, who live in two parallel worlds: technologically advanced Stark and magical Arcadia. April was the protagonist of the first game, while the other two are new characters. The main storyline follows Zo&euml;, a Stark resident who investigates her ex-boyfriend's disappearance and other mysterious occurrences that lead her to April. Meanwhile in Arcadia, April battles the villainous Empire of Azadi while Kian, an elite Azadi soldier, is sent to assassinate her. The game features returning characters from its predecessor, such as Brian Westhouse and Gordon Halloway, but playing The Longest Journey is not a prerequisite to understand its plot.<br/><br/>"}, "76169": {"videogame": ["Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar", "Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords", "Galactic Civilizations II: Twilight of the Arnor"], "poll": [], "name": "Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK Windows Edition", "US Windows Edition", "Windows Digital Download Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic810710.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Galactic Civilizations"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "41", "videogamedeveloper": ["Stardock Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["4x Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "7.81707", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Kalypso Media", "Stardock Entertainment", "Strategy First"], "videogamecompilation": ["Space Unlimited Compilation", "Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar", "Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords", "Galactic Civilizations II: Twilight of the Arnor"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic810710_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the Ultimate Edition CD case<br/><br/>Lead humanity in a struggle to dominate the galaxy in Galactic Civilizations: Ultimate Edition, a 4X strategy game where you use whatever means necessary: technological advancement, economic might, cultural expansion and military prowess to survive the hostile intergalactic war.<br/><br/><br/>     Includes both the original, multiple award winning Galactic Civilizations and the Altarian Prophecy expansion pack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Multi-threaded AI that is as sophisticated and challenging as real life politics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Multiple paths to victory: Military strength, economic might, cultural dominance, or political power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Map, Scenario and Campaign Editors allow players to design their own galaxies.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "76170": {"poll": [], "name": "Democracy", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Macintosh CD edition", "US Windows CD edition", "US Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "7", "videogameseries": ["Democracy"], "videogametheme": ["Government / Politics"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Positech Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Positech Games", "Red Marble Games", "Tri Synergy", "Zero G Games"], "description": "From Wikipedia<br/><br/>Democracy is a government simulation game that was first developed by Positech Games in 2005, with a sequel released in December 2007.

The game follows the covert activities of Sam Fisher, an agent working for a black-ops branch of the National Security Agency (NSA) called &quot;Third Echelon&quot;. The character, Sam Fisher, is voiced by Michael Ironside...<br/><br/>The gameplay of Pandora Tomorrow is largely unchanged from the original Splinter Cell. The game features some moderate graphical improvements, as well as minor gameplay changes such as the fact that health kits are no longer an inventory item, and the addition of a laser sight to Sam's pistol that allows the player to know exactly where the rounds will strike, even when moving around. Also, Sam can now open doors while carrying a body, shoot while hanging upside down, SWAT turn past doorways unnoticed, and perform a half split jump. The pistol laser was replaced with an OCP and the SWAT turn was removed in Chaos Theory, the next entry in the series. The Playstation 2 and Gamecube versions also feature an additional single player mission to compensate for the abridged gameplay compared to the PC and Xbox versions.<br/><br/>The most significant gameplay change in Pandora Tomorrow is the addition of a multiplayer component to the series in an attempt to take advantage of the features and popularity of Xbox Live. Both the PlayStation 2 and PC versions of the game also come with multiplayer; however, the GameCube version does not. The game pits heavily armed Argus mercenaries against stealthy Shadownet spies. The spies are played from a third-person viewpoint and control similarly to the main game's singleplayer mode, although they have their own unique moves and equipment. The mercenaries are played from a first-person viewpoint, and control more similarly to traditional first-person shooter characters. Although mercenaries have superior firepower, spies have the ability to hide in darkness and ambush or sneak past mercenaries in a number of ways. The total number of players in each multiplayer game is limited to 4. After the release of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory which included a very similar multiplayer mode, Ubisoft took down their multiplayer server for this game due to &quot;low&quot; numbers of players...<br/><br/>"}, "76200": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Dorit Gudd"], "average": "5", "poll": [], "name": "Das grosse Wimmelwelt-Spiel", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Recognition"], "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic832522_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Noris Spiele"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic832522.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Noris first edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game"], "age": "3", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "The game contains six large pictures in which many people and items can be found.

You must work with or against the other survivors to be the last one standing.  No not standing, cowering in the corner crying for their mommy.<br/><br/>In the spirit of AMC's &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, Eaten By Zombies takes you into a dark world of eventual death. Every turn you must venture out from your safehouse and scavenge for Swag. But not so fast, the Undead have other plans for your brains. Every day a Horde of fresh zombies will be waiting for you, and over time the threat gets greater. Now it's time for your &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; instincts to help you to survive just one more day. Using the swag you've got on you (ie cards in you hand) you must survive any way you can.<br/><br/>If you can get away or kill the Horde, you may scavenge the remains of the desolate suburbs for any Swag the neighbors may have left behind.   With the right stuff and a few good friends to out run, you may just make it through this alive... well, no probably not.  But being the last one to die a slow, painful death means you can claim sole victory!<br/><br/>With a set of over thirty different cards to start with, no two games will ever be alike. This game is a combination of Card Drafting, Hand Management and Survival Horror with a few dirty tricks thrown in.<br/><br/>Game Play/Mechanics <br/>You start with five heavy sticks (each worth +1 fight) and five hide cards (each +1 flee) as well as two sandwiches (+1 Flee &amp; Draw one card).  You shuffle these 12 cards and draw 6 into your hand.  You then face one of the 25 zombies from the Zombie Deck with a fight value ranging from 1-8 and a flee value of 1-4.  You must announce Fight or Flee and then proceed to play some/all of your 6 cards in your hand.<br/><br/>If you successfully fight/flee you then take the total fight/flee value to the scavenging portion of your turn (think of it as a &quot;buy&quot;) where you acquire items such as Shotguns, fists full of ammo, crowbar, binoculars, fire on a stick, grandma pantry, deadeye or other cards which you then put INTO YOUR HAND for use in the very next turn and draw back up to 6 cards from your draw deck.  Played cards go to your discard pile, including any zombies you have succeeded in killing.<br/><br/>If you flee then the zombie card goes to the zombie discard pile.  As you draw zombies into your hand (from shuffling your discard pile) you are stuck with them in your hand forever unless you play them into the zombie horde attacking on another player's turn, so the zombie horde gets tougher over time.<br/><br/>If you are unsuccessful in killing/fleeing then you must lose a number of cards equal to the flee value of the horde.  These lost cards come from either your hand or as a blind draw off the top of your draw pile and go back to the scavenging area, weakening you.  If you run out of cards you succumb to your wounds and become a zombie, now trying to kill the other players on each turn.<br/><br/>If a player ever ends up with six zombie cards in his/her hand the zombie players win as the remaining players have gone insane.  Each time the zombie deck is gone through and reshuffled you add one more zombie to the horde for the rest of the game, making perpetual survival impossible.<br/><br/>It isn't a matter of if you're going to die but when.  Be the last player standing and win.

The nemesis in the game was named Mental Block, and his goal was to stifle the world's imagination, causing rampant boredom.<br/><br/>Zool 2 added the option to play as Zool's female counterpart, Zooz. The two characters played similarly, although there were some subtle differences in their abilities. Most notably, Zool could destroy parts of the scenery that Zooz couldn't, and vice versa, resulting in a slightly different route through the level. The sequel, like the original, also featured several mini games. The most common was a version of Breakout which used Zool's two-headed pet dog as a paddle.<br/><br/>The game also received generally high review scores, but did not make an impact the way its predecessor had despite arguably being the better game as the difficulty level had been curbed and the controls were more responsive. A possible reason for the game's relative lack of attention was that by this stage the system that Zool was most associated with, the Amiga, was in decline as a gaming format.<br/><br/>The Amiga remained the lead format for the second game, but unlike the first it was not widely converted.

Would the three Musketeers have had any adventures had they not become agents of the Queen and run afoul of the politics of Richelieu? Would the dark games of Dangerous Liaisons have been so devious without the civility of court? Could the Count of Monte Cristo have truly gained revenge without gaining social power?<br/><br/>This book is a mixed bag of systems and details to help you expand on life in the courts of Th&eacute;ah. It adds new rules and abilities for courtly characters that will leave the swordsmen in their wake at social occasions.<br/><br/>We begin with &lsquo;The Courts of Th&eacute;ah', an introduction to life in the Thean court. This article details courtly life and the positions and titles that can be acquired by the ambitious. This is followed by detail on fashion in Th&eacute;ah. This article helps you dress your characters for court and figure out what they are wearing and how to repair the sword holes. The next article is an optional system to expand reputation. The system has come under criticism in the past, so this small expansion should help make more sense of character's renown. Then for the courtiers we present social combat rules. This system allows courtly characters to trade wit with deadly masters of sarcasm for reputation. However, take care, in Th&eacute;ah words can kill as surly as a blade. Finally we present two articles originally published in Valkyrie magazine, but updated and revised for this book. D&eacute;licatesse is a new sword school suitable for courtly ladies, and Mirage reveals the secrets of one of the three lost bargainers' arts. So welcome to court, but take care. Every move is watched, every lie examined and each breach of etiquette can mean ruin.<br/><br/>"}, "76273": {"rpgartist": ["Carl Frank"], "rpg": ["7th Sea", "Swashbuckling Adventures"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Island of Kanuba", "rpgdesigner": ["Kevin Wilson"], "rpgproducer": ["Mark Stanton Woodward"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic768781.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgsetting": ["Th\u00e9ah"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Swashbuckling / Pirates)", "Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic768781_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>User summary<br/><br/>The Island of Kanuba is a free supplement for 7th Sea and Swashbuckling Adventures.<br/><br/><br/>From the file's introduction<br/><br/>The world of Th&eacute;ah is more diverse than seven nations, more potent than six warring pirate fleets, and larger than any four prophets.

Both that movie and that game aren&rsquo;t steam punk, but \\ they are about a speculative future. A future from the past&rsquo;s point of view.<br/><br/>And so, this game is about just that: how the past thought the future would look like.<br/><br/>But it&rsquo;s also about a little more. I talked with Ro and found out exactly what she liked about those kinds of stories. After our talk, I discovered she really liked four key themes.<br/><br/>The first was Action! She loved the high danger and suspense she found in those stories.<br/><br/>The second was Science! She loved the technology people from the past thought we would come up with.<br/><br/>The third was Mystery! Ro loves Victorian mysticism and so we had to throw in some of that.<br/><br/>And lastly, Ro loves Romance! Characters like the roaring &lsquo;20&rsquo;s dilettante and the Victorian Adventuress were high on her list, so we had to include something for them.<br/><br/>From there, I just made stats for each of the things Ro loved and provided a way for the players to create a character based on those four themes. Then, I threw the game at a few game design folks I respect and admire and found out what they thought of it. They gave a few suggestions and the game really started taking shape.<br/><br/>And so here is Ro&rsquo;s game.

Valid bids are suits and no trump. No trump means that there is no trump suit and Aces are the high card for each suit. Each player bids once, with the person to the left of the dealer starting and the dealer ending the bidding round. Whoever has the highest bid starts the first hand.<br/><br/>Play starts with the starting player playing one card face up. Following players must follow suit if they can, otherwise, they can play any card they want. High card takes the trick and dictates who starts the next hand. Play continues until all cards have been played (each player will have 8 cards).<br/><br/>Each team counts the number of tricks they took during the round. The team that won the bid must have at least the number of tricks they bid to score. Otherwise, they lose the number of points bid (if they bid 4 and only took 3 tricks, they lose 4 points). It is possible to have a score in the negatives. The non-bidding team scores a point for each trick they took.<br/><br/>Teams can bid lone hands, requiring them to take all 8 tricks. If they do, they can score extra points. If they don't they will lose those points.<br/><br/>After each player has dealt twice, the game is over.

It is the first game in the Jagged Alliance series, and was followed by Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games (1995) and Jagged Alliance 2 (1999).<br/><br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Jagged Alliance takes place on the fictional south Atlantic island of Metavira, a former nuclear testing site. The nuclear tests altered some trees on the island, and several years later it was discovered by a scientist, Brenda Richards, that those trees, known as Fallow trees, produce unique sap that prove to be a medical marvel. However, Brenda also discovered that the trees could not reproduce. Her assistant, Lucas Santino, realized how profitable this sap would be and managed to convince Jack Richards, the leader of the scientific mission, that it would be beneficial to have two independent science teams, and consequently established a new base on the other side of the island. He immediately began to recruit new people and gradually took over the island by force.<br/><br/>When the game begins, the player is contacted by Jack Richards and is invited to the island. There, Brenda and her father request that the player hires mercenaries through the Association of International Mercenaries (abbreviated in-game as 'A.I.M.') to reclaim the island from Santino&rsquo;s forces sector by sector.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The player starts the game and every following day in a room. Here the player can load and save the game, change settings, hire new mercenaries or sleep until the next day.<br/><br/><br/>Map screen<br/><br/>When the player starts a new day he is transferred to a screen displaying Metavira on a square grid. The map includes information such as the number of Fallow trees in each sector, whether the sector is enemy or player controlled, how many guards and tappers are in a sector, and the terrain information. The player can also decide what mercenaries and equipment to take and what player-owned sector to start from.<br/><br/>Mercenaries, guards, and tappers need to be paid; if needed, the player can raise the guards' and tappers' salaries to make them happier. Mercenaries can be left at the base to either heal, train skills, or repair items. Occasionally, Jack or Brenda Richards contact the player with an important objective, such as securing a clean water source. These requests can be ignored, but usually cause some kind of hindrance to the player at a later date.<br/><br/><br/>Tactical screen<br/><br/>When the player has chosen the mercenaries and equipment to take to the mission, he is taken to the sector he chose earlier overseeing his mercenaries from a top-down viewpoint. The player can now directly command his chosen mercenaries and issue movement orders. The player may move his troops to the adjacent sector. Traveling to an enemy controlled sector initiates combat. Player is limited to a single save slot during the day.<br/><br/>When player characters and enemies are in the same sector, the game switches to turn-based play. Both sides take turns to move and perform actions, which uses their action points. The number of action points is determined by the character's attributes. Interrupts are possible. Mercenaries can also crouch to make themselves a smaller target or take cover behind objects. It is possible to walk backwards and move stealthily so the mercenary can avoid being noticed by the enemy, though both of these actions uses more action points than normal moving.<br/><br/>When attacking, there is a certain chance that the mercenary will hit. The chance to hit is also affected by the amount of action points the player uses to aim. Attacks can be done in a wide variety of ways, using firearms, close combat weapons like knives, throwing weapons such as hand grenades and explosive devices like land mines. When the day ends mercenaries return to the base for sleep. The day can also end during a battle and mercenaries might suffer additional injuries as they retreat from the enemy sector. The sector is conquered when all the enemies are killed or is lost when all the player's mercenaries, guards and tappers are killed.<br/><br/><br/>Characters<br/><br/>The main characters in the game are the hireable mercenaries along with other NPCs, such as the player's employers Jack and Brenda Richards, and the main antagonist, Lucas Santino. There are also four native characters that might be offered to the player as guides. The player can only control the mercenaries. Guards, tappers and enemies are controlled by the AI.<br/><br/><br/>Mercenaries<br/><br/>There are 60 hireable mercenaries and the player can recruit up to eight mercenaries at a time. Some mercenaries will refuse to join at start, as they want to see if the player can be trusted to lead them.<br/><br/>Every mercenary has four attributes - health, agility, dexterity, wisdom, and four skills - medical, explosives, mechanical and marksmanship. Health determines the amount damage a mercenary can take, agility determines how many action points they have, dexterity helps in using weapons and other items in their various conditions, wisdom enables mercenaries to get experience quicker, medical helps to heal wounded characters, explosives helps to disarm bombs and activate the mercenary's own explosives, mechanical helps to pick locks and combine items together and marksmanship helps to get a better aim and shot on enemies. The mercenaries employed by the player gain experience from the actions they perform. For example, a mercenary that bandages a wound might improve his medical skill. Mercenaries may also permanently lose attribute points from an injury. For example, a hit in the head might reduce mercenary's wisdom or a hit in the leg might reduce his agility.<br/><br/>Additionally, every mercenary has an experience level that determines how much he gets paid; and when a new level is obtained they demand a raise that the player either has to agree to, or lose the mercenary.<br/><br/>Each character has a number of health points. When a mercenary is injured he slowly bleeds losing health points; bandaging the wound stops the bleeding. This gives the mercenary temporary 'bandage points' that change back to health points over time, but may be quickly lost if the mercenary is injured again.<br/><br/>Each mercenary has a unique personality. There are several characters that are not fond of certain other mercenaries, and can decline joining the player's team for this reason. Some characters can still be hired but will later complain about the other mercenary. Either mercenary may leave the player's group during the night and is shown to be missing on the A.I.M. site. There are also stubborn characters that might refuse to move until an enemy they were targeting has been killed or the enemy moves out of the mercenary's line of sight.<br/><br/><br/>Equipment<br/><br/>There is a large variety of items in the game - some of them play a significant role in the plot while others are there for use.<br/><br/>When the player hires a mercenary he arrives with weapons and equipment. The player can equip the mercenary with various body armour, helmets, goggles and radios. There are five different vests in the game that determine how many items the character can carry. There are standard vests that have pockets along with vests with no pockets that act as body armor. The vests with pockets may have two to five pockets and each one can hold either one particular item or a number of identical items like magazines or hand grenades. Mercenaries can also carry things in their hands.<br/><br/>The player can store an unlimited number of items in the base, but has to transport them with the mercenaries from the sectors to the base.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "76380": {"poll": [], "name": "Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games", "videogamemode": ["Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US DOS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1441571.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Jagged Alliance"], "videogametheme": ["Military"], "usersrated": "19", "videogamedeveloper": ["Sir-Tech"], "videogamegenre": ["Tactical Role-Playing Game"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "average": "7.86842", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sir-Tech"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1441571_t.jpg", "description": "Released in 1995, Deadly Games is a DOS sequel to the original game. It features a different format, however, and is considered by some to be more of a spin-off than a sequel. This game features the same engine and top-down perspective as the original game.<br/><br/>In Deadly Games, the player takes a group of mercenaries through a series of missions. The missions are linked chronologically, removing the need for micro-management on a strategic map. The scenario branches somewhat depending on the player's successes and failures. There are multiple terrain types, the mercenaries are hired and fired between missions, and the first equipment trader (Micky) of the series offers his services (occasionally he may sell the player a bunch of equipment that turns out to be junk prompting the mercs to exclaim &quot;Micky just gave us the deep six!&quot;).<br/><br/>The most innovative aspects of Deadly Games include a wide variety of special ops mission types like hostage rescues, demolition and infiltration missions. Strategic features like turn limits and a boosted AI as well as networked multiplayer capabilities make this the most complete package in the series. The integrated scenario and campaign editors allow for the creation of custom strategic scenarios, adding to the replay value. Merc weapons can be modified by adding scopes, silencers and barrel extenders. Heavier equipment such as grenade launchers and mortars are available as well.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "76381": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF"], "statistics": [], "name": "Robots", "rpghonor": ["2004 Indie RPG Awards - Best Free Game - Runner Up"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic769594.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgdesigner": ["Rob Kenrick"], "average": "6", "rpggenre": ["Comedy / Satire", "Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Steampower Publishing"], "rpg": ["Robots"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic769594_t.jpg", "description": "Also known as: Roleplaying Game Designate: Robots<br/><br/>Publisher's description:<br/><br/>Crush humanity for free courtesy of Steampower Publishing<br/><br/>The puny meat sacks in charge at Steampower Publishing have been replaced by shiny new robot overlords.

You get an extra two dice for any rolls in which your Virtue or Opposed Vice come into play, and two dice will oppose you when facing your Secret Vice.<br/><br/>You should discuss your Blessings and Vices with the GM, who has final say on their appropriateness. Virtues should not be too broad, and Vices should not be too narrow. &quot;Inspires all others to Goodness&quot; is far to broad a Virtue. &quot;Sneers at others when nobody is looking&quot; is far to narrow a vice.<br/><br/>Then go around the circle and introduce yourselves. &quot;Hi, I'm John Jones, and I humbly worship our Lord.

I heard of the project a while ago and thought it was a great way of trying out new RPG ideas. The motivation/inspiration for this particular game came out of a number of things: (1) liking Ars Magica, but getting tired of the complexity and enormous amounts of bookkeeping required by the system; (2) wondering what an Ars game would look like set in modern times, (3) the &quot;high die&quot; version of Risus: The Anything RPG, and (4) a game like The Pool that gives more power to the players. And here's the result, such as it is.  I wasn't able to do everything I wanted to; in particular, I started writing it as a &quot;traditional&quot; RPG with the assumption of only one GM - with the intention of going back and writing in an option for more player power - but then I ran out of time! Such is life, I guess.<br/><br/>It's the best I could do in 24 hours. One thing I learned from the experience: I'm no longer 18; these days, getting only 3 hours of sleep adversely - and noticeably - affects my overall state of well being. <br/><br/>Of course, I'd very much appreciate knowing what you think about this attempt, and any advice you have on any aspect of the game; in particular, do you think it's worth my making a Beta version of it?<br/><br/>"}, "76415": {"poll": [], "name": "Hogan's Alley", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["English/European NES edition", "eShop Wii U Downloadable edition", "JP Famicom edition", "US Arcade edition", "US NES edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1060372.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "videogamefranchise": ["NES Black Box (1980s NES Games, US)"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Intelligent Systems", "Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Light Gun Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "NES", "Wii U"], "usersrated": "26", "average": "5.73654", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1060372_t.jpg", "description": "[Wikipedia: <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogan%27s_Alley_%28video_game%29' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogan%27s_Alley_%28video_game%2...</a>]<br/><br/>Hogan's Alley is a 1984 arcade game by Nintendo.

The idea behind this exercise (based on Scott Mcloud's 24hr comic) is to complete a 24 page RPG in 24 hours (although the 24 page rule, like chivalry, seems to be more of a vague ideal than a reality for most designers).<br/><br/>When I began I decided that I wanted to play with a few themes that keep recurring in my ideas; micro-epic scale, lighthearted fun, and gestalt play. Micro-epic was a word coined by a friend of mine to describe shows such as Hercules and Xena. Where kingdoms often seemed to consist of a few hundred people at most and entirely different cultures always seemed a few days walk away. I added some inspiration from the comics Gear by Doug Tennapel and Tales of the Beanworld by Larry Marder that have been rattling around in my subconscious for years looking for an exit and also the &quot;Beer &amp; Pretzels&quot; fun of Ninja Burger and Kobolds ate my baby by 9th Level Games. Halfway through I also realized that two other strong inspirations were forcing their way in, one in the form of the painfully addictive web game Kingdom of Loathing, and the other from Creeks and Crawdads a beloved game of my youth (and the first I was aware of to use the beer &amp; pretzels label).<br/><br/>I took all these sources, dumped them into the blender of sleep deprivation and procrastination, and here you see the results. I consider this draft of the game a failure. While it could technically be called a game it is missing a lot of what I wanted to put in it and the remainder is clunky and inelegant. Several pages were deleted in a fit of annoyance at how little they resembled what was forming in my head, that entire aspect of the game (my favorite) will have to be reworked and rewritten.<br/><br/>I do not however consider the exercise a failure. Poor time management and procrastination were my primary enemies and having fought them under these stresses I feel that I have gained a better understanding of these weaknesses and in the future will be more prepared to deal with them. Also several good ideas were given a voice (albeit a muffled voice, possibly in Esperanto) and I think I have a pretty darned good game in its embryonic state. This was fun and challenging<br/>and frustrating and I can't wait to do it again!<br/><br/>"}, "76420": {"videogame": ["Atari Anthology", "Atari: 80 Classic Games in One"], "poll": [], "name": "Combat", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["Android (Atari Greatest Hits Atari 2600 Emulation) edition", "English/European Atari 2600 edition", "North American Atari 2600 (Picture Label) edition", "North American Atari 2600 (Sears Tele-Games) edition", "North American Atari 2600 (Text Label) edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784087.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Flight", "Military", "War - Modern", "War - World War I", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "51", "videogamedeveloper": ["Atari, Inc.", "Code Mystics"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "Atari 2600"], "average": "5.87745", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atari, Inc.", "Sears"], "videogamecompilation": ["Atari Anthology", "Atari Flashback Classics: Volume 2", "Atari Vault", "Atari: 80 Classic Games in One"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784087_t.jpg", "description": "Combat is an early video game by Atari for the Atari 2600.

The player is represented by a red, yellow, and green character resembling a ladybug  while the enemy insects' appearance varies by level. The border of the maze acts as timer, with each circuit signaling the release of an enemy insect from the central area, up to (generally) a maximum of four. The speed of the circuit increases on stages 2 and 5.<br/><br/>Unlike the more famous Pac-Man, the player can alter the layout of the maze by shifting any of the twenty green gates. It is not possible to completely isolate a portion of the maze through gate-shifting.<br/><br/>When the fourth enemy insect enters the maze, the central area will show a level-specific vegetable. Eating a vegetable gives the player bonus points and immobilizes the enemy insects for several seconds, though touching them is still lethal. The skull icons are lethal to ladybugs and enemy insects. An enemy insect who dies returns to the central area. Once a vegetable is eaten, the central area will remain empty unless an enemy insect dies and is re-released, revealing a new vegetable. A ladybug who dies will shrink from view and be briefly replaced with icons resembling the stereotypical wings and halo of an angel.<br/><br/>The colors of the hearts and letters cycle through a short red, a middling yellow, and a longer blue. The point values are as follows:<br/><br/>* Dot: 10 points (20, 30, or 50 points with appropriate multiplier)<br/>    * Blue letter/heart: 100 points (200, 300, or 500 points with appropriate multiplier)<br/>    * Yellow letter/heart: 300 points (600, 900, or 1500 points with appropriate multiplier)<br/>    * Red letter/heart: 800 points (1600, 2400, or 4000 points with appropriate multiplier)<br/>    * Vegetable: Starts at 1000 points, rises by 500 with each level till 9500. The highest vegetable is horseradish, on the 18th level. After the 18th level, the horseradish repeats itself, and is of the same value.<br/><br/>If a heart is consumed while it is blue, a point multiplier will come into effect, indicated by the blue section in the upper right corner of the screen. The first blue heart doubles all point values, the second triples them and the third quintuples them. This multiplier lasts until the level is complete. Eating hearts while they are yellow or red offers no benefit beyond the points collected.<br/><br/>At each level, the maze will contain three letters. One will be randomly selected from the set of {S, P, C, I, L} (which appear only in SPECIAL), one will be randomly selected from the set of {X, T, R} (which appear only in EXTRA) and the third will be an A or an E (which appear in both words). A secondary goal of the player is to complete the words SPECIAL (indicated in red in the top left corner) and EXTRA (in yellow at top center). If, for example, a letter S is consumed while it is red, the corresponding letter in the word SPECIAL will change from grey to red. Eating an S while it is any other color (or if the S in SPECIAL is already red) offers no benefit beyond the points collected. Completing the word SPECIAL rewards the player with a free game, while completing EXTRA gives the player an extra life. Completing either word causes all its letters to return to normal and immediately advances the player to the next level. In the ColecoVision version, completing SPECIAL puts the player into a bonus level (known in-game as a &quot;Vegetable Harvest&quot;) where the goal is to consume as many randomly-placed vegetables as possible within a fixed time. The SPECIAL register does not appear in the Intellivision version.<br/><br/>[From Wikipedia: <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Bug_%28arcade_game%29' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Bug_%28arcade_game%29</a>]<br/><br/>"}, "76436": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic772869.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Bismarck"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jack Greene"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1980", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["Jean Baer", "Claus Bergen", "Bob Haynes", "Mick (Mike) Uhl"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Avalon Hill"], "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic772869_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Nautical", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Avalon Hill's (AH) Bismarck 1979/80 edition, designed by Jack Greene, is a totally different game from the AH 1962 edition designed by Lindsley Schutz and Charles Roberts.<br/><br/>The game centered around the hunt for the KMS Bismarck and the KMS Prinz Eugen in mid-1941. The game has some similarities to game Battleship, with both players having a hidden map-board and calling out coordinates to locate their opponent.<br/><br/>There are two players, German and British. The British player has the arduous task of placing the large number of Royal Navy vessels and search aircraft on his map-board before game play begins. Each map-board is on a grid, with letters on one axis, and numbers on the other. Each Royal Navy unit has a historically accurate starting point. The German setup takes but a moment, since the Germans have only a few bomber units and the task force with Bismarck and Prinz Eugen to place on their map.<br/><br/>Each turn, the players move their respective units (cardboard counters), searching for enemy units, and possibly engaging in combat. In the vast spaces of the Bering Sea and North Atlantic, the search phase becomes vital. Each player calls out grid coordinates containing a ship or aircraft, and the opponent indicates whether a ship is located there, and if so what type. A player may choose not to search with a particular unit, thus keeping its location secret (common tactic for German player, obviously). Since the Bismarck is the only enemy Battleship on the map, British discovery of her is key to victory. As the British are unlikely to have a force sufficient to sink the Bismarck when they initially find her, they will need to &quot;shadow&quot; the mighty vessel. A fast unit, such as the Heavy Cruiser Suffolk, is able to keep up with Bismarck and follow her on radar without engaging in combat.<br/><br/>Eventually, British heavy units, such as the Battlecruiser Hood may be vectored into the same square as the German Task Force. At this point combat ensues. The British also have air units on the Aircraft Carriers Victorious and Ark Royal which can both search for the Germans and attack with torpedoes from a distance. The game has combat damage sheets with squares representing areas of each warship that can be damaged in combat. As combat is resolved, squares are checked off.<br/><br/>The Germans win by avoiding contact with the British, successfully &quot;breaking out&quot; into the Atlantic and ravaging merchant shipping there. They can also achieve victory by destroying any opposition they encounter and making their way to a friendly port in occupied France. Historically, either scenario would have grave consequences for the Battle of the Atlantic. The British have a tougher task, needing to intercept and destroy the Germans. Since most British vessels are no match for Bismarck, it is necessary to vector several vessels currently on convoy escort duties in the area to form a powerful task force. Poor planning by the British or clever moves by the Germans allow Bismarck to slip through.<br/><br/>The advanced rules of the game implement a weather system, combat using a miniatures-type system (with ship counters laid out on the floor), realistic damage to ships, etc. Alternate &quot;what if&quot; scenarios and ships are provided, such as the German Aircraft Carrier Graf Zeppelin, breakout with the Tirpitz and others. U-boats are also represented (albeit in an abstract way) in the Advanced game.<br/><br/>Second edition changes included:<br/><br/>     the square grid on the original map was replaced with a  hexagonal brick grid overlay;  <br/>     the single Bismarck ship unit was replaced by multiple German ships; <br/>     the relatively simple search, movement and combat systems of the original were replaced by much more complex rules. (Indeed, many considered the rules changes ponderous and detrimental to gameplay.)<br/>     packaging was modified, second edition coming in a smaller, standard-sized AH flat box (compared to the over-sized box of the first edition) and having alternative cover artwork.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Avalon Hill edition"], "name": "Bismarck (second edition)", "playingtime": "240", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "average": "6.88844", "usersrated": "128", "age": "0"}, "76437": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bill Bridges", "Steve Brown", "Phil Brucato", "Brian Campbell", "Sam Chupp", "Andrew C.

A variety of challenging jumps await. The exciting Perfect Stride horse game starts now! You and up to three competitors play skilled riders. Be ready for the unexpected -- sometimes lucky events occur and sometimes trouble comes your way. Collect the most ribbons to win the game!&quot;<br/><br/>The jump course, made up of up to 10 jumps or obstacles is determined by randomly placing (face down) up to 10 Jump cards in a row.  The game contains a total of 20 Jump so chances are, your course will be different every time you play.<br/><br/>In Perfect Stride, game play occurs in two phases.<br/>During the &quot;Set the Pace&quot; phase, all players secretly choose the speed at which they move their horse and simultaneously reveal that speed.  This determines the order in which the players will attempt the upcoming jump and how many Skill cards they are allowed to draw.  Skill cards will be used during the &quot;Jump&quot; phase to successfully clear the newly revealed jump ahead.  Rider Jump Order may also affect the outcome of other events which will occur.  The rider in the lead receives the Lead Rider Token and jumps first and can gain bonus points for keeping the lead BUT the faster you ride, the fewer Skill cards you draw.  The lead rider also reveals the next jump during the next game phase.<br/><br/>Players then draw their Skill cards and the Jump Phase begins.  Each rider in Rider Jump Order, makes an attempt to successfully clear the jump ahead by playing skill cards and activating special card functions.  In addition, unknown events will occur (from the Event card deck) which will affect a riders attempt.  Those that successfully clear the jump win Ribbon Points.  The order in which riders clear the jump determines how many ribbon points they win.  The Lead Rider Token may change hands many times during the Jump phase and the rider who is in the lead at the end of the Jump phase will gain bonus ribbons.<br/><br/>Perfect Stride is a game with many levels of strategy with just the right amount of luck blended in.  How fast should I ride?  Who is in the lead?  Should I sacrifice my draw to get ahead of other Riders?  Should I save specific Skill cards to use later on?  When should I take the lead from another rider?

Well, more accurately, war is gone. Humanity still bickers as usual, but any violence - any - is forbidden. The otherworld visitors ensured that.<br/><br/>They visited Earth just once, and only stayed 24 hours. In that time (while artillery splashed uselessly against them and nuclear weapons somehow failed to go off), they stated that Earth might one day be admitted to the Galactic Federation and, until that time, we would be Monitored.<br/><br/>They are gone, but their invisible Monitors remain. No one has yet figured out how they work, but the process is simple. Think whatever you want, but as soon as you move to potentially injure another person, *pop*. You and the target are suddenly unconscious for 30 seconds. Try again, same result.<br/><br/>Try to hit someone with a car, and *pop*, you wake with the car stopped and both of you laying still. 30 seconds is lost.<br/><br/>It is simply impossible to do violence against another. The invisible Monitors are infallible. They stop accidents, they stop intentional acts. They can tell the difference between roleplay and real. They stop anyone from becoming a victim of violence, pure and simple. Assault, rape, murder, all disappear. Whether the target is awake or asleep, conscious or drugged, informed or not, they never fail in their judgement.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, this meant boxing still survives as a sport.<br/><br/>Faced with no more threat of violence, there's... not much change. There are still economic realities. Someone has to man the factories, someone has to own them. People still need laws for social order, even if cops are reduced to ticket-writing.<br/><br/>And people still crave power. This is your world, one where influence and reputation are the coin of the land. Sure, cash is nice, but with the leveling of the field by the Monitors, there are massive upheavals. Cops can't arrest people - if they resist, both Cop and target go under. Theft is a problem, for if it doesn't involve violence, well, what stops it? Protests are safer with no fear of arrests or thugs. Change is easier.<br/><br/>But corporations whose products kill people, a lot of people start losing 30 seconds at a time. The Monitors take a big picture. If you approved a product and it kills someone, well, you get 30 seconds out of the loop. Each person in the decision chain gets it for each person that dies. Frankly, some tobacco executives aren't expected to be conscious ever again. And the remaining CEOs and middle managers, they're now looking at the human cost of products again.<br/><br/>This is a world where no means no, where you can't stop anyone from doing what they want. It's also a world where, on a whim, you can steal 30 seconds from someone. It's a world where money still exists, but decisions always come back to you. Yeah, the tricky could pay someone to steal 30 seconds from someone else, but it'll happen to them too.<br/><br/>In a world running under an twisted golden rule, how will you get to the top?<br/><br/>"}, "76440": {"videogame": ["Capcom Classics Collection Remixed", "Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1", "Final Fight: Double Impact"], "poll": [], "name": "Final Fight", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["eShop Wii U Downloadable edition", "European Mega CD edition", "Japanese Mega CD edition", "UK Amstrad edition", "UK ZXS edition", "US Amiga edition", "US Arcade edition", "US Atari ST edition", "US Atari ST edition", "US C64 edition", "US GBA edition", "US Sega CD Edition", "US SNES edition", "Wii U Virtual Console (SNES) edition", "Wii Virtual Console (SNES) edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554494.png", "videogameseries": ["Final Fight"], "videogametheme": ["Crime"], "usersrated": "64", "videogamecharacter": ["Guy (Final Fight)", "Poison", "Sodom"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Amstrad CPC", "Arcade", "Atari ST", "Commodore 64", "Game Boy Advance", "SEGA CD", "Sharp X68000", "SNES", "Wii", "Wii U", "ZX Spectrum"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Guy (Final Fight)", "Poison (Final Fight)", "Sodom"], "average": "6.58281", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd.", "SEGA Corporation", "U.S. Gold Ltd"], "videogamecompilation": ["Capcom Classics Collection Remixed", "Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1", "Final Fight: Double Impact"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1554494_t.png", "description": "Final Fight\u200b (\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c8?) is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up game originally released by Capcom as a coin-operated video game in 1989.

They can steal items from the store, slack off, or keep performing their work duties. Each activity has risks and rewards. The player scores points after successfully slacking off and after taking their stolen goods to their locker. When a player gets caught (by the boss) doing something wrong they gain heat. Heat also naturally rises during the game. When a player reaches 30 they are fired. The game ends when all of the players but one are fired or the event deck is exhausted.<br/><br/>Five Fingered Severance is a take that game. To gain points the players will have to open themselves up to the other player's attacks. I want the game to be more tactical though, so the plot cards in the deck are limited to just a few types of cards.

Nearly 400 pages long, it's written by Greg Stolze, creator of the One-Roll Engine, co-author of Wild Talents, Godlike, and Unknown Armies, and author of Reign: A Game of Lords and Leaders.<br/><br/>Progenitor is a superhero setting about big ideas. A single woman gains inconceivable power then unwittingly passes it on to a handful of people. They pass it along to others in turn, and so on, and soon thousands of men and women around the world share that strange power in different forms.<br/><br/>Some of them use their powers for their own personal gain or gratification. Others try to help those around them. Others change the world itself.<br/><br/>What will your characters do with that kind of power?<br/><br/>History Is In Your Hands<br/><br/>Progenitor features a deep alternate history, exploring the shape of the world as we knew it and the changes that are wrought by metahumans year by year.<br/><br/>Dozens of characters described in great detail, plus the world-spanning movements and new nations that they establish.<br/><br/>Detailed rules allow you to change history as you go, guided by four broad metrics: Suspicion, Technology, Economy and Warfare. Which metrics are most dominant set the tone for international culture. A &quot;one roll&quot; chart generates major developments year by year that can be built into new scenarios and entire campaigns.<br/><br/>Other rules describe gadgeteers' effects on society according to the &quot;metrics&quot; of social change.<br/><br/>There are rules for &quot;syntergenics,&quot; memes crafted by activists with superhuman intelligence to affect human behavior with an image and change the world with an idea.<br/><br/>There is endless room for player characters to change the world around them using the new rules, to react to changes worked by rivals and enemies, or to simply try to carry out their lives as the pressures around them build.<br/><br/>Progenitor began as a thread on RPG.net, where Greg came up with the idea and developed it in detail. He also posted reports from a playtest campaign. Those should give a sense of one way to approach the setting. But it's much, much bigger than that.<br/>To the Brink and Back<br/><br/>Progenitor tracks the history of the world from 1968 to 1999: From the moment the Progenitor, Amanda Sykes, gains her incredible powers to her strange departure from the global scene. Beyond that, the world is each individual GM's to build and explore using the rules in the book.<br/><br/>The history of the world of the Progenitor is given in rich detail, divided into three broad sections. First is the Rise of the Progenitor, from 1968 to 1982, when the metahumans spread rapidly and change the world around them, mostly, it seems, for the better.<br/><br/>Then comes the Metapocalypse, when the actions of a single evil metahuman bring the entire world to the brink of destruction.<br/><br/>In the later years the world changes further. Incredible technologies propogate between 1983 and 1999, metahumans around the world take on superheroic personae, and subtle ideas and images conceived by metahumans' impossible intelligence influence individuals and entire nations.<br/><br/>The highly distinctive styles of three brilliant artists illustrate the changes in the world. Todd Shearer's work can be seen in many Arc Dream projects, from Wild Talents Second Edition to the new sourcebooks for Delta Green. Samuel Araya was an illustrator in the first edition of Wild Talents and his work graces Atlas Games' Unknown Armies Second Edition and many of White Wolf's World of Darkness games.

Those outings are open to all members, ex-members, family and friends and so regularly a bunch of artsy people hit the road for a fun day. And it is not that it is planned that way, but invariably something always happens: The last time you visited the museum of ancient history, you got caught up in a standoff between two cursed mummies. The last time you visited the zoo, you had to fight off an escaped gorilla slowly growing to King-Kong size... An invitation to a poetry reading got you mingled up in the persecution of dissident writers in Absurdistan... Hell even something as innocent as a picnic by the lake turned a hair-raising adventure. (Okay you couldn't know that the spot you choose for the campfire was also used as breeding ground of the local variety of the Loch Ness were-turtle... But what the heck, Sh-- happens.)<br/><br/>Anyway, the MAoFA is famous. Its field trips are infamous and it takes a special kind of guy or gal to participate in one of those trips despite all the rumors and warnings. It takes an even more special kind of guy or gal to live through one of these trips and then sign up for the next one.<br/><br/>You are this kind of guy, you are this kind of gal and you just received an invitation for the next field trip.
