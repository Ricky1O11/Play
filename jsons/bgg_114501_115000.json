Zuletzt kamen die Clans aus dem geheimnisvollen Toquine und formten aus all diesen Einfl&uuml;ssen ein neues Reich: Alba!<br/><br/>F&uuml;r Clan und Krone: dieser Wahlspruch spiegelt den Zwiespalt wider, in dem das albische Volk lebt und der immer wieder Anlass f&uuml;r Streit bietet - von Machtk&auml;mpfen im Hohen Rat &uuml;ber heimt&uuml;ckische Intrigen und Meuchelmorde bis zur offenen und blutigen Fehde. Alter Clanadel widersetzt sich den vom K&ouml;nig ernannten neuen Feudalherren, machtbewusste Kirchenf&uuml;rsten neiden der Bruderschaft des Tr&auml;umers ihren Einfluss, reiche St&auml;dte streben nach mehr Unabh&auml;ngigkeit, und alle buhlen um die Gunst des jungen K&ouml;nigs - oder hoffen auf seinen vorzeitigen Tod.<br/><br/>Doch nicht nur die Streitigkeiten der M&auml;chtigen bietet Stoff f&uuml;r Abenteuer. Abseits der St&auml;dte und der wohlhabenden F&uuml;rstent&uuml;mer gibt es wilde und ungez&auml;hmte Orte in Alba - in der Einsamkeit des Hochlands und der S&uuml;mpfe, in den schroffen Grenzgebirgen und in den Tiefen des Waldes, vor allem des Zauberwaldes Broceliande mit seinen Elfenreichen und seinen dunklen, von wilder Magie durchzogenen Winkeln. Dort k&ouml;nnen sich fahrende Ritter und heldenm&uuml;tige Abenteurer mit Geistern wie der Grona oder den Hohlmenschen, mit Ungeheuern wie dem Seeoger oder dem Sumpfkraken und mit Unholden wie dem Trollk&ouml;nig, dem Riesen vom Maedenstor oder der Schwarzen Annis messen und so selbst Teil der vielen Sagen und Mythen werden, die die Barden an albischen H&ouml;fen erz&auml;hlen.<br/>Dieses Quellenbuch enth&auml;lt Hintergrundmaterial zum K&ouml;nigreich Alba. Neben der Beschreibung von Land und Leuten, ihren Sitten und Gebr&auml;uchen und ihrem Glauben bietet das Buch landestypische Abenteurer und magische Artefakte, wichtige Pers&ouml;nlichkeiten, ein umfangreiches Kapitel &uuml;ber das Halfdal und die Lebensweise der Halblinge Midgards.

Later, the wealth of the forests attracted Valian settlers, and waelian pirates built their bases on the coasts, while the dwarfs and Artross doggedly defended their independence. Finally, the clans came from the mysterious Toquin and formed from all these influences, a new realm: Alba!<br/><br/>For Clan and Crown: this motto reflects the discord in the lives of the albian people and is a source of controversy - of struggles for power in the council over treacherous intrigues and assassinations to open and bloody feud. Old clan nobility opposes the new feudal lords appointed by the king, powerful princes of the church envy the Brotherhood of the dreamer's influence, rich cities strive for more independence, and all compete for the favor of the young king - or hope to his untimely death.<br/><br/>But not only disputes of the powerful feature adventures. Away from the cities and the wealthy principalities there are wild and untamed places in Alba - in the solitude of the highlands and swamps, in the rugged border mountains, and in the depths of the forest, especially the magic forest Broceliande his elven kingdoms and his dark corners, crossed by wild magic. There knights errant and heroic adventurers can compete against ghosts as the Grona or the hollow man, with monsters like the Seeoger or swamp octopus and villains such as the Troll King, the giant of Maedenstor or Black Annis and thus become part of the many legends and myths the bards will tell at the albian courts.<br/>This source book contains background material on the Kingdom of Alba.

Players take the roles of War Lords, a race of aliens who have abducted human soldiers from across time in order to build an army to conquer the universe. One player controls the Doctor, who is striving to foil their plans. Players fight each other, capture territory, and form alliances through an engaging, card-based combat system that emphasizes skill and strategy over luck. Eventually though, the Time Lords have to be called in, and the game changes into a fast-paced capture the flag style race to get to the TARDIS and escape before they arrive.<br/><br/>Each turn, players take three actions by playing a card for each action. Playing cards in this way allows players to move, attack other generals and their bases, fortify their bases, or use strong utility actions or delayed tactical responses. The Doctor can influence zone bases to join the Resistance and otherwise interfere with the general's plans.<br/><br/>During play there are several War Chief cards that provide environmental effects when they are face-up. These cards become face-up or face-down due to actions in the game such as forcing another player to be your lieutenant or capturing zones. The game proceeds to the second phase when one player controls the majority of zones or all the War Chief cards are face-up or face-down.<br/><br/>In the second phase of the game, action is faster, as each player plays one action at a time and moves, and doesn't draw any cards to replace their hand. Players fight over the key to the TARDIS and race to escape the world they're on before the Time Lords arrive.<br/><br/>"}, "114822": {"statistics": {}, "name": "100", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"140995": "UK ZX Spectrum Tape Cassette release"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2455": "Abstract"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"4950": "ZX Spectrum"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Puzzle where the player must fill up a 10x10 board  (hence it's name) with numbers.

There are several differences from the original rules, however, that are intended to speed play and optimize simplicity. First, these rules lack a grid. Movement within the virtual environment of cyberspace is conceptual. To convert applications that give &quot;ranges&quot;, simply apply a percentage chance of effectiveness based on range. Second, these rules incorporate the Power attribute from other Fuzion games, essentially the equivalent to a computer's Intelligence from CP2020. Third, the number of CPUs a system uses is irrelevant to these rules and is considered background information.<br/><br/>Although these rules are written for one type of interface (manual or cybernetic), a GM can mix the two by simply specifying which is the standard and apply a -2 to all manual rolls if cybernetic is standard or +2 to all cybernetic rolls if manual is the standard. In addition, these rules assume a 3d6 die-rolling mechanic option of Fuzion. If you're playing Interlock, or the Fuzion option of 1d10, simply replace the 3d6 with a 1d10 die roll and replace all +10 with +d10.

Cyberpunk used a variation of the Interlock system introduced for R.Talsorian's other game, Mekton II. In 1990, the second edition of Cyberpunk, called Cyberpunk 2020, made several changes to its version of Interlock. Almost all of the rules were completely redone and retooled.<br/><br/>R.Talsorian has promised a third edition of Cyberpunk, and with it further changes to the rules. This time around, the rules have also changed names. The Interlock system is now called the Fuzion system, so-named because it introduces elements from another popular game system, the HERO system, and &quot;fuses&quot; the two together. Fuzion, itself, has undergone several variations, similar to its previous Interlock incarnation. Each Fuzion variant is as similar to, and as different from, each other as the Interlock-based as Cyberpunk, Mekton, and Cybergeneration variations of Interlock were. Fuzion offers a lot of customizable options. Using a system of &quot;switches&quot;, allowing certain rules to be &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;; &quot;dials&quot;, allowing settings to be changed from genre to genre; and &quot;plug-ins&quot;, entire rules-sets that may be used in a game at a GM's discretion.<br/><br/>This built-in customization allows Fuzion to be molded, adapted, and modified to fit any genre. The &quot;Core&quot; Fuzion rules, without customization, can do a good job of approximating the feel of most genres, but not very well. Therefore, each Fuzion game must be customized to fit its genre and setting.<br/><br/>CyberFuzion is my attempt to provide a sneak preview of the kinds of changes, modifications, and customizations to expect from the upcoming new edition. This is in an attempt to assuage the fears a lot of Cyberpunk fans have that the next edition will be ruined, and to dispel a lot of misconceptions some have about Fuzion based on rash judgments and plain old stubbornness.<br/><br/>"}, "114840": {"rpgitemversion": {"141029": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fists of Fuzion", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1177076.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"4558": "Fuzion"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"172": "Martial Arts"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1177076_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>This is a system provided for players to design there own or modify existing martial art maneuvers.

Zu seiner Gefolgschaft geh&ouml;ren nicht nur m&auml;chtige Hexen und Finstermagier, sondern auch viele einfache Leute, die sich ihm in der Hoffnung auf ein besseres Leben verschrieben haben. In Alba findet man seine Anh&auml;nger traditionell in der Einsamkeit der W&auml;lder, S&uuml;mpfe und Heidelandschaften, aber in j&uuml;ngster Zeit macht er sich auch in den aufstrebenden St&auml;dten bemerkbar. Erst k&uuml;rzlich wurde Thame durch den feigen Mordanschlag auf den Meister des Sonnenordens in Aufregung versetzt, in dessen Folge mit dem Gr&uuml;nen Sigill ein gef&auml;hrlicher Kreis von Hexen zerschlagen wurde. So wollen es wenigstens der Stadtrat und die Vertreter der Kirgh glauben. Aber vielleicht haben ja einige Samielsj&uuml;nger die Hexenjagd &uuml;berstanden, und selbst, wenn sie alle aufgesp&uuml;rt wurden: das Netz des Gr&uuml;nen J&auml;gers ist weit gespannt, und seine Macht ist ungebrochen.<br/><br/>Dieses Quellenbuch enth&auml;lt Hintergrundmaterial zu Samiel und den ihm verfallenen Hexen. Es beschreibt den Aufbau und das Treiben der Hexenzirkel, an deren Spitze die geheimnisvollen Drei und die sinistre Schattengestalt stehen. M&auml;chtige Zauber der Ritualmagie helfen dem Spielleiter, schwarzen Hexenzirkel in Alba und auch andernorts in Szene zu setzen und sie zu Gegenspielern aufzubauen, mit denen die Abenteurer es immer wieder zu tun bekommen.<br/><br/>Das Abenteuer Die Brut der Kr&ouml;te wirft ein Schlaglicht auf eine Gruppe von Samielsj&uuml;ngern, die in einem abgelegenen Winkel der Gwinelberge insgeheim ihr Unwesen treiben und die Bev&ouml;lkerung eines Bergmannsdorfes unterjochen. Die Abenteurer sto&szlig;en auf ihr &uuml;bles Treiben, w&auml;hrend sie nach ein paar vermissten M&ouml;nchen suchen, die eine heilige Schrift nach Thame bringen sollten. Das Abenteuer steht in lockerem Zusammenhang mit dem Band Das Gr&uuml;ne Sigill.<br/><br/><br/>Translation:<br/><br/>Samiel or the Green Hunter is one of the most intriguing among the Demon Lords of Midgard. To his followers belong not only powerful witches and dark magicians, but also many ordinary people who have succumbed to it in the hope of a better life. In Alba his traditional supporters are found in the solitude of the forests, marshes and moors, but recently he is also noticeable in the emerging cities. Thame was recently alarmed by the cowardly assassination attempt on the master of the Blazing Sun, as a result the Green Sigil, a dangerous circle of witches, was smashed. So it will at least believe the City Council and the representatives of Kirgh. But maybe some followers of Samiel have survived the witch hunt, and even if they were all tracked down: the web of the green hunter is wide, and his power is undiminished.<br/><br/>This source book contains background material on Samiel and the witches captivated by him. It describes the structure and the doings of the covens, which are headed by the mysterious three and the sinister, shadowy figure. Powerful spells and ritual magic help the gamemaster, to set the stage for black coven in Alba and elsewhere and to build up opposing forces, with whom the adventurers will have to deal over and over again.<br/><br/>The adventure the breed of the toad throws a spotlight on a group of followers of Samiel who secretly make mischief in a remote corner of the Gwinel Mountains and subjugate the population of a mountain man village. The adventurers encounter their evil doings, while they search for a few missing monks who should bring a holy book to Thame. The adventure is loosely connected with the band The Green Sigil.<br/><br/>"}, "114848": {"rpgitemversion": {"141039": "PDF Edition 1.0"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Heroic Vehicles", "rpgproducer": {"21898": "Bob Greenwade"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1177072.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"4558": "Fuzion"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1177072_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>This is a Plug-In system for the Fuzion game system, which essentially adapts the Vehicle rules for the HERO System into Fuzion.

The system was called Fantastic Adventure, but I initially decided to call this the T\u0091ran Magic Plug-In, after the world in which that game was set.<br/><br/>T\u0091ra (pronounced TEE-rah) was a world vaguely similar to Earth, though it was decidedly different in many ways. Somewhere in the distant past, some 3000 years ago, an Occurrence had taken place that had altered certain geographical features, destroyed much of the high-tech civilization that existed at the time, and unleashed magic on the world. Those are, in fact, the only details of the Occurrence which survived to the time of the PCs. Elves, Dwarves, and similar people lived among men, as did a number of sentient species that would look to use like anthropomorphized animals. This was a rough-and-tumble world, with as much post-Apocalypse and Wild West to its atmosphere as high fantasy.<br/><br/>And it had its own method for doing magic &mdash; one which cried out for its own system.<br/><br/>At the time, the only way I could see to use such a unique magic system was to create my own game system from the ground up. As it turned out, most of that game&rsquo;s systems stank; only the action-management system (which used an extension of the concepts behind Hero&rsquo;s SPD chart) and the magic system were smooth enough to warrant continued survival.<br/><br/>Now, with Fuzion, one can build sub-systems (aka Plug-Ins) as needed. This, at last, was an opportunity for the Fantastic Adventure magic system to be resurrected without re-launching (not to mention re-creating) the entire system. Of course, some of the specifics needed to be drawn from existing Fuzion plug-ins; where they wouldn&rsquo;t disrupt the &quot;feel&quot; of T\u0091ran magic, rules have been adapted from existing magic and powers Plug-Ins (such as the Power Plug-In from Champions New Millennium, Jason Dour's Heroic Abilities Plug-In, Mark Chase's Atomik Magick, or even the HERO System Rulesbook Fourth Edition!).<br/><br/>Since its origin (and its posting in Beta Format), this Plug-In has been adapted for use in other fantasy worlds, and so a new name has been called for. Part of the original concept was that a &quot;spell&quot; is referred to as a &quot;matrix&quot; (even though in this text it's still called a &quot;spell&quot;), and so this Plug-In is called the Matrix Magic Plug-In.<br/><br/>"}, "114865": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Collapse!

Ever since than I began working on it for about a few hours every few months. I don't know when I will finish this work, most probably never.<br/><br/>PRIME is my futuristic role-playing world. I was inspired by many sci-fi stories and you often can guess which parts are &quot;stolen&quot; from other sources. I do not hide this fact, because nothing in the world is perfectly new and everything is a modification or variation of an older idea, it sometimes just takes longer to identify the origins. Why then did I write a new role-playing background? I do own Battlelords of the 23rd Century, Battletech: Mechwarrior, Mutant Chronicles, Heavy Gear, Shadowrun, Bubblegum Crisis (and others..), I've seen movies like 5th Element, Star Wars, Star Trek and many more, and every world has its ideas, but none was absolutely what I was looking for.<br/><br/>So what am I looking for? In sci-fi I enjoy aliens, a lot of playable alien races, space pirates hiding in asteroid belts, multilateral politics and diplomacy, giant space battles, heroism and adventure. It's LowTech Sci-Fi and Space Opera, not as dark as Fading Suns, not as specialised as Space Gothic. What's LowTech and Space Opera in my eyes: I want a crew right from a curiosity show. I want the ship to be as old as methusalem and as reliable as Winxxxxx5. I want the ship's engineer to take a hammer, slam it against the 'proton-pulse drive', and, whoarr.., it work's. He's the engineer, he knows his job. No tech-talk.<br/><br/>But my main problem was the scale of sci-fi worlds/universes. Did you ever imagine how a space vessel full of pirates should hide in space? By scaling down the gaming world to one star system I feel this problem partly solved. Spaceships do not have to travel light-years to their destiny and by setting several planets into the sun's orbits a ship may as well be intercepted from asteroid fields or nearby planets.<br/><br/>The gaming rules I choose are from the Fuzion system. I did not want to put extra energy in the creation of a new system if there is the perfect one for free. Fuzion is in my opinion the perfect choice for science fiction and action based role playing.<br/><br/>"}, "114901": {"rpg": {"16812": "Freelancer"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Freelancer: Operation K\u00f6lnfels", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1177676.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"141124": "PDF Version"}, "rpgsetting": {"16813": "Tomorrow in a year"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"17435": "Hexxagon (K\u00f6ln Dungeon Monsterj\u00e4ger)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1177676_t.jpg", "description": "user summary<br/><br/>OPERATION K&Ouml;LNFELS<br/><br/>This is the free downloadable adventure as pdf.<br/>This is a adventure/mission for the Cologne Setting.

It is similar to the Gran Turismo series. The game was lauded for having artificial intelligence superior to Gran Turismo 4. When compared to Gran Turismo 4, Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano has far fewer cars and tracks. All the cars in the game are manufactured by the Alfa Romeo motor company (unlike Gran Turismo which has vehicle makes and models from countries from Australia to Sweden). While most of the tracks are in Italy, a few are in other countries like Germany and the United States. With a maximum of nine laps in any race, with most races lasting only three to six laps, the races are too short for the game to model pit stops.<br/><br/>A distinguishing feature of the game is that it models driver development using a system almost identical to a console role-playing game. In addition, cars get damaged, both visibly and in performance, by collisions or by driving off course.<br/><br/>Like many racing games, the game has a quick race mode and a career mode (called dynasty mode). The initial choices of cars and tracks in quick race mode are very limited; additional choices are unlocked by progress in dynasty mode. Initially, dynasty mode has a limited number of events available to enter. Placing third or better in races unlocks new races, series of races, and championships. At the same time, the game models the development of the driver using a system that is almost identical to a console role-playing game.<br/>The player has just overtaken his opponent for experience points in the middle of a race.<br/><br/>This elaborate system of developing the driver's experience is used to toughen up both the player and the car that he or she uses. Experience points (referred to in the game simply as XP), are acquired for various achievements during a race, such as passing opponents, or driving a clean lap. Similar to the way that XP is lost after dying in some role-playing games, failing to finish the race cancels all XP earned in the event. When certain thresholds of XP are reached, a new driver level is achieved, and a Skill Point is awarded. These Skill Points can be used to develop driver and car. Additional Skill Points are awarded for other achievements. Some races award a skill point for beating a particular opponent for the first time. There is also a list of dynasty achievements, the completion of which awards a number Skill Points. One such achievement, for example, is going faster than a certain speed in dynasty mode.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "114926": {"statistics": {}, "name": "America's 10 Most Wanted", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"141195": "EU PS2 edition"}, "average": "5", "videogametheme": {"2317": "War - Modern"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "poll": {}, "description": "America's 10 Most Wanted, released as Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror in the US was mainly received negatively due to its dated graphics and uninspired boss battles.

Waiting. You've made your plans. Issued your orders. The forces are ready, confidence is high. The sharp report of a machine gun signals that contact has been made. What seemed so clear just moments before, now starts to become cloudy. The sounds of heavy weapons echo though the valleys around you. You move slightly to obtain a better viewpoint. Some of the fighting you can now see directly. Some you can hear. Some, though, you know only from the reports coming in from your units or the flashes of the guns in the distance. Smoke can be seen drifting up behind the trees where your tank support was stationed. Why? Are they still there? Are they firing? And what are those dust trails off in the distance?<br/><br/>As doubts begin to creep in, critical time is spent getting new orders to your units. Your well-laid plans are crumbling, as you frantically try to get ahead of the situation. Desperate, you find yourself guessing and hoping, because you're still unsure of exactly where the enemy is. Cursing yourself for not keeping a reserve close at hand, you briefly think about A Company out in those advanced positions. They've been taking heavy artillery fire, and you haven't heard anything from them in what seems like ages... and now the dust trails are getting closer on the exposed left flank. A lieutenant appears, &ldquo;Sir, B Company is pinned down and almost out of ammo, while C Company is stuck at a blown bridge. We still have no word from A Company, and the tanks are late. What are your orders?<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of the combat commander.<br/><br/>Tigers Unleashed is a unique, ultra-realistic tactical/grand-tactical level combat simulation set on the Eastern Front of World War Two between 1939-1942. It is a strategy-type game, where the player assumes the role of a combat Task Force Commander responsible for anything from a ski infantry company to a heavy panzer battlegroup. The basic units are squads and platoons, which are used as building blocks to create larger units.<br/><br/>What makes Tigers Unleashed different from other wargames is its focus. It provides a physically and historically accurate portrayal of tactical combat, with special emphasis on the experience of command. It puts you squarely in the leader's role, simulating conditions as he would actually experience them. Here, information and communications are all-important. Your soldiers are humans - and they act like it. Your orders take time to process and implement. Fog of war is pervasive - often leaving you with incomplete and/or outdated information.<br/><br/>Tigers Unleashed is not a &ldquo;beer-and-pretzels&rdquo; type of game, though it does include user-settable modes that allow it to be played in a more relaxed manner. Instead, Tigers Unleashed is:<br/><br/>Exactingly realistic, using rigorous physics and empirical material properties in firing, damage, sighting, communications, and weather modeling.<br/>    Profoundly detailed, including individual round calculations, positions to the nearest meters for each weapon system (tank, soldier, gun, etc.), exact communications transmissions (including radio, visual, smoke, and runners), dust trails, forest fires, and urban warfare among many other things.<br/>    Historical, containing in-depth information and data such as weapons system and ammunition specifications and tables of organization for all combatants on the Eastern Front from platoon to division level. It also includes a Sandbox Utility that can be used as a &ldquo;combat calculator&rdquo; for other games or miniatures.<br/><br/>And this barely begins to scrach the surface. Tigers Unleased is also:<br/><br/>Comprehensive, encompassing land, naval, and air combat systems, along with a myriad of combat support types such as combat/construction engineers, spotters, command and control units, mines, obstacles, improved positions, airborne drops, naval landings, special operations, tunnels, rail units, and much more.<br/>    Military-based. It incorporates many types of military command and control measures such as SOP's, DF/IF targeting points, and communication messages.<br/>    Supremely customizable, as players can change fog of war levels, command/control delay, unit values, force structures, weather, map scale, time scale, and a host of other factors. It also uses &ldquo;geo-morphic&rdquo; maps which allow players to quickly create playing areas of their choice in terms of terrain and size.<br/><br/>The AI in Tigers Unleashed can do almost everything a human player can, including force selection and placement, placement of obstacles and engineering works, formulating and issuing unit orders, targeting, calling for artillery and air support, and managing information. In fact, the AI Adjutant is always at the player's side to help him with these functions as well.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "114933": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Glowfish", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"141205": "iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1179125.png", "videogametheme": {"2542": "Ocean / Sea"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1179125_t.png", "description": "&quot;Free Coralline from Dr. Urchin in this magical underwater platform adventure!

Its inhabitants are nothing but dishonest people that will not be tolerated elsewhere, and even the mysterious ruler of the city is only a beggar king.<br/><br/>But those who scoff are deceiving themself, while Thalassa still is a refuge for beggars, smugglers and thieves, there are also quite normal fishermen, merchants and craftsmen, and the invisible beggar king provides the background for order. Lurking behind the appearance of normalcy, also dark secrets lurk. And rightly so for their atrocities exiled magician, nobles and followers of dark powers find asylum here. Fearsome magic and demons from the time of the Seemeisters are still active in the ruins. And behind the mystery of the beggar king the curse of a goddess and much older forces are at work. All this may not deter the treasure hunters who accept every risk to the tantalizing prospect of riches and the unique artifacts of the Seemeisters.<br/><br/>This book brings to life the city of the beggar king, an overview of the history and current situation of Thalassa and describes with the Nyktoros Peninsula the surrounding areas of the city.

It does not include any new types of cards or components, new rules, or anything else that changes the game-play.<br/><br/>Hamsterdam is a primarily card-based game, where each player gets a set of 11 numbered &quot;dam&quot; cards, a set of 20 identical regular &quot;hamster&quot; cards and 2 &quot;special&quot; hamster cards drawn from a deck of 16 (which includes 2 each of 8 special types of hamsters).<br/><br/>The Hamsterdam 5-6 Player Expansion includes 2 additional sets of dam cards, 2 additional 20-card regular-hamster decks, and an 8-card specialty hamster deck including 1 of each type.<br/><br/>The expansion does not include other components needed to play the game (flood tokens, dice), thus it cannot be used as a stand-alone game.<br/><br/><br/>Game-play of Hamsterdam when incorporating this expansion proceeds exactly as the base game does: Players create a &quot;dam&quot; made up of a line of cards numbered 2 through 12 and distribute their hamster cards (20 regular + 2 special) on top of the numbered cards. Players take turns rolling 2 d6 to see which spot in the dam is weakened. If a hamster is on top of that number, that hamster is used to plug to the hole and is placed to the side in a reserve pile to come back into play in the next round. If a hamster is not on that number, a flood token is placed there until the end of the round, at which time it can be removed by taking a hamster card permanently out of play. If a flood token is already located on a number that is rolled, another flood token is placed in a special pile of tokens belonging to that player which cannot be removed. As flood tokens pile up, your stock of hamster saviors dwindles, and flood tokens pile up all the faster. The game ends when any player accumulates 10 flood tokens (counting both those in the permanent pile and those currently on the dam). The winner is the player with the fewest flood tokens.

Hordes of violent monsters roam the outskirts of town, there's an unsettling rumor of a long-dormant volcano suddenly becoming active again, and the lord of the land has become more and more tyrannical with every passing day, most recently depriving the land's citizens of their right to mine for the precious ore known as &quot;raval&quot; - a staple of the economy for generations.<br/><br/>As Adol and Dogi begin their search for the source of Felghana&rsquo;s recent tribulations, they find each clue leads them more and more towards the disturbing conclusion that these events are all somehow linked.

It uses a 4&times;4 set of stacking spheres in 3 colors.<br/><br/>The players are members of a family who are decorating their new house. The winner is the player or players who have succeeded in decorating most of the house with the color of their choice.<br/><br/>Aim: At the end of the game, when the thirtieth ball is placed on top of the pyramid, count the balls left in the sack. The color that has the fewest balls left in the sack is the winning color and any player that chose this color at the beginning of the game wins. In case of a tie between colors, count the number of players that have chosen each color. The winning group is the one that has the fewest members. In case of another tie, both group win.<br/><br/>Setup: Place all 48 balls (16 of each color) in the bag. Each player looks in the bag and chooses one ball of any color he likes, which he keeps hidden at all times. This is the color of his preference and his aim is to use that color as much as possible in the house.  <br/>Find the veto number which will be used throughout the game by dividing the number of players by two, rounded up.<br/>The youngest player plays first.<br/><br/>Play: When a player's turn comes, he points at a legal position to play a ball and proposes a color to place. He is allowed to describe why he thinks this is a good choice. Other players are free to discuss and question the suggestion.<br/>After 1-2 minutes pass, the active player calls for a veto vote. Every player who doesn&rsquo;t want this placement must raise their hand.  If there are enough raised hands to reach the veto number then the placement is cancelled, otherwise the active player searches the bag for the appropriate color and places it in the suggested area. Either way play continues to the left.<br/><br/>Legal Plays: If there is no other ball of the same color in the desired level, then you can place the ball anywhere on the level. If there is at least one, then you must necessarily place the ball adjacent to an existing ball, whether horizontally or vertically. If the balls of the desired color are completely cut-off by balls of the other colors, you are free to enter the level again at another point.<br/>To place a ball on the upper levels, you need to place them on top of at least 2 more balls of the chosen color, whether horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Rules for the same level placement are still applicable<br/>In this game dropping is not allowed. You are only allowed to place<br/><br/>Veto: After a failed suggestion due to vetos, the next vote&rsquo;s veto number is increased by one. That way, it gets harder and harder to stop placing balls. If at least one ball is placed the veto number resets to the starting value<br/><br/>Etiquette: When searching the bag for a ball of the color of your choice, you shouldn&rsquo;t count the remaining balls, just grab the first ball you spot. Scrambling around the bag is forbidden.<br/>It is perfectly legal to hold grudges, intentionally veto the player to your right so you can place a ball with a higher veto number, bluff to mislead other players from guessing your chosen color and use imaginary reasons for why each color looks better at the house.<br/>When the game is over, what&rsquo;s done is done and any grudges should be unmade, just as the pyramid is taken apart.<br/>You can imagine different applications to each level: level 1 could be the carpets, level 2 the walls, level 3 the furniture and level 4 the lighting<br/><br/>"}, "114555": {"videogame": {"72077": "Devil May Cry"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Devil May Cry HD Collection", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"140483": "North American PlayStation 3 edition"}, "average": "7.25", "videogameseries": {"4767": "Devil May Cry"}, "videogametheme": {"2278": "Anime"}, "videogamefranchise": {"25040": "Devil May Cry"}, "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "usersrated": "4", "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"72077": "Devil May Cry"}, "description": "Devil May Cry HD Collection brings the first three original Devil May Cry&reg; titles; Devil May Cry&reg;, Devil May Cry&reg; 2, and Devil May Cry&reg; 3: Dante's Awakening Special Edition together in one high definition package for the first time.<br/><br/>Source: Capcom Press Release<br/><br/>"}, "114557": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1176832.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"980": {"name": "Mike Young"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"10363": "Jason Spears"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"516": {"name": "Interactivities Ink"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1176832_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "This fan expansion contains 21 Occupations, 23 Minor Improvements, 23 Disaster cards, 18 start cards, 10 new types of tiles, and 1 Fog Marker for Agricola.<br/><br/>This expansion introduces several new concepts.

Disasters cause all sorts of mayhem when they are played and a played Disaster is worth 1 point at the end of the game.  Unplayed Disasters are worth -1 points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>New Start Cards:  This expansion introduces 16 new start cards.

Doch bevor Sie den Karmodin in seiner ganzen Feenpracht erleben k&ouml;nnen, m&uuml;ssen Sie sich erst in den Augen der Naturgeister als w&uuml;rdig erweisen. Aber seien Sie vorsichtig, und lassen Sie sich nicht unn&ouml;tig in die Streitigkeiten hineinziehen, die die M&auml;chtigen des Verwunschenen Waldes voneinander trennen: das Rabenvolk, den Wei&szlig;en Wolf und den Seelenfresser.<br/><br/>Dieses Heft enth&auml;lt ein Rollenspiel-Abenteuer, in dem die Welt der Naturgeister lebendig wird. Abenteurer mittleren Grades k&ouml;nnen miterleben, wie alte Legenden wahr werden, und ein jahrtausendealtes Zerw&uuml;rfnis beenden - wenn sie sich f&uuml;r die richtige Partei entscheiden!<br/><br/><br/>Translation:<br/><br/>A rumor is spreading like wildfire in the north of Midgard. Caravan leaders tell them at their campfires in the wilderness, fur hunters wear it north into the land of the L&auml;ina, and waelian sailors start to dream, when the raging waves of Wyrdsee pause and indulge them a breather:<br/><br/>The Enchanted Forest Karmodin bears his name again and rightly so. Tree nymphs and light alwen, sun dancer and Viljen and other nature spirits from the Moravian myths are back after a centuries-old spell is broken. Ancient knowledge and fabulous riches await the daring adventurer who ventures into their realm and doesn't let himself to be disturbed by the howling of wolves, that many a hiker can freeze the marrow in the bones.<br/><br/>&quot;Find the truth to the rumor!&quot; - that's your job to guide you in the Moravian forests. But before you can experience the Karmodin in all its Feenpracht, you must first prove yourself worthy in the eyes of nature spirits. But be careful, and do not be unnecessarily dragged into the disputes that divide the powers of the Enchanted Forest from each other: the raven people, the White Wolf and the Soul-Eater.<br/><br/>This booklet contains a role-playing adventure in which the world of nature spirits is alive. Midlevel adventurers can experience how old legends are true, and end a millennia-old rift - if they opt for the right party!<br/><br/>"}, "114590": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Aventurischer Bote (Issue 7 - 1986)", "rpgproducer": {"16533": "Ulrich Kiesow"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1327222.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"6205": "Aventurischer Bote"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"68854": "Die Beilunker Reiter"}, "rpg": {"1189": "Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"140600": "First German Printing"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1327222_t.png", "description": "Issue #7 of the Aventurischer Bote.<br/><br/>"}, "114591": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Aventurischer Bote (Issue 8 - 1987)", "rpgproducer": {"16533": "Ulrich Kiesow"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1327223.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"6205": "Aventurischer Bote"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"68857": "Auf ein Wort"}, "rpg": {"1189": "Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"140602": "First German Printing"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1327223_t.png", "description": "Issue #8 of the Aventurischer Bote.<br/><br/>Print run: 3000 copies<br/><br/>"}, "114592": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1209386.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"26997": {"name": "Jason Tagmire"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"26997": "Jason Tagmire"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10692": {"name": "Championland"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1209386_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "description": "Sandwich City is a game where players compete to make the best and biggest (which isn't always the best) sandwiches in town, using resource tokens such as Chicken, Fish, Carrots, Pigs, Sheep and the extremely rare token...

One would be fairly easy and the other extremely hard. Pelelieu became a vortex that took way more Marines lives than it was worth. The Japanese had dug themselves into the Umurbrogal Mountain and forced the battle to be drawn out for 2 months, instead of 2 weeks.<br/><br/>[From the publishers website, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.grognardsims.com/v/PIC_Pelelieu.html' rel='nofollow'>http://www.grognardsims.com/v/PIC_Pelelieu.html</a>]<br/>This is the fourth in the PIC series of games that simulate island battles in the Pacific Ocean Area during WWII. The game is a blend of operational/tactical level combat and maneuver during the taking of the islands of Pelelieu and Angaur from the Japanese during the Second World War. The game is played in turns, each one divided into phases for amphibious landing, maneuver, and combat. The game system uses many of the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) to simulate actual combat and maneuver that both the US and Japanese players must use to fight the battle. Of the seven BOS's, this simulation concentrates on Maneuver, Fire Support, Mobility and Survivability, Air Defense, and Command and Control. The Japanese defenses are sophisticated and well manned with fanatical soldiers willing to die for their emperor. They fight so hard in fact that the Marines are stymied for much longer than planned and need to be releived by US Army troops from the 81st Division after they took Angaur.  The fight is bloody and sharp. Victory in the game is measured against the time and casualties it took the US forces to actually accomplish the same mission.<br/><br/>The game features US Marine Corps, US Army, US Navy, and Imperial Japanese forces at the Battalion, Company, and Platoon level. Units are initially setup as Battalions and Companies, and can be broken down into their respective elements. The combat system utilizes a set of combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. The Japanese player has the ability to conduct Banzai attacks at night and these cause considerable damage as the US player cannot fall back in front of these attacks and must take casualties.<br/><br/>The are a number of scenarios that simulate the battle on a smaller scale and allow for play for either island or both.  There will be numerous options that can be used to even play between players and make the fight more interesting.  These include additional Japanese forces that could have been there if they were not sunk by US submarines.<br/><br/>Game Design and Production by:    Chris Fasulo<br/><br/>Map Artwork:    Kyle Gebhardt<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"140633": "First edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Pacific Islands Campaign Pelelieu/Angaur", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "6.83333", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"17376": "Pacific Islands Campaign"}}, "114609": {"rpgitemversion": {"140634": "First Printing"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Die Haut des Bruders", "rpgproducer": {"26666": "Hank Wolf"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1181063.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgsetting": {"3818": "Midgard-Multiversum"}, "average": "9", "rpgissuearticle": {"70650": "Midgard - Die Haut des Bruders"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"16784": "Midgard (3rd Edition)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"16817": "Karmodin-Kampagne"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1181063_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Ein riesiger schwarzer Drache hat sich zum Herrscher &uuml;ber den Karmodin, den moravischen Zauberwald, aufgeschwungen.

Wer bei Verstand ist, der bleibt nach Sonnenuntergang in der Sicherheit der Weiler, Landgasth&ouml;fe und Schl&ouml;sser, wo Feuer und Schutzzauber die M&auml;chte der Finsternis im Zaum halten.<br/><br/>So war es schon immer, doch jetzt hat sich Moravod ver&auml;ndert - und nicht zum Besseren! Vor ein paar Jahren haben tapfere Abenteuer das Land aus gro&szlig;er Gefahr errettet und den Schwarzen Drachen bezwungen. Seither h&ouml;rt man aber immer &ouml;fter, dass die guten Geister den Moraven ihren Schutz verweigern. Geweihte Waffen und Wundertaten versagen im Kampf gegen finstere M&auml;chte, und in j&uuml;ngster Zeit sollen sich sogar Vampire frech im vollen Licht der Sonne gezeigt haben!

A few years ago brave adventures have saved the country from a great danger, and defeated the Black Dragon. Since then you can hear that the good spirits refuse to the Morave their protection more and more. Sanctified weapons and miracles fail in the struggle against dark forces, and in recent times even vampires have been naughtly shown themself in the full light of the sun! What will become of the people, if they even in broad daylight are no longer safe of the bad guys?<br/><br/>What princes want involves the adventurers in the plans of vampire princes, who struggle for more power. And the princes of the people pursue their own interests, too. The Grand Duke of Geltin want the cause of the disaster threatening his kingdom to be found.

As a mighty king, you have a grand opportunity to expand your empire by building new villages here. Unfortunately, many of your fellow rulers also hope to stake their claim in this new world. Whose villages will stand, and whose will fall?<br/><br/>Each card has a gold value, and your goal is to earn 100 gold pieces across multiple rounds by building villages. Do this by collecting three unit cards of the same color and laying them down. If an enemy puts down a card you'd like to have, it's time for battle! Send out your village's finest hero or hire one in secret by playing it face-down from your hand, and your opponent will do the same. Play the stronger card, and you'll be able to take a prisoner from your enemy's village and make it part of your own.<br/><br/>However, it's not enough to simply send your most powerful units to attack neighboring kingdoms. Each unit has its own winning strategies: knights excel at defense, the wizard's power falters only when facing enemies of the same color, the dragon's strength increases with each enemy he defeats, and heroes become much stronger when you're in last place. These are only a few of the 15 different unit types you'll command. With the right combination of luck and skill, you'll always come out on top.<br/><br/>War is one way to expand your empire, but it is certainly not the only way. Perhaps you'd like to avoid conflict altogether. Take on the role of a benevolent king who gives freely to other players, and you'll win bonus gold for being the first to empty their hand and end the round. However you choose to play, there are strategic choices to be made.

It differs from the original in that the goal is to be the first to get three in a row rather than four and the board wraps around the Shibumi pyramid. It is about as simple as it gets but has more depth than tic tac toe. Sparro is quick to play, has a surprise or two now and then, and is fun.<br/><br/>Sparro is played on the four faces of the three lower levels of the Shibumi pyramid. (There is no crow's nest.) To set up the board, create a 2x2 pyramid using five white marbles in the center of the 4x4 base. This pyramid will support the placing of marbles on the outer faces.<br/><br/>One player uses twelve red mistress marbles and the other uses twelve black pirate marbles.<br/><br/>Red starts and places a marble on any empty space. Players then take turns playing a marble on any empty space or 2x2 platform.<br/><br/>The first to get three in a row wins the sparring match. See the figure below for all the legal 3-in-a-rows on one face of the pyramid. If no one wins outright, Black wins. This compensates for Red having the initiative at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Extended Play Variant<br/>The standard rules for Sparro apply but with the following three changes:<br/><br/>1)  Play continues until all 24 marbles have been played. The player with the most three-in-a-rows on the board at the end of the game wins. Note, when counting, count all unique three-in-a-rows. For example, four-in-a-row counts as two three-in-a-rows. Rows can intersect.<br/><br/>2) To resolve ties the following mechanism is used.  A tie-breaker token, for example a gold doubloon or a white marble, is given to Black at the start of the game. From then on, the token belongs to whichever player last created a 3-in-row on the game board. If there is a tie between players for number of three-in-a-rows, the possessor of the token wins.<br/><br/>3) On Black first turn, if Red played to a corner space, Black must play to one of the eight edge center spaces, or, if Red played to an edge center space, Black must play to one of the four corner spaces. Thereafter, there are no further restrictions on either player. (This rule is to prevent symmetric play and an automatic win for Black.)<br/><br/>Included in the Shibumi Rule Book<br/><br/>Soft cover:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html' rel='nofollow'>http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...</a><br/><br/>Downloadable PDF:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf' rel='nofollow'>http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"140794": "First edition"}, "name": "Sparro", "playingtime": "10", "boardgamemechanic": {"2048": "Pattern Building"}, "average": "7.5", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5902": "Marble Games"}}, "114687": {"rpgitemversion": {"140848": "Hardcover version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Company: Field Operations Manual", "rpgproducer": {"13007": "Ben Monroe"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1176025.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"16820": "The Company"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"550": "Modern"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1176025_t.jpg", "description": "From the PDF:<br/>ver wondered what it is like to jump out of an aircraft 50,000 feet above a stricken oil tanker?
