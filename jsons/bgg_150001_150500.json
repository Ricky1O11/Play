Your Kampfruppe may also be assigned air support and heavy weapons support in order to achieve your goals. Your goals are to take your objectives while trying to keep as many of your men alive as possible during realistic tactical missions.<br/><br/>Tiger Leader features nine historical campaigns that can be played as individual campaigns or linked to form one huge mega-campaign that follows your troops from the Invasion of Poland to the final battles on the Eastern and Western fronts. The scheduled campaigns include:<br/><br/><br/>    The Invasion of Poland 1939<br/>    The Battle for France 1940<br/>    The Battle for North Africa 1941<br/>    The Invasion of Russia 1941<br/>    The Battle for North Africa 1942<br/>    The Fight for Italy 1943<br/>    The Fight for Russia 1943<br/>    The Days of D-Day 1944<br/>    The Final Days in Berlin 1945<br/><br/><br/>A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide which vehicles and infantry units to use and which commanders are best for the mission. Vehicle and infantry commanders are rated for skill level and even personality quirks such as how well they keep their heads while under fire. Deciding which commanders are used for each mission is a major consideration. Your units will become fatigued with every mission. If you push a commander and his men too hard, his skills will degrade. Your commanders and their crew also gain experience with every mission. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep fighting with your top commanders and crew and further fatigue them to get the job done, or let the new guys fight in order to prep them for the tough missions ahead?<br/><br/>Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. Double sided terrain tiles provide everything from cities and farmland to snow covered forests and hills to sand dunes and oases.<br/><br/>During combat, you get to resolve every fight with enemy tanks, infantry, anti-tank guns, and squads of infantry. Each enemy tank, truck, infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. A unique fog of war system adds to the tension of the combat as unless you have a clear line of site to the enemy, you may not know exactly what is coming out of the morning fog towards your tanks until it&rsquo;s too late.<br/><br/>After combat, you can rest and refit your vehicles and infantry. As new technology becomes available, you can replace older obsolete tanks with newer and deadlier models such as the Tiger, Panther and even the deadly King Tiger! If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader, Phantom Leader or Thunderbolt/Apache Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Tiger Leader.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every commander to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"223959": "English edition"}, "name": "Tiger Leader", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "6.05183", "usersrated": "115", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "150012": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1841674.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"129013": "No Retreat 3"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11119": {"name": "Carl Paradis"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"71": "Rodger B.

Dubbed &ldquo;Case Yellow&rdquo; (Fall Gelb), it relied on a surprise attack with armored forces through the Ardennes Forest that the French had deemed impenetrable. A German staff study proved otherwise, and their panzers were pushed through this broken wooded terrain with deft speed, catching the Allies by surprise with their appearance.<br/>In No Retreat 3, players command the Allied (French and British) or German forces, operating them in accordance to one of several historical plans (represented by Plan cards). Manoeuvring forces over hexes that are approximately 30 kilometers across, over turns that represent 4 days of real time each, the vaunted No Retreat series card-assisted game systems are there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable.<br/><br/>Designer Carl Paradis has made an exhaustive study to answer the question, &ldquo;Could France have staved off total defeat in 1940?&rdquo; His research yields a resounding, &ldquo;Yes!,&rdquo; and the simulation elements of No Retreat 3, combined with its novel gameplay elements, offer a rich and insightful presentation of this controversial military campaign that shaped the trajectory of World War II.<br/><br/>Bonus Game<br/>But wait, there is more! For this deluxe edition, complete with a 2-sided mounted map and oversized counters, the 1939 Polish Campaign was also added.<br/><br/>This little-simulated battle will see many new concepts implemented into the &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo; game system. Given that both sides had never seen battle before and the units were mostly untried and green, a &ldquo;Fog of War&rdquo; game system is in use, adding much replayability to this simulation. Since that this game is fast, a complete contest will consist of two plays, with each gamer taking both sides in turn, trying to best the opponent&rsquo;s performance. Some intriguing &ldquo;what if&rdquo; hypothetical historical options are also added: Could have France intervened more effectively, the USSR acted differently? What if Czechoslovakia was never taken over by the Nazis? Poland better prepared? All these and more are yours to try out. No Retreat!<br/><br/>French Front Scenario Listing<br/>Regular Game: The May/June 1940 campaign, but with an added twist. Both players will draw/choose a &ldquo;Campaign Plan Card&rdquo; that will instruct them as to their general objectives. There are over 6 different cards from each side, all taken from actual historical plans; the success of which will add critical Victory Points if the game does not end in &ldquo;Sudden death&rdquo;. What if Hitler had attacked in winter 1939 like initially planned? Or the French Air Force had been better prepared?<br/>Historical Game:  The May/June 1940 campaign, but with the Plan choices limited to the more historically plausible alternatives.<br/>Simulation Game: Both sides will be given the plans/set-up used during the actual campaign. Fall Gelb no5 for the Germans, Plan Dyle A or B for the French. The game also starting with the offensive already underway, Liege taken and Holland invaded.<br/>Operation Dynamo: In this scenario the German &ldquo;Sickle cut&rdquo; maneuverer towards the sea is almost completed! As the Allies, will you be able to save the British expeditionary Corps, evacuating it at Dunkirk, or even better, pierce the enemy lines and re-join the main French Army down south?<br/><br/>Polish Front Scenario Listing<br/>Regular Game: The September 1939 campaign, but with extra choices. Both players will secretly deploy most of their troops on smaller strategic maps. One side or the other could have some extra &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; choices for the deployment of their troops.<br/>Historical Game:  The September 1939 campaign, with the exact historical set-ups of both forces. For this contest the players will take each side in turns. So the scenario will be played two times.<br/>Alternative History game: Players will explore many &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; alternatives.

Where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, and then taking the action to the African Front, and then the French Front, game designer Carl Paradis presents the fourth chapter in this game series, No Retreat 4: Italian Front 1943-45.<br/><br/>This game will be using a mix of all the previous No Retreat! game concepts/systems, including some from the solitaire module, to depict this long and gruelling campaign with the minimum of fuss and the fastest possible play time. Each turn will represent one or two months (depending on the weather), but not every Turn will see major action! So during Frontline lulls very little combat, if any, will take place but for frontline attrition, so these turns will pass in a speedy manner. When a side decide to go on the offensive then that specific turn will see a series of moves/combat/activations (like was done for NR2); using a variant of the regular No Retreat &ldquo;Target/Counterblow&rdquo; rules and markers. The important sea invasions will be shown in great detail, the German fortified positions also, and the long set-pieces battles (like Cassino or Anzio) will be represented correctly without bogging down game play. Like in NR3 &ldquo;Secret Campaign Plans&rdquo; will make an appearance, with players vying to attain special high command objectives, thus getting bonus victory points if the game does not end in an early &ldquo;Sudden Death&rdquo; and continues to the bitter end.<br/><br/>To make the play surface more easy to use, the long Italian peninsula will be represented by a series of separate maps each showing a part of the battleground. As the frontline moves north or south, players will switch the &ldquo;play map&rdquo; map to show the actual areas of operations, thus saving a lot of table space. It will also be possible under certain circumstances for players to actually change sides in the game (keeping their accumulated Victory points): Thus both will be able to get the chance to be on the &ldquo;attacking side&rdquo; if wished for; historically the Germans were mostly on the defensive. The Event card system will also be changed a bit, with each card allowing multiple possible effects/events: all the cards will be useful, even when the main event cannot be used because of Strategic Initiative.<br/><br/>Bonus Game<br/>But wait, there is more! For this deluxe edition, the Invasion of Sicily will be added as a separate mini-game. Very fast-playing, and will be an excellent learning or tournament game; that can be also linked to the main campaign game. Could the Axis have delayed the Allies longer on the island? And what if only a token holding attack was made, with the main landings a short while later on the mainland? Or Sicily completely bypassed altogether?<br/><br/>Italian Front Scenario Listing<br/><br/>    Regular Game: The 1943/45 full campaign. Both players will choose a &ldquo;Campaign Plan&rdquo; that will instruct them as to their general objectives; there is a chance that one could also be imposed by the game system in case of failure! A players&rsquo; &ldquo;switch of sides&rdquo; could also occur because of the plans or player&rsquo;s will. The outcome of the Sicily mini-game can be linked to this scenario. Players can also change the Strength of the Armies and rate of reinforcements.<br/>    Historical Game:  The 1943/45 full campaign, but with the Plan choices limited to the more historically plausible alternatives. No switch of sides can occur. The Sicily mini-game is not used.<br/>    Short Early game: The first part of the 1943/45 campaign. Only the Southern Italian maps will be used, and the game will end in Early 1944 (historically after the Anzio invasion petered out).<br/>    Short Late game: The second part of the 1943/45 campaign. Only the Northern Italian maps will be used, and the game will Start where the previous &ldquo;Early game&rdquo; scenario stops, and continues until the end of the war in 1945.<br/>    Sicily Game: This mini-game can be played &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; or linked to the Regular Game Scenario.

It is intended to be played with 2-6 players, with one player acting as the Game Master (GM), and the rest taking the role of adventurers.<br/><br/>What separates Compact Heroes from other card games is that there is no finishing point. There is no traditional &ldquo;winner&rdquo;. CH acts the same as a tabletop role-playing game in this regard. The very first character you create in CH can be used over and over again, gaining skills, magical items, and experience so that he or she grows in power.<br/><br/>The GM&rsquo;s role is to organize and run the adventure, and will have the maps and adventure descriptions, essentially playing the part of storyteller. The GM will run the non-player characters (NPCs) and monsters. This does not mean that the game is GM versus Players. Quite the contrary. For the most enjoyable <br/>experience, the GM should be an impartial participant.<br/><br/>Tools Needed<br/><br/>In addition to the cards included in this core set, you will also need at least one six-sided dice (d6).

Celtillus tried to assert authority to organize and ally the disparate tribes against Roman incursions, but tradition and habit were against him and he was killed by his own people. But strife with Rome worsened, and his son elected to try again for tribal unification to survive against the two threats of voracious Rome and ambitious Julius Caesar. The son negotiated, inspired, made alliances, and finally took on the traditional title of &quot;supreme warlord&quot; that his father had died reaching for.<br/><br/>That title was &quot;Vercingetorix,&quot; and he bore the title so well that people today think of it as his name (which we do not know).

The Romans and Germans are NOT active players, but introduced with random and temporary control to interfere with active player intentions. Players draw chits each turn to improve their holdings, begin campaigns, or obtain more tribal allies.

He would later walk across numerous other times and entertain the crowds by crossing blindfolded, on stilts, or with his manager on his back.<br/><br/>Game board shows an amusing scene with a tight rope stretched across a river flowing down from a waterfall. Directions for the game state &lsquo;Ben&rsquo;, who stands on the cliff dressed in the sailor suit has already crossed safely.  The four walkers still attempting to get to the other side by way of the rope are named Ez, Uncle Tom, Fatty Fisk, and &lsquo;the expert Blondin&rsquo;.<br/><br/>The game board also shows people falling from the tight rope and landing in the water below.  These are named in the directions too.  Ebenezer is tumbling into the water, only Nebuchasnezzar&rsquo;s feet are shown as he sinks below the water, Ezekiel is swimming to shore, and Jeremiah is said to be going up the ladder.<br/><br/>The boat in the scene is named as well.  Commanded by Uncle Sam and carrying a small African-American boy, the boat represents the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau.  This agency was created in 1865 to help the newly freed slaves.  With the tight rope bridging the gap, and the dangers of failing, the game is seen to give subtle references to the post civil war era.<br/><br/>Tight Rope is played by the spinning the indicator (earlier edition - rolling the two dice).<br/><br/>To step on the rope (place his piece on space 1), a player must spin a 1.  To move across to number 12, a player must then spin the next number to where his piece rests.  This is done by spinning two times in a row.  If a player does not spin the number needed to move his piece one step ahead, the player then moves down the grid.  Whenever he spin the number needed (no matter how far down the grid he is), he moves to the number near the rope.  If the player does not spin the needed number and is in the last space below his numbered step, he moves back one step.<br/><br/>The first player across wins!<br/><br/>"}, "150117": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Worms Ultimate Mayhem", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"224131": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3317767.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5045": "Worms"}, "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6353": "Worms"}, "average": "6", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "usersrated": "3", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3317767_t.jpg", "description": "Worms: Ultimate Mayhem is the definitive 3D Worms game!

It specializes in jousting and duels, and is incredibly proficient at charging with a lance. Finally, the nightcharger centaur (CR 8) is the spawn of a night hag and a nightmare, and combines their most dreaded powers in new and unusual ways, as well as having its own curse of doom ability, which blocks its victims from having any lucky breaks, and exacerbates the effects of bad luck.<br/><br/>"}, "150126": {"rpgitemversion": {"351383": "Hardcover Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "OpenQuest 2nd Edition Deluxe", "rpgproducer": {"20232": "Tim Bancroft"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1827626.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "7.83333", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"1901": "OpenQuest"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1827626_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A complete and easy to play Fantasy Roleplaying game, with monsters, magic and exotic locales.<br/><br/>OpenQuest uses the classic D100 rules mechanic, which uses percentages to express the chance of success or failure.<br/><br/>This is the 2nd Edition of the game in full colour with 80 new pages of content.

Skull King, is a trick-taking game similar to Oh Hell!, Wizard and Spades, with players needing to state how many tricks they think they'll win each round. Special cards can throw off your best efforts, however, so watch how others bid and play carefully.<br/><br/>Skull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five &quot;escape&quot; cards, four suits numbered 1-13, five pirate cards, 1 &quot;Scary Mary&quot; card, 1 &quot;Skull King&quot; card, and 2 mermaid cards. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).<br/><br/>Standard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards &mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black skull-and-crossbones suit trumps the other three suits, a mermaid trumps the black cards, a pirate trumps the mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything &mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a mermaid, in which case she seduces him and wins instead. An escape card can't win a trick, and the &quot;Scary Mary&quot; card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.<br/><br/>If a player makes his bid exactly, he scores 20 points per trick; if he collects more or fewer tricks, he loses 10 points per trick he's off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, he wins points equal to ten times the current round number &mdash; but if he takes even a single trick, he loses this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, he scores bonus points.

Within days the South Korean capital of Seoul had fallen and the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army had been routed. Remnants retreated southward and finally gathered around the port city of Pusan, where American troops had begun to arrive under the authority of the United Nations. Here on the Pusan Perimeter the U.N. forces would make their final stand.<br/><br/>Korean War - Pusan Perimeter is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these fearsome battles. You do not need any other game to play all of its 48 scenarios. Design is by Jay Townsend, creator of our Saipan game.<br/><br/>The North Koreans have a wide array of Soviet-made weapons, spearheading their attack with T-34/85 tanks. The South Koreans are fairly lightly equipped, while their American allies bring the tanks and guns that won the Second World War: M26 Pershings, M24 Chaffees and a blistering helping of air power.<br/><br/>The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen.

Each player starts with two VludKin cards from different ClaNz, and their goal is to not have the lowest influence VludKin when the game ends, and therefore be the player controlling the Vlud.<br/><br/>This is an original &quot;stack-building&quot; card game for two players, with a set of rules that are quick and simple to learn, but offering numerous strategic options and dirty tricks on the path to victory.<br/><br/>Each player receives two random VludKin cards from different ClaNz, and during the game they draw a card from the central deck which they then try to win with one of their VludKin, rolling over that VludKin's Influence modified by the card. If this card is an Influence card, they can then place it under one of the VludKin, altering their Influence value based on the Clan type shown on the card. If it's a Power card, then they can carry out the special action on that card before it is discarded.<br/><br/>Failing to win a card will earn the VludKin a -1 Influence token to their total, and they can get rid of these only through trading an Influence card matching their Clan or the use of certain power cards, which might actually move all the tokens to an enemy instead. If an Influence card is failed, then the other player gets a chance to win it. If a Power card is failed, then the power is automatically played by the enemy VludKin opposite; sometimes it's in your advantage to fail a Power card...<br/><br/>During the game, the stacks of cards under each VludKin are built, changing their Influence up and down over turns until the game ends and the player with the lowest VludKin loses. With the ability to play Influence cards on the other player's VludKin and with the use of Power cards to move Influence cards around the stacks, a level of strategy is added to the simple core rules.<br/><br/>The game ends when either a VludKin reaches ten Influence or the central deck is empty, so through the use of Influence and Power cards a tense game builds in which the balance of Influence can change right up to the end on the asymmetrical board game playfield. There is little down time for the players and no hidden hands of cards, so this provides an exciting head-to-head experience.<br/><br/>VludKin ClaNz comes with eight VludKin from four ClaNz, two copies of each of the twelve different power cards, and forty Influence cards. Adding extra sets of the Power and Influence cards gives you the option to customize the central deck to how you want to play, and also gives the option for a longer game.<br/><br/>Can you gain influence over the VludKin in this original card game?<br/><br/>"}, "150187": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Hunt and Seek Young Xpert", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "usersrated": "0", "yearpublished": "2006", "boardgameimplementation": {"135737": "Hunt and Seek"}, "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2552960_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2552960.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"224279": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Hunt and Seek&trade; Young Xpert is for youngsters who love challenges.

The aim when two or more 'squirrels' are in play is to collect nuts (drop targets) which both score points and increase the timer. When only one ball remains in play, the timer starts counting down and the player must reactivate the multiball before the timer runs out. If the timer reaches zero, the flippers lock and the final ball will drain, losing a life (of course if the last ball drains while there is time on the timer, the life is also lost).

The strange serial killings have rocked the small town bringing a media circus with them. The player characters are playing agents sent to solve the high profile case and take over for the overwhelmed local police force. They search the crime scenes, interview relatives, and try and find a link between the murders. Eventually, the group discovers that everyone murdered so far once worked at an asylum that was closed about twenty years ago. They find a list of people who work at the asylum and discover that only one person who worked at the asylum is left.<br/><br/>They rush to the scene, finding evidence of a struggle, but no victim. A car races off into the night and the agents scramble to their vehicles to chase them, leading to the killer&rsquo;s house. The ex-asylum patient runs with the victim to his surgery room. The patient tries to strap down the survivor, use a bone saw to cut their skull open, and remove the brain screaming, &ldquo;You examined my mind for so long, it is high time that I got to see yours!&rdquo; If successful, he places it into a jar of formaldehyde before sealing it. If interrupted by the agents, he uses his bone saw and other surgical tools to cut them apart. After defeating the serial killer, the agents discover that the room has multiple brains in formaldehyde filled jars, one for each of the victims.<br/><br/>Surgical Complications: One of the party members may have lost an arm or leg in a recent firefight and now needs a replacement.

The faulty arm erupted with weapon fire, killing several of his men before they were forced to chop his arm off for their own safety. He wants the chop-doc dead and has sent his thugs to kill him after finding out where his surgery room is located.<br/><br/>The group finds themselves suddenly under attack from outside through the two southern windows. The chop-doc tells the rest of the group that the surgery won&rsquo;t be completed unless they can buy him some time against the thugs. The chop-doc fixes the arm of the party member while the rest have to hold them off. Thugs also attempt to assault the main door, bringing wicked, rusted machetes with them hoping to exact a special kind of vengeance on the doc.

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.<br/><br/>Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.<br/><br/>If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.<br/><br/>The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.<br/><br/>The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"311019": "Chinese first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "average": "6.75031", "name": "Welcome to the Dungeon", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "6164", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"28174": "IELLO: Mini Games"}}, "150313": {"boardgamedesigner": {"71649": {"name": "Jin"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Yumekaki", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1829056_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"26164": {"name": "Pyx.is"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1829056.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"224447": "Japanese Moonbox edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "In Yumekaki, players play cards and tell a story that intertwines together.

The working hours suck... Finding efficient minions is a pain... and keeping your well-earned treasure safe from the hands of the so called &quot;Heroes&quot; ends up being a full-time job. But... this is YOUR JOB and fame in the Inner Circle of Evil is everything to you so why not show the other Masters how a demonic job is really done! Masters of Evil is a game for 1 to 6 players where each player takes the role of an Evil Master that is repelling the attack of a variety of heroes trying to gain as much reputation as possible by imprisoning the heroes when defeated.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game 5 hero cards are dealt to each player so 3 can be chosen. Those heroes will be attacking your Den. Each turn a Monster is Summoned and you will have to place one of your minion tokens on one of your heroes that have that monster symbol. If you complete a card by filling all the monster, traps, and spells symbols you defeat that hero and can claim it as a reward by imprisoning him/her into your dungeon cell. Some heroes provide a special reward when defeated... from adding an extra monster to getting a special Overlord ability.<br/><br/>After placing minions a die is rolled to determine if a type of hero attacks. To repel an attack you can remove monsters from that hero card for a value equal, bigger or lower than the hero attack (defined by the roll of 1D6). If you repel the complete attack you are undamaged. If you repel a portion you can get the rest of the damage by reducing your life (which begins with 10). Also you can simply nullify the attack of a hero by distracting them with one of your treasures. Spells can be used to change the summoned monster type and Traps can nullify any attack (even if they are not in the card of an attacking hero).<br/><br/>When the 6th hero is collected by any player the game is over and the scoring phase begins. Players get the points in the hero cards but also get points for the most types of each monster and if they collect at least 3 cards of a Hero Type.<br/><br/><br/>No es facil ser un Se&ntilde;or del Mal. Las horas a las que hay que levantarse apestan... Encontrar sirvientes eficientes es un dolor de medula... Y conservar tu &quot;bien merecido&quot; tesoro de las garras de los heroes termina siendo un trabajo full-time. Pero es tu OFICIO y la fama adquirida en el circulo Interno de la Maldad lo es todo para ti... asi que porque no mostrar a los demas Se&ntilde;ores como se hace un buen trabajo demoniaco! En los Se&ntilde;ores del Mal los jugadores toman el rol de Se&ntilde;ores Oscuros que estan repeliendo el ataque de audaces heroes aprisionandolos cuando son derrotados para asi ganar la tan preciada fama.<br/><br/>Al comienzo del juego se entregaran 5 cartas de heroe a cada jugador de las que seran elegidas 3. Esos heroes atacaran tu Guarida. Cada turno sera Invocado un Monstruo y tendras que colocar un token de minion en uno de los heroes que tenga en su carta a dicho monstruo disponible. Si completas todos los slots de la carta derrotas al heroe y puedes reclamar la recompensa aprisionandolo en una celda. Algunos heroes proveen recompensas especiales cuando son derrotados... desde otorgar un monstruo extra a darle al Overlord una habilidad permanente.<br/><br/>Luego de colocar los minions se tira un dado para determinar el tipo de heroe que atacara. Para repeler un ataque se pueden remover monstruos de la carta de dicho heroe por un valor igual, superior o inferior que el ataque del heroe (definido por un D6). Si repeles completamente el ataque no eres da&ntilde;ado. Si solo se repele una porcion recibes el resto del da&ntilde;o reduciendo tu vida (que comienza en 10). Tambien puedes anular un ataque entregandole uno de tus tesoros. Los hechizos pueden ser usados para invocar un monstruo diferente del que se ha invocado y las Trampas anulan cualquier ataque (incluso si no estan en la carta del heroe atacante)<br/><br/>Cuando un jugador aprisiona a su sexto heroe el juego termina y comienza la ronda de puntaje. Los jugadores obtienen puntos por cada heroe capturado, pero tambien por mayoria de determinado tipo de monstruo y variedad de heroes.<br/><br/>"}, "150320": {"rpgitemversion": {"224457": "PDF"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Necromo Nightmare", "rpgproducer": {"29880": "Ray Arrastia"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1825896.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"3822": "BattleTech Universe"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpg": {"3528": "A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1825896_t.png", "description": "From the introduction<br/><br/>The year is 3072.

Corporations that have reached an impasse in negotiations can avoid expensive, lengthy legal battles or risky sabotage by simply hiring a team of trained warriors to out-maneuver the competition in a quick, bloody, ratings-exploding spectacle.<br/><br/>In Hostile Takeover, players control a mercenary team trying to outwit and outgun the competition. Each Character has strengths and weaknesses that must be wisely used to gain the upper hand. Can you lead your team of mercenaries to victory amid the chaos of battle?<br/><br/>Hostile Takeover is played on a modular board (usually 30&rdquo;x30&rdquo;) filled with 1&rdquo; Squares. Force fields and other terrain features are placed on the board to simulate a sci-fi battle arena. Players each use their team of 4 mercenaries to accomplish scenario specific objectives that earn them victory points. The first player to earn enough victory points (determined by scenario and number of players) is the winner. Each scenario is specifically designed to bring all teams together in a flurry of combat.<br/><br/>At the start of each Round players select an Action Card (Move, Melee, Fire or Aim/Overwatch) for each of their unwounded characters. Players also assign 4 Energy Tokens to their characters. Energy Tokens are used to boost the characters in a variety of ways and also enable the use of each character&rsquo;s unique Special Action. Players then roll for Initiative. Finally, players go in Initiative order activating 1 of their characters. This continues until all characters have acted or become pinned or wounded. There is a quick Clean Up step at the end of the round and then a new round begins.<br/><br/>Ranged and Melee Combat checks are handled by rolling 3d6 and trying to equal or exceed a given target number. Each Character has a chart describing their ranged and melee weapons that quickly and easily provides the target number to roll against based on a variety of factors.<br/><br/>"}, "150353": {"rpgitemversion": {"224506": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Albiele Island", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1826850.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"241": "Birthright"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"13237": "AD&D Second Edition (2e) Compatible Products"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"10212": "(Apocryphal Editions)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1826850_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction<br/><br/>Albiele Island is a haven to some of the worst scum to ever sail an ocean.

While most carnival-goers seek only diversion and entertainment, a few want something more, something that cannot be found in the everyday world of light and reason, and the Lancaster-Rigby Carnival is rumored to offer what no one else can.<br/><br/>The carnival train arrived yesterday in the New England coastal town of Warren's Rock. Opening-day receipts were fair, but the day isn't over. Tonight, for one night only, Lancaster-Rigby presents the Carnival Arcane.<br/><br/>The tents are up, the lights are strung, and the barker is ready to show you in....<br/><br/>Figments of Your Imagination (FYI) proudly presents Carnival Arcane: The LARP, the first in our licensed series of live action scenarios inspired by the horror-themed music of Midnight Syndicate. Based on their acclaimed album, Carnival Arcane, this scenario allows players to step into the roles of characters from the album and townsfolk, some with dark secrets, some with powers that defy explanation, and some with murder in mind.<br/><br/>During the day, Lancaster-Rigby is much like other carnivals, its colorful tents and avenues lined with clowns, side-shows, animal acts, games of skill and chance, and caramel popcorn. However, at midnight, long after most people have gone to bed, the carnival lights come back on and the gates swing wide, admitting anyone brave or desperate enough to contact the Other Side, or buy potions that heal incurable maladies, or procure supernatural means to fight one's enemies, real or perceived. The Carnival Arcane doesn't deal in sleight-of-hand or bottles of snake oil. Within its confines, patrons will experience true power, true miracles, and perhaps true fear. Of course, all such things come at a price, and those who willingly enter the Carnival Arcane must also be willing to pay....<br/><br/>The 96-page book contains everything you need to run this exciting event:<br/><br/>&bull;    Simple rules that keep the action moving<br/>    &bull;    Comprehensive plot summaries<br/>    &bull;    Detailed character sheets<br/>    &bull;    Informative and enlightening player handouts<br/>    &bull;    Prop, decoration, and menu suggestions<br/>    &bull;    Extensive Game Master notes<br/>    &bull;    General advice on running LARPs, such as finding locations and attracting players<br/><br/>Our narrative-style character sheets clearly explain each character's past as well as their secrets, goals, and resources. Multiple story lines give every player a chance to get involved. Note that this is a plot-driven LARP with no boffer (foam weapon) combat. The landscape format makes it easy to read both onscreen and in print.<br/><br/>Carnival Arcane: The LARP is written for 11-20 players and one or two GMs, with a suggested running time of 4-5 hours. Try our easy, fast-playing rules, or use your favorite system. The album Carnival Arcane is not included nor required, but we strongly recommend playing it in the background during the event, to help set the mood and create the proper atmosphere.<br/><br/>"}, "150367": {"rpgitemversion": {"224527": "PDF Version 16022011"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Djinnbusters", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1827641.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"23887": "Djinnbusters"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"856": "Fantasy (Arabian Nights)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1827641_t.png", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>This game lets you play a ghost/spirit/demon/baklava hunter in the fictional kingdom of Al Aalam.

A special die is rolled and the event takes effect.<br/><br/>5) ZOMBIE STEP: Depending on the levels of the Zombie Counter one or two extra zombies will be added to the Zombie Roll. Usually 1 die per rescuer is roll (between 3 and 4 die total) plus any extra die added by the Zombie Counter placing zombies in the suburbs of the map. A 6 rolled is a miss and do not adds any zombie.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to rescue the 8 survivors that stand hidden on the locations of the outer ring of the board and then return to the center tile to be retrieved by the rescue team.<br/><br/>The Heroes lose if at any time there are 3 zombies on the central location tile.<br/><br/>The Items deck works as a counter that will increase the difficulty as the game progresses with some &quot;bad luck&quot; cards that can be a devastating force against the heroes.<br/><br/>There are several ways of losing the game and only one way to win so usually players will feel very rewarded when they win as it&acute;s usually on the edge of oblivion.<br/><br/>"}, "150376": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3016500.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"218041": {"name": "Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game - BGG Crossroads Promo"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"12679": {"name": "Jonathan Gilmour"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"176601": "Dead of Winter: Tabletop Edition"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"77485": "David Richards"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"10754": {"name": "Plaid Hat Games"}}, "boardgameintegration": {"193037": "Dead of Winter: The Long Night"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3016500_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"26776": "2014 Golden Geek Best Board Game Artwork & Presentation Nominee"}, "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;Crossroads&quot; is a new series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first game in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world where most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition &mdash; but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for his own interests!<br/><br/>Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games. It's a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily- thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for themselves.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"297464": "Brazilian First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "210", "average": "7.83847", "name": "Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game", "playingtime": "210", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "24237", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"26915": "Crossroads Series"}}, "150377": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Games Orbit (Issue 32 - Apr/ Mai 2012)", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2014923.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"23586": "Games Orbit"}, "rpg": {"21600": "Finsterland"}, "rpgissueversion": {"239970": "German pdf"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2014923_t.jpg", "description": "From the publishers Homepage:<br/><br/>INHALTS&Uuml;BERSICHT Games Orbit 32<br/><br/><br/>BRETTSPIELE | Mage Knight - Das Brettspiel<br/>ROLLENSPIELE | Finsterland Rollenspiel | Finsterland - Almanach der Zauberkunst | Shadowrun &ndash; Stra&szlig;enlegenden<br/>SPECIAL | Role-Play-Convention 2012 - Dark Waters<br/>DIGITAL | Confrontation | Risen 2: Dark Waters<br/>B&Uuml;CHER | Hyddenworld - Der Fr&uuml;hling | Castle 1: Heatwave - Hitzewelle | Starcraft Ghost - Phantom | Killzone - &Uuml;bermacht | Dead Island | Die Gebannte - Die Alchemistin III | Die R&auml;der der Welt | Star Trek - Starfleet Academy Bd.1: Die Delta Anomalie<br/>COMICS | Der Dunkle Turm Bd.6 - Die Reise beginnt | Batman Collection | Venom 1 | Gears of War Bd.3: Der Hammer der Morgenr&ouml;te | Deadpool Pulp | Fables Bd.15: Hexen | Leonore Bd.1: Kopfn&uuml;sse | Powers Bd.1: Wer ermordete Retro Girl? | Spirou + Fantasio Bd.50: Die dunkle Seite des Z | Lanfeust Odyssee Bd. 1: Das blau-goldene R&auml;tsel | Der Vampir von Benares Bd. 1: Die Bestien der Nacht | Pand&auml;monium | The Walking Dead Bd. 15: Dein Wille geschehe | Chew - Bulle mit Biss Bd.4: Flambiert<br/>H&Ouml;RB&Uuml;CHER | Trix Solier: Odyssee im Orient | Professor Dr. Dr. Dr. Augustus van Dusen: Die Perlen der Kali | Die Elfen 4: Der Fluch des Schicksalswebers | Geisterj&auml;ger John Sinclair 71: Der Mann, der nicht sterben konnte | Geisterj&auml;ger John Sinclair 72: Das &Ouml;lmonster<br/>FILME | Hautnah - Die Methode Hill - Serien Special: M&ouml;rderisches Trauma | M&uuml;nchen &lsquo;72 - das Attentat | Flypaper - Wer &uuml;berf&auml;llt hier wen?<br/>SERVICE | Spielst&auml;tten | Termine | Gewinnspiele | Impressum<br/><br/>"}, "150378": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The Forlangen", "rpgproducer": {"59027": "Joshua Gullion"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1827602.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"224547": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1827602_t.jpg", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>A visage of beauty that makes her hard to resist, the young woman approaching looks pleadingly across the faces of those before her with tears falling from her eyes.

If this card is an Influence card, they can then place it under one of the VludKin, altering their Influence value based on the Clan type shown on the card. If it's a Power card, then they can carry out the special action on that card before it is discarded.<br/><br/>Failing to win a card will earn the VludKin a -1 Influence token to their total, and they can get rid of these only through trading an Influence card matching their Clan or the use of certain power cards, which might actually move all the tokens to an enemy instead. If an Influence card is failed, then the other player gets a chance to win it. If a Power card is failed, then the power is automatically played by the enemy VludKin opposite; sometimes it's in your advantage to fail a Power card...<br/><br/>During the game, the stacks of cards under each VludKin are built, changing their Influence up and down over turns until the game ends and the player with the lowest VludKin loses. With the ability to play Influence cards on the other player's VludKin and with the use of Power cards to move Influence cards around the stacks, a level of strategy is added to the simple core rules.<br/><br/>The game ends when either a VludKin reaches ten Influence or the central deck is empty, so through the use of Influence and Power cards a tense game builds in which the balance of Influence can change right up to the end on the asymmetrical board game playfield. There is little down time for the players and no hidden hands of cards, so this provides an exciting head-to-head experience.<br/><br/>VludKin ClaNz comes with eight VludKin from four ClaNz, two copies of each of the twelve different power cards, and forty Influence cards. Adding extra sets of the Power and Influence cards gives you the option to customize the central deck to how you want to play, and also gives the option for a longer game.<br/><br/>Can you gain influence over the VludKin in this original card game?<br/><br/>"}, "150395": {"rpgitemversion": {"224570": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Sinoca \"Sin\" Meeku", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1827588.png", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": {"1010": "Star Wars"}, "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"162": "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"}, "rpg": {"19360": "Star Wars: Edge of the Empire"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"22494": "Free RPG Day 2013"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1827588_t.png", "description": "Free RPG Day 2013 Character for use with Shadows of a Black Sun<br/><br/>From Introduction:<br/><br/>Sin comes from a long line of bounty hunters and learned many of their ways, even though she did not join in the family business.

It is developed by Eurocom and released in October 2012 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, November 2012 for Microsoft Windows and December 2012 for Wii U.<br/><br/>The purpose behind the game is to celebrate fifty years of James Bond in film. To achieve this the single player campaign will include one mission from each of the six actors' eras, being Goldfinger (Sean Connery), On Her Majesty's Secret Service (George Lazenby), Moonraker (Roger Moore), Licence to Kill (Timothy Dalton) and Die Another Day (Pierce Brosnan), with Skyfall (Daniel Craig) released as downloadable content for the Xbox 360, PS3 and PC and included on disc for the Wii U version. Additionally, some of the original talent from the films are adding their likenesses and voices to their associated characters. 007 Legends is the fourth and final James Bond game title to be released by Activision, as well as the last game released ever developed by Eurocom.<br/><br/>Being built on the engine used for Eurocom&rsquo;s previous title, 2011&rsquo;s GoldenEye 007: Reloaded, 007 Legends shares much of the same gameplay, though there are some notable additions and modifications. The most significant change is the greater focus on stealth-based play, with enemy AI being more suspicious and investigative. Throughout the campaign players will frequently be presented with situations that require stealth to get past, though often running-and-gunning will also be an option. To compliment such stealth scenarios, players will have access to three gadgets from the start of the campaign: the returning smartphone, which has new vision modes and binocular capabilities; a new dart pen that can fire three different types of dart, including distraction, shock and tranquillizer darts; and a wristwatch that can fire a laser and map nearby enemies and cameras.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;007 Legends&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "150446": {"boardgamedesigner": {"297": {"name": "Greg Pinder"}}, "average": "8.52174", "poll": {}, "name": "World in Flames Deluxe Edition", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamecompilation": {"7731": "Africa Aflame"}, "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "23", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"5731": "World in Flames"}, "boardgameartist": {"71": "Rodger B.

Besides these baths and centers that promise various sorts of invigoration and cures, the city place has more hostels, taverns, and inns than most other communities across the Flanaess&mdash;hence the first part of its name.

The scene shows us something important about the world, the characters, and their relationships with one another. Combat also acts as a symbol for danger, sharpening the tension in a scene by giving us a visceral sense the characters might die.<br/><br/>In a role-playing game, though, combat occurs so often it blends into the background. The scene tells us little about the characters or the world. Instead it serves as a way to work with numbers and explore various tactical options. We play a game of combat in which random chance, character building choices, and tactical savvy stand dominant over narrative concerns.<br/><br/>With SAGA we try to combine narrative flow and the game elements of RPG combat.

The ruined castle of Evermore has been besieged by the forces of darkness. A force of the undead, led by Lord Night, together with his dark hordes, has arrived outside the gates of the home of Queen Alena. The heroes must fight to withstand the siege . . .<br/><br/>Hybrid Children: The heroes have been captured by some skum (also known as quo-toa) who intend to sacrifice the males among them to an emissary of Dagon when It next emerges from the sea--and then to utilize the females for their repulsive breeding ritual. Also &lsquo;on the menu&rsquo; that same night are a group of orc sea-raiders similarly captured by the skum. Languishing in bamboo cages on the deserted isle which the skum inhabit, the heroes must decide whether to try and make common cause with the orcs in order to escape when they are brought to the sea shore that night to greet--and then feed--Dagon&rsquo;s &lsquo;Great Messenger&rsquo; . . .<br/><br/>Call You a Fool: A hero has heard tell of a cache of gold left behind in the wilderness by a witch now long-dead.

Its technology indicates near science fiction game use, but could also be an old abandoned base in a far future science fiction game. It could be used as an arctic or Antarctic base on Earth, a base on Pluto, or any other ice rock or planet in the universe. This base could be a research station or even a small colony.<br/><br/>The ice base relies almost completely on its underground power for both electricity and heat. The power suddenly fails. Backup generators spring to life and restore minimal electricity to the base as temperatures begin to drop. The crew living in the base rush to grab flashlights and grab enough layers of winter clothes to risk going outside in the extreme subzero temperatures. As soon as they are done, the power completely fails, and now they must rely on their flashlights to see. They wander around in the underground part of the base until they find the exit to the surface. They need to get the power back online by heading to the transformers and underground power generators. They also need to be on the lookout for creatures or aliens that took down the power and the backup generators. They may need to kill these creatures or aliens while attempting to restore the power. Meanwhile, they may be only to take exposure to the outside temperatures for a limited amount of time before hypothermia kills them. Can they restore the power in time, while fending off the threats and the cold?<br/><br/>Another similar idea is that the scenario above already occurred. The group could be the ones rotating in to replace the last crew and need to investigate what happened to the powerless base and the previous missing crew.

MakMurdo was an inventor of no equal, a genius grade mathematician and to top it all the greatest architect of the ages, a master of inspired design and artful construction. They called him the great builder. He designed the palaces of kings and the fortresses of tyrants. He created the Hanging Towers of Surfette; you&rsquo;ve seen that magnificent piece of work, right? NO? Who are you people? Anyhow, his last great work was a gift to the people, the most wondrous public works project ever envisioned. The most complex waste water system ever devised. Where did he build this master work? Why right here under this city. Endless miles of runoff tunnels and slurry flow tubes, catch basins and skimming pools, reservoirs and fonts, the old architect of the ages really out did himself with this one. The sheer scale of it drove him mad they say. But they&rsquo;re idiots! It was the Henkle root extract that drove him mad, took it for his rheumatism, he did. Old MakMurdo, went crazy as a Yottle in a bottle, he disappeared down there, you know, oh it was ages ago. They say he took his crew with him, his top men, down they went , dragging all sorts of treasures along, the best of his inventions, all sorts of prizes and wonders, all worth a king&rsquo;s ransom. They say he just kept on building, just kept going, tunneling, paving, and plumbing along until the end. When was that? No one knows for sure. But all that loot is still down there. A group of quick adventurous fellows might do real well going down there and retrieving all that wealth. How do you get down there? Well the city officials have the whole place sealed off from the city proper these days on account of the, you know, things down there, oh and the cultists. They just can&rsquo;t seem to get enough of the place. There is only one entrance still open and unguarded these days. Where? Well, I can&rsquo;t say for sure. I can&rsquo;t quite remember that sort of thing. Maybe for a bit of scratch an old man might remember such faded details. Ouch! Ok! Ok! No need to get rough. It&rsquo;s right there.
