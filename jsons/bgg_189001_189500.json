The cultures are built on a framework not based on what they produce or what they value, but what they forbid: their superstitions, bans, heresies and taboos. The things that are forbidden keep our deepest fears at bay, and reveal our darkest desires, and fear and desire make a society. The game is for 4 to 20 players. It does not require a GM. It takes about two hours to play one session, depending on how many players you have. The essence of the game players taking turns to add to a list of laws, customs and superstitions, things that are forbidden by their tribe. With each round, the importance of the laws and the consequences of breaking them escalates. At the end of the game, the two lists provide an insight into two separate cultures, and the scenes played out will provide a sense of how those cultures interact and conflicts that will emerge in that interaction.

The name that their lover moans in bed? The name that their mother used when scolding them?<br/><br/>Names have power. A being who knows your true name&mdash;your Nomen&mdash;has mystical power over you. They can see your essence, can summon you, and with a little know-how, they can exert some amount of control over your actions. That's the reason why beings of power are known by so many false names. It defuses the influence and control that others have over them.<br/><br/>Nomina (that&rsquo;s the plural) of mortals are useful in the mortal sphere. Nomina of creatures of power&mdash;well, those get you a little something extra. The Nomen of a truly magical being can grant its user a little bit of the being&rsquo;s power. These Nomina are therefore of particular value. There's nothing you can do to lessen the impact of your true name&mdash;you can only hide it.<br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s the service we at Anonym provide. For a reasonable fee, we guarantee that no one&mdash;be they meddlesome warlock, frisky entrepreneur, dead god, or any other identity thief&mdash;will discover your Nomen. Open an Anonym Silver account, and our Memetic Specialists will monitor your identity and see whose prying eyes are trying to find you. We will inform you of all dangerous internet searches, library use, and occult rituals.<br/><br/>And if someone does manage to somehow unearth your Nomen, we promise to neutralize all memetic threat and fix all damage within 48 hours&mdash;or YOUR MONEY BACK.<br/><br/>"}, "189052": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3585484.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"205233": {"name": "Sea of Clouds: Kali Khan"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"72628": {"name": "Th\u00e9o Rivi\u00e8re"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"12016": "Miguel Coimbra"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"9382": {"name": "Hutter Trade GmbH + Co KG"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3585484_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "\u200bIn Sea of Clouds, as captain of a flying pirate ship, recruit a cutthroat crew, collect relics and unearth the best rum by gathering shares of Loot.

You must decide to either take all the cards in the Share then add the top card from the deck face-down to this Loot space, or to leave the Share and look at the next one. If you choose to do the latter, add the top card from the deck to the Share you declined (or a Doubloon, if there's already three cards), thus increasing its value for the next player. If no shares interest you, blindly take the top card of the deck.<br/><br/>The card backs give you a hint about what&rsquo;s in the next Shares: Pirates to board other ships, legendary Relics to collect, Rum to be scored at the end of the game, and Items with permanent, immediate, or secret effects.<br/><br/>Every 4 or 5 rounds (depending on the number of players), Boarding action will occur!

Each player assumes the role of a worker in the tavern.

The Main area, where the guests are located and from where each player must pick up an Order, Cellar where all the ingredients that are used to complete the Orders are located, Kitchen where players can work to receive different rewards, as well as the Chores section. Also, the board features the Wizards workshop where the players can seek help for completing the Orders and Nasty the Dwarf's office where the players can go and try to suck up to the boss and badmouth a coworker.<br/><br/>The players will have to complete the Orders as soon as possible, because for each round they are late, they&rsquo;ll receive less points than the Order's original value.<br/><br/>Also, for being late with the Orders, your reputation with Nasty the Dwarf is affected, something that is vital in the game.<br/><br/>To stand out from other workers and gain your employers favor, you&rsquo;ll need to skillfully manage the orders from your customers and the resource ingredients. You&rsquo;ll have to carefully prioritize your moves, and choose from what kind of work you&rsquo;ll profit the most out of the situation.<br/><br/>So&hellip; do you have what it takes?

Constructs are expensive, difficult to repair, and require a certain mastery of spellcasting. The engineer scoffs at such excuses, turning all her intellect and work ethic towards creation. Spending years locked away in schools and laboratories, she explores all the secrets constructcrafting has to offer. The engineer&rsquo;s creations are her sword, armor, and art. While learning to craft her automatons might make her a peerless master in any number of areas, her first love is always the design and creation of magical life.<br/><br/>Role: An engineer fights alongside or within her constructs, relying heavily on creations during combat. An engineer&rsquo;s power comes from careful preparation in modifying her servants and crafting items of power.

Held once every five years, it is the biggest sports festival of the fantasy world. The Grand Monster Slam is a peaceful, cultural sporting event where all the creatures of GHoLD congregate in the capital to participate in the famous Grand Slam event. You are the Dwarves' champion, small, hairy but also sturdy and strong. Are you skillful enough to win? Will you represent your people honourably? Can you survive the opposing fans if you do win? It's you against sixteen opponents - all looking to pit their strength against you. Have you got what it takes? Can you survive and bring the Yellow Jerkin and the Golden Medal back to your people?<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Grand Monster Slam is a fantasy sports game with some similarity to Dodgeball. The aim of the game is to kick six small rotund creatures called Beloms from your baseline across the opponent's baseline. If a player is hit by a Belom kicked by the opponent, they are knocked out for a period of time. If all the Beloms are on the other side of the pitch, a player can attempt to run across the pitch for a 'Home Run' which wins the match.<br/><br/>After each match there is a bonus round for additional points called &quot;Revenge of the Beloms&quot; where the player is besieged by angry Beloms which must be fended off with a wooden pole.<br/><br/>Games are played in an 8 player knockout contest. So winning three games in a row completes a league. At this point there is a further challenge called &quot;Faulton Feeding&quot;. In this game six large mouthed Faultons sit on pedestals along the opposing baseline. The player must attempt to kick their six Beloms into the open mouths of the Faultons. A score of 2 or more is required to progress from league 1 to league 2. A score of 4 or more is required to progress from league 2 to league 3.<br/><br/>"}, "189088": {"rpgitemversion": {"293076": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Red Raven Demo Scenario", "rpgproducer": {"87509": "Lee Davies"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2778372.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"29477": "Red Raven"}, "rpgcategory": {"2622": "Quick Start / Fast Play Rules"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2778372_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Red Raven was a rules light role-playing game developed to be easy for beginners.  This Demo Scenario includes introductory (&quot;quick start&quot;) rules that allow character creation and advancement.  Characters have six Attributes:  Strength, Prowess, Endurance, Wits, Charisma, and Awareness.  Attributes have Ratings running from 1 to 40, though typically an adult will have about a 5 and an experienced, gifted hero will have about 25.  Characters also have Skills with Ratings from 1-5 and &quot;Advanced&quot;.  The Skill Rating determines how many D10 are used in a dice pool, the Attribute determines the modifier applied to the highest result in the pool.  This is compared against a target difficulty.  A result of &quot;10&quot; explodes into a subsequent result.  Combat works essentially the same way but the target number is the opponent's defensive roll.  Hits result in Hit Point damage.  Experience can be gained and spent to increase Attribute or Skill Ratings.<br/><br/>The Ghosts of Wrecker Cover, the scenario included in the demo book, takes place on the Isle of Korak which is riven by violence between rival factions.  The scenario includes four (optional) pre-generated characters, maps, tables, and a brief bestiary.<br/><br/>"}, "189090": {"rpgitemversion": {"293080": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Syst\u00e8me modulaire d30", "rpgproducer": {"44811": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Darmont"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2778752.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpg": {"29505": "Syst\u00e8me modulaire d30"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2778752_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>D30 is a RPG system meant to be generic by adding modules to a robust core mechanic.<br/><br/>As its name indicate, it primarily uses a D30 (30 sided dice).<br/><br/>Syst&egrave;me modulaire D30 is self published and released under Creative Commons license by-nc-sa fr 2.0.<br/><br/>This document is the base system.<br/><br/>Currently only available in French.<br/><br/>"}, "189091": {"rpgitemversion": {"293081": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Feuille de personnage", "rpgproducer": {"44811": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Darmont"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2778684.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpg": {"29505": "Syst\u00e8me modulaire d30"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2778684_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>D30 is a RPG system meant to be generic by adding modules to a robust core mechanic.<br/><br/>As its name indicate, it primarily uses a D30 (30 sided dice).<br/><br/>Syst&egrave;me modulaire D30 is self published and released under Creative Commons license by-nc-sa fr 2.0.<br/><br/>This is the character sheet.<br/><br/>Currently only available in French.<br/><br/>"}, "189092": {"rpgitemversion": {"293082": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "La magie \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire", "rpgproducer": {"44811": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Darmont"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2778701.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpg": {"29505": "Syst\u00e8me modulaire d30"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2778701_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>D30 is a RPG system meant to be generic by adding modules to a robust core mechanic.<br/><br/>As its name indicate, it primarily uses a D30 (30 sided dice).<br/><br/>Syst&egrave;me modulaire D30 is self published and released under Creative Commons license by-nc-sa fr 2.0.<br/><br/>This is the basic magic system<br/><br/>Currently only available in French.<br/><br/>"}, "189093": {"rpgitemversion": {"293083": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Pouvoirs Psis", "rpgproducer": {"44811": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Darmont"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2778734.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpg": {"29505": "Syst\u00e8me modulaire d30"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2778734_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>D30 is a RPG system meant to be generic by adding modules to a robust core mechanic.<br/><br/>As its name indicate, it primarily uses a D30 (30 sided dice).<br/><br/>Syst&egrave;me modulaire D30 is self published and released under Creative Commons license by-nc-sa fr 2.0.<br/><br/>This is the rules for psionic powers.<br/><br/>Currently only available in French.<br/><br/>"}, "189095": {"rpgitemversion": {"293085": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Alli\u00e9s, adversaires et autres cr\u00e9atures", "rpgproducer": {"44811": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Darmont"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2778660.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpg": {"29505": "Syst\u00e8me modulaire d30"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2778660_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>D30 is a RPG system meant to be generic by adding modules to a robust core mechanic.<br/><br/>As its name indicate, it primarily uses a D30 (30 sided dice).<br/><br/>Syst&egrave;me modulaire D30 is self published and released under Creative Commons license by-nc-sa fr 2.0.<br/><br/>This is the rules for NPCs -

At the end there is a scoring depending on cards played under each leader.<br/><br/>"}, "189101": {"boardgamedesigner": {"87511": {"name": "\u65e5\u9670 (Hikage)"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Doku No Oukan", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"87512": "\u3042\u307e\u304a\u3061\u7dcf\u7d71 (Amaochi Rin)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"31105": {"name": "AHC"}}, "boardgameversion": {"293099": "Japanese first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "User summary:<br/>\u6bd2\u306e\u738b\u51a0 (Doku No Oukan) means Crown Of Poison in English and features the accession to the throne by use of poison.<br/><br/>In this game, players are King's successors and struggle to be the next King.

Each round, they secretly choose other player or the current King, who is not a player, as a poisoning target.<br/><br/>The most chosen player is poisoned and loses one life, but has a chance to retaliate.

If the retaliation is unsuccessful, the named player does the same to the poisoned player.<br/><br/>If at least one player chose the King, the King loses one life, and if the King's life is reduced to zero, the game ends and the player with the most rights to the throne is crowned as the new King.<br/><br/>Each player has a hidden special ability.

So we naturally decided to create some for game fairs, as &quot;thank you's&quot; to the people who have helped us etc. We ended up creating 8 new Character cards and a silly alternate artwork first player card with our faces on - the last one only in 14 copies, they are for family and friends.<br/><br/>While including them in the game was not an option, we really wanted to give something more to the backers. While people attending game fairs and buying the game can get one or two cards, we now bring you the option of getting them all as PnP. We will release them all in October, but we will also add one to the PnP files each time the number of likes (thumbs) on the big Essen preview list rises by 5 (it is currently at 74 likes, currently making it the 13th most liked game - out of more than 1.000!)! You can find links to the latest PnP edition in this backers-only update.<br/><br/>The cards all substitute other cards in the game. If you play using sleeves, simply swap the original card with the promo card before playing. If you do not use sleeves, the best method is properly to wait for the original to be turned over and then substitute it with the promo card.<br/><br/>Please notice, that this &quot;Kickstarter mini-expansion&quot; is designed as promo-cards, they are not perfectly balanced or nearly as thoroughly tested as our regular cards are. We do not recommend to use them in the first few games, but for experienced players, especially the ladies add more complexity during the first rounds - and alters the tactics immensely.

No sane folk live between the soot of the sky and the ash of the earth, but you&rsquo;re here now to see that the East gets access to the precious fruit and produce that grow west of the Rockies. The trouble is the folk who do live here.<br/><br/>In addition to the great famine, the air poisons the land and the water, emaciating and driving mad the humans and mammals exposed to it. People become so listless they might as well be dead. But they don&rsquo;t die. No one understands it, but these diseased individuals go on, without memory, sense of self, or any civilization. They are called &lsquo;husks&rsquo; and they are a pitiful nuisance at best, terrifyingly dangerous the rest of the time, attacking normal humans on sight, clawing and biting without regard for civility or their own safety.<br/><br/>Your job is to protect the rail workers as they lay the track west, and you do, but the railroad also asks you to clear out ghost towns that are in the way, to investigate worrisome occurrences, and to handle the locals however necessary. Your title is wrangler, but some call you railroader.<br/><br/>"}, "189113": {"rpg": {"1181": "Creeks & Crawdads"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Creeks and Crawdads (Impact System)", "rpgproducer": {"6133": "Alexander Cherry"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2783210.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"293121": "HTML Version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"941": "Animal"}, "rpgcategory": {"2130": "Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2783210_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>Creeks and Crawdads was originally published by M.

That six-hour marathon game session started 15 minutes ago, and you have already killed a player character (PC)!  He was decapitated while being consumed in dragon fire, and his corpse fell into a sphere of annihilation.  Your prediction for recovery is &ldquo;not likely.&rdquo;  You built pre-generated characters for this campaign six months and four character levels ago!  You don&rsquo;t want your player to sit and read the newspaper for the next 5.75 hours.  You need a comparable-level character sheet quickly.<br/><br/>OR&hellip; A new player has just shown up to your table willing to learn to sling dice.  You found out he or she was coming thirty minutes before game time.  Your regular crew of miscreants has already killed off all the spare pre-generated characters you rolled up with gleeful abandon, while cackling wildly and uttering something about &ldquo;drive &lsquo;em like you stole &lsquo;em.&rdquo;  You want this first gaming experience to be fun and memorable, so you don&rsquo;t want to completely wing it.  You need a character sheet, right now.<br/><br/>Welcome to Instant Character!  Just add a player, and go!  In this product, you will discover twenty complete stat blocks for a single PC, level 1 through 20, adhering to the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game rules.  The core format adheres to the standard non-player character (NPC) stat block most GMs are already familiar with minus the Tactics section.  This makes it easier for the GM to assist with finding information and also prepares the player for the day he or she is running games!  The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.  Sources for spells, races, classes, archetypes, and prestige classes from sources other than the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&trade; (PZO1110) are listed in the Sources section and can be referenced in the Pathfinder&reg; Roleplaying Game Reference Document.<br/><br/>At the end of this document is a sheet of character and spell tokens including a token for this character and assorted Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and spell effects.  For best results, print the token page and laminate the entire sheet.  Initially cut out into squares.  To improve ability to move and pick up the laminated tokens, trim off the gray corners to make an octagonal shape.<br/><br/>"}, "189115": {"rpg": {"25418": "5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Into the Wild", "rpgproducer": {"77178": "B.

The Stage Three version of this game is intended for the FU: the Free, Universal RPG RPG.  The Stage One and Two versions include their own unrelated system.<br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/><br/>Introduction: During the Fall of 1812 Napoleon was gripped in a fight for control of Russia. His soldiers were working their way forward and the end was in sight. At the doors of Moscow, the Russian emperor called for his cabinet and asked for any way they could turn back the enemy. A plan was hatched to use the most powerful magics at their disposal. A burst of magic flowed from that camp and city far and wide. It is said that the explosion could be seen from the eastern parts of Scotland and heard in the heart of the Levant.<br/>Moscow became a gateway. Creatures imbued with magical properties are tearing through Capitals and villages. National boundaries meant nothing to them. Europe, the grand palaces, and the heart of modern civilization, is in jeopardy. England, perhaps because of the water of the Channel, is so far untouched.<br/><br/>What this game is about: Journey, Improvisation and Exploration. The players are specialists hired by the newly formed Crisis Congress who are going to make their way to Moscow. They have been tasked with closing this fount of magical beings and restoring Europe to its former glory. But the road to Moscow is long and far from easy. Thanks to the magical blight, Europe is more foreign and even more alien than the Far East or Deep Afrika.<br/><br/>"}, "189118": {"poll": {}, "name": "Battle Plan", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "1986", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2802753_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"191": {"name": "Flying Buffalo, Inc.

It is the only brick factory left in Europe using peat as fuel.

When industrial peat cutting was introduced in the early 20th century, the power plant in Wiesmoor was built in order to press ahead with the moor colonization. It went into operation in 1909 and was producing electricity until 1965, burning through up to 120,000 tons of peat per year. In 1925, a greenhouse plantation was built next to the power plant to make use of the waste heat. Back then, the greenhouse was mainly growing vegetables.

However the crowd quickly tires of this (indicated by an on-screen gauge). To maintain interest, the player must perform somersaults. In the two player version, jumps are controlled individually, but if one player initiates a somersault, the other player follows.

Bonus objects can be collected with artistic acts such as a scissorkick or handstand. In the two player mode, the second player stands on the shoulders of the first. Both must keep balance, but only the top player can perform artistic acts.<br/><br/>Juggling - This starts simple by controlling the throwing and catching of balls between two hands.

The two player mode has the players throwing balls to each other, but timing the taking of additional items is crucial in order to keep the rhythm.<br/><br/>Knife Throwing - The player must take and throw knives at a lady strapped to a rotating disk. Taking too long between shots will cause your assistant to casually throw knives into the audience (!) and he will occasionally attempt to pass you a stick of dynamite rather than a knife. In the two player version, both players are throwing at the disk simultaneously.<br/><br/>Jumping Clowns - Three clowns and two see-saws.

It can be played competitively, cooperatively, or in solo mode. Each player plays a Nano, Jack, or Glaive. Each character is described with an adjective (&quot;I am a learned...&quot;), noun (&quot;...nano...&quot;), and verb phrase (&quot;...who rides the lightning&quot;).<br/><br/>Characters will explore one of the nine kingdoms of The Steadfast&mdash;or they may venture into the even stranger lands of the Beyond. Each kingdom is illustrated with a set of five region cards. Over the course of a quick five-round game, the characters will simultaneously explore the starting region on round 1, then continue out to the region on the far reaches of the kingdom. In a standard game of nine rounds, they'll then head back home on the other side of the card.<br/> Each round, characters will choose how much time to spend performing actions with their five skills &mdash; scouting the wilderness, tinkering with cyphers and oddities, charming allies, combating creatures, and focusing on skill advancement &mdash; and then bid against the other heroes for the choicest cards. Each phase, a character can adventure in the town, where rewards are predictable and creatures not so dangerous. Or they can head out to the wilderness, where strange cyphers have unpredictable powers and the creatures look to bash you into oblivion.<br/><br/>Gameplay is simultaneous and every action is rewarded with victory points. Whoever has the most points at the end is the most legendary adventurer.<br/><br/>In co-op mode, characters can work together to defeat the creatures and garner the relics, but there's a catch: the wilderness is trying to kill the town. Cards flip off the wilderness deck, and the characters have to take them out before the creatures destroy the town locations and the relics and quests make it impossible for them to win. Or a character can go it alone in solo mode, which is like that except no one is there to help.<br/><br/>"}, "189155": {"boardgamedesigner": {"77702": {"name": "Koota Yamada"}}, "average": "7.125", "poll": {}, "name": "Futari Machi", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2801564_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"77703": "Dommiy"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"27995": {"name": "\u30a4\u30de\u30b8\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba (imagine GAMES)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2801564.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"293199": "Japanese first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1029": {"name": "City Building"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Futari Machi (&quot;Two people town&quot;) is a 2-player game of town development.<br/><br/>You and your partner are assigned to do development planning for two towns that are separated by a river respectively.

Players take on the role of new hires at Tapewood, Scrimshaw, and Scry-Wyrm Inc. As the most profitable and prestigious corporation in the world, competition for jobs at TS&amp;S is rabid.<br/><br/>What new hires quickly discover, however, is that TS&amp;S owes its soaring success to shareholders who are not of this Earth. Survival at TS&amp;S demands appeasing Those Below. That in turn demands sacrificing something of one's humanity in the process.<br/><br/>The competition only heats up once you become an employee. Sales drudges through the worst corporate daily grind imaginable but enjoys a brotherhood in their suffering that the overlords in Management and Legal can only envy. Management flaunts their incredible wealth and prestige without shame, and yet depend on the inhuman machinations of Marketing and the cold robotic calculus of Accounting for that wealth. Human Resources has eyes and ears everywhere, and only the inhumanly strong survive in the bowels of Distrbution's warehouses. Every facet of &quot;the Company&quot; schemes against every other unless an outside force threatens to impinge on the bottom line. Then it's all hands to battle stations as TS&amp;S unleashes the full fury of its power in white collar warfare.<br/><br/>Fortunately, one cannot actually die in a Hot Seat game. Unfortunately, there are many things in the corporate world far worse than death. Unsatisfactory performance can lead to termination, resulting in any number of terrible consequences for the hapless former employee. Left to drool in a mental hospital with a lobotomized memory, stranded in Mexican gang territory with only a severance package and no clothes, or &quot;picked up&quot; by a rival corporation and&hellip;.forcibly volunteered to elicit TS&amp;S's company secrets are all possible, and much more.<br/><br/>"}, "189162": {"rpg": {"29687": "Space Problems Argh"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Space Problems Argh", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2783231.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"293242": "Stage One Text Version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpgseries": {"29254": "#Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2783231_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.

In fact, if it worked for everybody it wouldn't be magic, it would just be normal. Here's another fundamental truth: wizardly magic is based on knowledge. You have to know things about spiritual power, the deep structure of the universe, the connections among things, and the imposition of will upon reality. Naturally, in concordance with the first fundamental truth, this knowledge wouldn't be magical if everybody knew it.  As such, wizards prize esoteric knowledge that sets them apart from the rest of society. Of course, some people merely pretend to have knowledge instead of actually possessing it. What separates a real wizard from a charlatan is that they know real stuff, they're not just making it up. As such, it's important to most wizards that they let you know what they know, so you can tell they're a real wizard who knows stuff that's worth knowing.<br/><br/>Each of you is playing a wizard who has chosen to spend the evening in pub that's well-known (among those who are in-the-know) for its exquisitely authentic local flavor. As often happens when wizards gather, however, your evening is beset by problems. But there are two sides to every coin, because for every problem is also an opportunity for you to explain how best to solve it. And, as luck would have it, there are several other wizards in the pub: exactly the sort of people who can fully appreciate your expertise.<br/><br/>"}, "189164": {"rpgitemversion": {"293248": "Stage One Text Version"}, "rpgseries": {"29254": "#Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015"}, "name": "The Clinic", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2783246.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"29689": "The Clinic"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "rpggenre": {"954": "Crime (Conspiracy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2783246_t.png", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.

Yet as always with sparrials, there's a lot more going on than meets the eye . . .<br/><br/>A GURPS fixture since they popped up in Roleplayer #10 (May 1988), these furry aliens got a bit more detail in GURPS Classic: Aliens -- and now GURPS Aliens: Sparrials is here to give them their own dedicated supplement. The inaugural volume of the GURPS Aliens series covers sparrials in all their clever, chaotic glory. It includes a full racial template, of course, and much, much more:<br/><br/>Mindset. For sparrials, theft is a source of pride rather than shame, home is where you are and not where you're from, and the smell is the thing. Treat them like short, furry humans at your peril!<br/>    Society. How do you define &quot;civilization&quot; for a race strongly characterized by wanderlust, kleptomania, and individualism? With care! Learn everything you need to know about their ideas of family, social dominance, law, economics, and the arts before you visit.<br/>    History. The lack of huge empires and widespread cooperation doesn't mean sparrials were uncultured primitives until their recent technological revolution. They have a past rich in folklore and legend, and would be happy to tell you all about it.<br/>    Tech. Though new arrivals on the interstellar scene, the sparrials have embraced technology and developed everything from personal gear to starships that reflect their outlook on life.<br/>    Characters. Take advantage of extensive notes on common traits, variant races, racial martial arts, and fitting professions to create interesting and detailed sparrial PCs and NPCs.<br/>    And more! Names. Pets. Using sparrials in fantasy. If it's about sparrials, it's here!<br/><br/>GURPS Aliens: Sparrials is a wonderful resource whether you're a GM seeking aliens to populate your GURPS Space campaign or a player who wants the challenge of taking the role of a truly alien alien.

Although the story has developed and changed over time, the central story has not. It features a green turtle and a white snake who become human and the turtle-man falls in love with the beautiful white snake-woman. The woman, however, is offered an umbrella by a human and she falls in love with him and they soon marry. The turtle man, seeking revenge for his unrequited love, becomes a great cleric so he can turn the woman back into a white snake before her husband&rsquo;s very eyes.

Two years later a naval commission headed by the Regent's brother, Prince Tsai-hsun, recommended a fleet of eight dreadnoughts and 20 cruisers plus supporting vessels, and began soliciting bids from shipyards around the world.<br/><br/>China never built that fleet, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop you from leading it into battle against the Japanese imperialists. Great War at Sea: Rise of the Dragon presents the Chinese line of battle as proposed by Prince Tsai-hsun, made up of ships built in Germany, Britain, Japan, Austria-Hungary, Italy and the United States.<br/><br/>The Chinese have nine dreadnought battleships: the eight new ships proposed by the Prince, plus the former Brazilian Rio de Janeiro. Plus the twenty proposed cruisers, and the destroyers, mine craft, gunboats and torpedo boats that made up the rest of the program.<br/><br/>Eleven new scenarios send this fleet into action against the Japanese in 1915, resisting Japan&rsquo;s odious demands for control of Chinese ports, railways and mines.

U.S. Navy Plan Gray sees action taking place in both the North Atlantic theater (on the map from U.S. Navy Plan Red) and in the Caribbean (on the map from U.S. Navy Plan Gold). The Confederates have managed to keep their communications to Britain open, but now the North threatens the economically-vulnerable southern flank of the Confederate Empire in places like Cuba, Santo Domingo and Panama.<br/><br/>The Union fleet adds powerful new warships: additional members of the New York, Nevada and Pennsylvania classes, fast battle cruisers, torpedo battleships (actually proposed in the real world!), some obsolete torpedo rams (the proposed improved version of the useless Katahdin), and the &quot;small battleship&quot; alternative armed with four 16-inch guns (also a real proposal).<br/><br/>The economically-weaker Confederacy tries to even things up with deadly but fragile torpedo cruisers and some small coast defense ships.

Yet even better tanks and guns had been designed. Some of these existed as prototypes, and some had even entered production but had not reached front-line troops in significant numbers.<br/><br/>Panzer Grenadier: 1942 - The Defense of France gives the French Army the chance to deploy these weapons against the German invaders.  The high-velocity 47mm APX anti-tank gun did appear in time for the 1940 campaign, but only in very small numbers &ndash; not enough to influence the course of the campaign. That&rsquo;s not the case here, and the French also receive the planned new versions of the Somua S35 medium tank (the S41), Char B1bis heavy tank (the B1ter) and the new AMX38 light tank, all armed with the tank version of the APX gun and with larger turrets and crews than the earlier models.<br/><br/>And there&rsquo;s more, starting with the 75mm TAZ 39 anti-tank gun, the big brother of the 47mm APX, and the 90mm anti-aircraft gun, usable in an anti-tank role as well. The French also receive some additional first-line infantry, and the fully-tracked Lorraine 39 armored personnel carrier to bring them into battle. And finally, the Germans receive a battalion&rsquo;s worth of the PzKpfw 747r &ndash; the Soviet-made T34 in German service.<br/><br/>But how to use all this heavy gear?  1942 - The Defense of France includes a set of 10 scenarios (that&rsquo;s as many as some publishers will give you in what they call a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; boxed game), taking place as a small story arc in our Long War alternative history setting.

Each turn, the current player rolls a die and advances their pawn that number of squares around the board.

A player wins the game if all the other players' motivations are reduced to zero.<br/><br/>Players' way to advance is actually a loop because there's no way out of the company.

After winning a carrot, your target number of words goes up by one for the next round.<br/><br/>Players leading during a game have to work harder for the next carrot, and so the others always have a good chance of catching up.

In the expansion book Fortress Malta we went into even more depth on those plans, and also looked at a number of alternatives including a daring 1940 plan for an Italian invasion and a German airborne attack in 1941.<br/><br/>Had any of those plans succeeded, the Axis powers had prepared for the occupation as well. The Italian XVI Corps, consisting of the 26th &ldquo;Assieta&rdquo; and 54th &ldquo;Napoli&rdquo; infantry divisions, would remain on the island as its garrison, together with some units of the Royal Italian Navy (chiefly coast-defense artillery). That would provide an occupation force roughly the same size as the wartime British garrison, as Italian infantry divisions were smaller than their British counterparts.<br/><br/>The Allies appear to have had no well-developed plans to re-take the island in the event of its fall. Britain held Malta and had no intention of surrendering it, nor did the Maltese. But we can make an informed guess as to what formations would have been available for a counter-invasion of Malta, and that&rsquo;s the basis of Island of Death: Return to Malta.<br/><br/>Return to Malta has 180 new playing pieces representing the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division, the Polish Parachute Brigade, the U.S. Marine Corps&rsquo; 2nd Provisional Brigade and two small brigades of Royal Marines.

Instead of two children, the player now controls two robots known as &quot;Heavy&quot; and &quot;Metal&quot;. This wasn't enough though and the game was eventually released only in Germany, and by ReLINE rather than Rainbow Arts. It only received a release in English-speaking countries on later compilations.<br/><br/>The Gameplay remains highly reminiscent of the Mario games, with a left to right scrolling playfield and blocks to break. Coins are replaced with diamonds (or &quot;Lithium&quot;). Differences include that the player starts with a bouncing shot similar to a fire-flower which can be upgraded through the game to fire multiple shots. The player also has a shield and a smart-bomb which clears all enemies on the screen.<br/><br/>Multiplayer gameplay is unusual. As well as the standard hot-seat mode where control switches at the end of each life, with each player carrying on where they left off, there are two other options. Dead Mode is a cooperative mode with two players controlling the same robot, but control switched when a life is lost or at the end of a level.

There are 88 new playing pieces showing the Canadian Brigade in its configuration of that era, with a complete armored regiment and a small helicopter squadron as well as its tough infantry. Plus you get a set of 10 scenarios to use them (that&rsquo;s as many as some publishers will give you in what they call a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; boxed game).<br/><br/>Iron Curtain - Maple Leaf Brigade is a supplement for Panzer Grenadier: Elsenborn Ridge.

You need to consider the abilities and synergies when planning your strategy.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>\uff1c\u30e2\u30c1\u30fc\u30d5\uff1e\u300e\u6211\u304c\u56fd\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u6700\u3082\u8f1d\u304b\u3057\u3044\u3082\u306e\u306b\uff01\u300f\u3042\u308b\u56fd\u738b\u306e\u51fa\u6765\u5fc3\u304b\u3089\u5927\u9678\u5168\u571f\u3092\u5dfb\u304d\u8fbc\u3080\u6b74\u53f2\u6539\u7ac4\u6226\u4e89\u304c\u52c3\u767a\u3057\u305f\u3002\u9a0e\u58eb\u3001\u767d\u9b54\u8853\u5e2b\u3001\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u306a\u3069\u500b\u6027\u8c4a\u304b\u306a\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u904e\u53bb\u306b\u9001\u308a\u8fbc\u307f\u3001\u5404\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u8987\u6a29\u3092\u7372\u5f97\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3002<br/><br/>\uff1c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\uff1eTCG\u4fdd\u5b58\u7528\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u7acb\u4f53\u9663\u53d6\u308a\u3002\u300e\u7db4\u3058\u3089\u308c\u305f4\u679a\u306e9\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30b7\u30fc\u30c8\u306f\u900f\u660e\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\u4e0a\u306b\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u7f6e\u304b\u308c\u306a\u3044\u9650\u308a\u3001\u4e0b\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u898b\u3048\u305f\u307e\u307e\u300f\u3068\u3044\u3046\u7279\u5fb4\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u300e\u6bce\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u9078\u3070\u308c\u308b\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u304b\u3089\u898b\u3048\u308b\u914d\u7f6e\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u52dd\u5229\u70b9\u3092\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u4e8b\u300f\u3001\u300e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7d42\u4e86\u6642\u306b\u5404\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u304b\u3089\u898b\u3048\u308b\u679a\u6570\u3067\u306e\u30a8\u30ea\u30a2\u30de\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u3092\u7372\u5f97\u3059\u308b\u4e8b\u300f\u3092\u8003\u3048\u3066\u3044\u304f\u300210\u7a2e\u985e\u3042\u308b\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3057\u3066\u6226\u7565\u3084\u30b3\u30f3\u30dc\u3092\u8003\u3048\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002<br/><br/>"}, "189409": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Nomad", "videogamemode": {"2327": "Massively Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"293651": "Windows Downloadable Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2789667.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2285": "Post-Apocalyptic"}, "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "average": "3", "videogamefranchise": {"21970": "(Unreleased Games - Available)"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "usersrated": "1", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2789667_t.jpg", "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/>UNRELEASED GAME &ndash; AVAILABLE<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/>This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Despite being blocky graphically, with a trite zombie-infested survival world, this game is not a rip-off of a Unity module, but a large world to explore, craft, and build a base.

In general, movement and captures are handled as they are in Hnefatafl. However, this game adds a few new elements.  The attackers, known as the Draug, have a special &quot;leader&quot; piece known as The Black Draug, who has special movement powers.  Also, the starting squares of the attackers, known as the barrow mounds, are impassible to the Jarl and his defenders and also impassible to the Draug minions once they leave the barrow mounds. Only the Black Draug can move to any space on the board with no restrictions.  However, the Black Draug is also vulnerable. If he is captured, all his minions are released and Jarl and his defenders win. The Jarl may also win by reaching any edge square other than those in the barrow mounds. As in Hnefatafl, the Draug win by capturing the Jarl by surrounding him on all four sides with Draug pieces or barrow mound squares.<br/><br/>"}, "189412": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2806044.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"193310": {"name": "Taking Food From Bears: Bear's Revenge Expansion"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"85250": {"name": "J.

The Bear cards have values 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. In a round, players attempt to steal from the target bear by playing his cards in sequence. The first player secretly looks at the target bear (the top bear card) and plays one of his number cards face up. If he plays a &quot;3&quot; card, it means that the player intends to steal 3 food from the target bear. Next players have two options: 1) look at the bear card just as the first player did and play a number card face up; or 2) play a number/whistle/bear card face down, take a multiplier (x2) card from the pool, and put the multiplier card on his face down number card.<br/><br/>After all the players played their cards, the Bear card is revealed. Beginning from the player who played the lowest card, add up the value of the number tokens. Suppose that the Bear is &quot;9&quot; and Josh played &quot;3&quot;, Becky &quot;5&quot;, Lupita &quot;2&quot;, and Samuel &quot;3&quot; with &quot;x2&quot; multiplier on it, Lupita (2), Josh (3), and Samuel (3) are entitled to receive 2, 3, and 6 (3x2) food respectively. However, Becky will receive a wound (worth -2 food at the end of the game), since she fought the bear and lost. 9 is bigger than 2+3+3 but it is smaller than 2+3+3+5. Becky triggered the Bear's wrath. Playing the Whistle card will startle the Bear and trigger each other player to be wounded, but the player playing the Whistle card will receive no food this round. Playing the Trap card will keep the player safe against being wounded, but the player playing the card will receive no food this round. The player that received the most amount of food the last round, going clockwise from the starting player, starts the next round.<br/><br/>Play continues in this manner for a specified number of rounds,or until all the food is depleted, or until one player receives 5 wounds.

Attack bonuses, hit dice, class skills, spells, and class features have been unified and spread evenly over levels. This means that most prestige archetypes have their prestige abilities spread over the entire 20 level spread. Unlike how prestige classes normally work, these archetypes have a few complete class abilities rather than many abilities limited to a low level. In some cases, you get the choice of one of several class abilities rather than stymied versions of all the abilities.<br/><br/>A prestige archetype generally has elements of one or more regular character classes, to represent how prestige prerequisites were met and character development after the prestige class has ended. Sometimes there is more than one class that naturally leads itself to a particular prestige class, which can lead to several different prestige archetypes for different combinations. A few are not built on a regular class, instead expanding the idea behind the prestige class to a full 20 levels.<br/><br/><br/>What is in the Product?<br/><br/>In this product, you will receive:<br/><br/>    Eighteen warrior prestige archetypes designed by Carl Cram&eacute;r based on the prestige classes found within numerous official sources. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Why Would I Want Prestige Archetypes?<br/><br/>Prestige Archetypes is something if you want if:<br/><br/>    You want to design a character around a specific prestige class but do not want to worry about jumping back and forth between class books. <br/>    As a GM, you want a streamlined way to make a prestige class-based opponent to challenge your players as quick as possible.<br/>    Many prestige archetypes are tightly focused on their theme, meaning that you more of your time adventuring and less of your time leveling up your character. <br/>    As a GM, you want to provide new players with an easier class to get into that still possesses some exciting abilities.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "189414": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2796195.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1005": {"name": "Todd Breitenstein"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"227650": "Zombies!!!

The players take on the rolls of ideologists struggling to have the movement embrace their separate interpretations of socialism.
