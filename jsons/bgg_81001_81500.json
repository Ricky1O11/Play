Most ports retained the majority of the original gameplay but with more primitive graphics.<br/><br/>The first port was to the NES in 1991. This version features several distinct changes compared to the original arcade game, including two brand new levels (Snowy Central Park and House of Shogun) that feature several new enemies and two new boss characters designed specifically for the port. The rest of the levels were also extended with several subtle alterations.<br/><br/>In 1992 TMNT II was also ported to a number of home computers including Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari, Commodore 64, PC and ZX Spectrum. These were all similar in gameplay to the original arcade game and did not feature the exclusive content seen in the NES port.<br/><br/>A version of the original arcade game can also be found as an unlockable bonus in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: BattleNexus.<br/><br/>TMNT II was known as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles II: The Arcade Game and Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles II: The Coin Op in Europe due to harsher censorship deeming the word 'Ninja' to carry too many violent connotations (the cartoon suffered similar censorship issues at the time).<br/><br/>"}, "81005": {"videogame": ["Sega Genesis Classic Collection: Gold Edition", "Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection"], "poll": [], "name": "Shining Force II", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Genesis edition", "Wii Virtual Console edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic968779.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Shining Force"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Camelot Software Planning", "SEGA Corporation"], "videogamefranchise": ["Shining"], "videogameplatform": ["SEGA Genesis", "Wii", "Windows"], "usersrated": "37", "average": "8.24324", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation", "SEGA of America, Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["Sega Genesis Classic Collection: Gold Edition", "Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic968779_t.jpg", "description": "Shining Force II, also known as Shining Force II: The Ancient Seal (\u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9II \u53e4\u3048\u306e\u5c01\u5370, Shainingu F\u014dsu Ts\u016b: Inishie no F\u016bin), is a tactical role-playing game for the Mega Drive/Genesis console developed by Sonic!

Once the planet has been consumed, the alien takes the form of the entire planet and seeks to devour other planets within the galaxy. The galactic military tries to fight the alien, but to no avail as Parasitis destroys the entire galactic military, except for one hospital ship. It is then discovered that Princess Maria has been devoured as well. The galactic military decides to send out their best fighter, &quot;Second Lieutenant Nazal&quot;, to attempt to enter Parasitis' body and rescue Princess Maria before it's too late.<br/><br/>.....<br/><br/>The gameplay largely follows the conventions of side-scrolling shooters of the time. The player shoots down various enemies, all which look like various internal organs (brains, eyes, and even cilia). The player can also pick weapons and powerups. Powerups include speed boosters, increased firepower, homing missiles, and shields similar to the &quot;Option&quot; featured in Gradius. For weapons, the player starts with the normal pea shooter, but can upgrade to a 3-way gun, a spread fire gun, a laser, and a hoop-like weapon. However, like most shooters, if the player is killed, all of the upgrades will be lost and the player will have to restart from the last checkpoint. In some cases, if the player dies, they may have to navigate through enemy fire with slow speed, which could prove more difficult than ever.<br/><br/>Another aspect of Abadox that sets the game off from other shooters is the second, fourth, and sixth stages. The play style changes from a side-scrolling perspective to a vertical one, but instead of scrolling upwards like a typical vertical shooter, the stage scrolls downward. The final stage involves an escape sequence where the player must navigate out of the alien's rectal cavity before the alien implodes. This falls in suit with another Konami game, Life Force, which Abadox bears a striking resemblance to.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Abadox&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81043": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic799325.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["David Gray", "Ed Teixeira"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": ["Two Hour Wargames (THW Game Design)"], "boardgameintegration": ["Warrior Heroes: Warbands", "Warrior Heroes: Warbands"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic799325_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Miniatures", "Wargame"], "description": "VOTED TMP's BEST FANTASY RULESET OF 2010!<br/><br/>Your troops are tired and slowly giving ground.

Sometimes, soda cans and candy wrappers are thrown onto the floor. If a ballhandler steps on those, he falls onto the floor, and his opponent can then steal the ball from him. Since there are no fouls called in Arch Rivals (the referee is very nearsighted), players can punch their opponents as many times as they want. Players could also fall over by referee and take his trousers down.<br/><br/>Whenever a basket is scored (for either two or three points), there are many random scenes that may be played. One scene has the coach yelling at his players, another features players from the other team groaning in disgust, and two scenes have cheerleaders shouting: &quot;Go team go!&quot;<br/><br/>Sometimes, the backboard can be shattered with a rim-rattling slam dunk. This effect was later carried over to the much better-known NBA Jam, which is often said to be a spin-off of Arch Rivals.<br/><br/>The TV studio depicted in the game is that of the fictional WIDB-TV. It is shown after the end of each quarter and also at halftime. In addition, after the first and third quarters, a &quot;Coaches Corner&quot; screen also appears, providing tips on how to become a better player. The cheerleading squad performs the halftime show. The final stats are shown at the end of the game, showing how many points the human-controlled player scored, and also the number of steals and rebounds, and even his shooting percentage.<br/><br/>The teams in Arch Rivals are selected at random, with Player 1 playing as the home team and Player 2 (or the computer) as the away team. The teams in the arcade version are Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Denver, Natural High whose jerseys are colored like the Boston Celtics and Brawl State which references the Golden State Warriors.

The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appear. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same.<br/><br/>At round 33, the final stage, the player will take on the game's boss, &quot;DOH&quot;, a head resembling moai. Once a player reaches round 33, he must defeat DOH with his remaining extra lives because there are no continues on the final round.<br/><br/>......<br/><br/>The controls used by various conversions differ from machine to machine, and some conversions allow for multiple control methods. The two basic control methods are digital and analog. Digital controls (many joysticks and control pads, and keyboards) are considered less desirable than analog controls (most mice, trackballs, and paddles); while digital controls limit the player to single-speed control, analog controls allow the player to move the Vaus at nearly any desired speed across the screen. The NES version of Arkanoid was originally packaged with what's considered one of the rarest of all NES controllers, the Vaus Controller: a small gray controller featuring one button, a small spinner (with limited turn radius), an adjustment port, and the Taito logo. While the game may be played with the standard digital NES control pad, optimum gameplay is achieved with the Vaus Controller. Latter-day MAME arcade cabinet developers have created customized spinner controls to further simulate the arcade experience, although the Arkanoid controller had quirks which have made it difficult to achieve 100% reproduction.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81070": {"poll": [], "name": "The Amazing Spider-Man (Game Boy)", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Game Boy edition", "UK Game Boy edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815851.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "videogamefranchise": ["Spider-Man"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Rare"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy"], "usersrated": "10", "average": "4.64", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["LJN Toys"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815851_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>So you think the life of a Marvel Super Hero is an easy one?

Needless to say, Athena herself is named after the Greek goddess Athena.<br/><br/>The NES port of Athena is considered one of the most difficult to finish in the NES library, due to its length, lack of mid-level checkpoints, and unforgiving play control. It has also received largely negative reviews from critics over the years due to poor programming, numerous glitches, and poorly designed features. Stan Stepanic of GameFreaks365 gave the NES port a dismal 4/10 in his review of the title, stating &quot;Athena is by far one of the worst games for the NES. It's amazing how many qualities of this game are well below even the likes of a game like Action 52. This is just all-around terrible. There is nothing here that will interest anyone.

It has an infamous reputation in the gaming world, mainly due to its extremely violent content in which the player can 'execute' enemies by killing them in a variety of brutal and gory ways.<br/><br/>In Manhunt 2 you control the escaped mental patient Daniel Lamb and his fellow inmate Leo Kasper as you try to uncover your forgotten past. In a similar vain to the original Manhunt, the player must use stealth to either avoid or sneak up on and kill enemies.<br/><br/>Manhunt 2 features several updated aspects, including the ability to trigger 'environmental executions' by using nearby scenery to dispatch foes and 'jump executions' where you dispatch enemies by jumping down on them from a higher elevation. It also features improved stealth mechanics, including the ability to both make and hide in shadows, the ability to jump, climb and crawl, hug walls, and enemies that have stronger AI who can be attracted by noise such as treading on broken glass and knocking over objects.<br/><br/>Manhunt 2 caused strong controversy both before and after it release. Its predecessor game Manhunt was linked to the murder of a 14 year old boy in 2004, and although the murder would eventually be ruled as drug related allegations that the game was somehow responsible continued. Manhunt 2 didn't initially make it onto the market. The BBFC &amp; IFCO refused to rate it at all whilst it received an almost unheard of 'AO' (Adults Only) rating by the ESRB, meaning none of Nintendo, Sony &amp; Microsoft would be willing to allow it on their consoles. Rockstar heavily edited the game in a hope to make it acceptable enough for a rating. They added a blurring effect over the executions and altered or changed several aspects of them. They also removed innocent characters which existed in the game environments but could still be killed, and took away the scoring system which rewarded players based on the gruesomeness of executions. This edited version of the game was re-submitted and accepted by both the IFCO &amp; ESRB with an M (Mature) Rating. The BBFC once again refused to rate it, and when Rockstar appealed the game was reviewed two more times before finally passing the BBFC (4 votes to 3) with an 18 Certificate, and the game was released on PS2, PSP &amp; Wii late in 2008.<br/><br/>Despite these problems the game has since been released twice in its un-edited form, once on PC in 2009 (with an AO rating) and once in 2011 on Gamersgate.<br/><br/>"}, "81094": {"poll": [], "name": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Dutch/ Belgian Xbox 360 pre-order edition", "English/European Xbox 360 edition", "North American Windows edition", "North American Xbox 360 edition", "UK Xbox 360 edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic958750.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell"], "videogametheme": ["Spy / Espionage"], "videogamefranchise": ["Tom Clancy"], "videogamecharacter": ["Sam Fisher"], "usersrated": "61", "videogamedeveloper": ["Ubisoft Montreal"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter", "Stealth"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows", "Xbox 360"], "videogamehonor": ["2009 Game Critics Best Action/Adventure Game of the Year Nominee", "2009 Game Critics Best of Show Nominee", "2011 CVA Best Audio of the Year Nominee", "2011 CVA Best Console Game of the Year Nominee", "2011 CVA Best Game Design of the Year Nominee", "2011 CVA Best Narration of the Year Nominee", "2011 CVA Best Visual Arts of the Year Nominee", "2011 D.I.C.E.

Unlike most flight sims, Team Apache focuses less on the realism of flight and weapons systems modelling, and more on the gameplay aspects - consisting of command, tactics and battlefield realism.<br/><br/>Team Apache is unique among simulations in that it gives the player unparalleled control over his combat unit. The player is not just flying missions- he is also managing the morale of his men, supply and maintenance, and the tactical planning that takes place before the mission. Although the player's control over these factors is rather basic, few, if any, simulations have as much depth as Team Apache. The geopolitical causes of Team Apache's wars, related in both the game's manual and the &quot;daily&quot; newspaper, are both sophisticated and plausible. Detailed military-style SITREPs create a thorough picture of the tactical situation, and ground forces can be seen in the game fighting each other all throughout the theater using fairly realistic deployments and movements. These details provided by the game, combined with the player's control over his men and his equipment, make Team Apache one of the most immersive combat simulations ever published in some player's opinions.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Team Apache&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81127": {"rpgdesigner": ["M\u00e5ns Broman", "Thomas Johansson"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Ulvriket - Det eviga kriget", "rpgartist": ["Magnus Fallgren"], "rpgproducer": ["Thomas Johansson"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1906396.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Gryningsv\u00e4rlden (Mutant)"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Mutant: Underg\u00e5ngens arvtagare"], "rpgpublisher": ["J\u00e4rnringen"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1906396_t.jpg", "description": "User summary<br/>The first campain book featuring the mighty military power Ulvriket south to Pyris.<br/><br/>Contains comprehensive info on Ulvriket, its history geography, people and culture.

However, due to hardware limitations of the era, artists were greatly restricted in the detail they could achieve using that technique; the resolution, framerate and number of frames were severely constrained. Dragon's Lair overcame those limitations by tapping into the vast storage potential of the laserdisc, but imposed other limitations on the actual gameplay.<br/><br/>The game's enormous contrast with other arcade games of the time created a sensation when it appeared, and was played so heavily that many machines often broke due to the strain of overuse.

When Daphne is kidnapped by the evil wizard Mordrock in order to be forced into marriage, Dirk's children are clearly upset by the abduction of their mother, and Dirk must once again save her.<br/><br/>As with the original, Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp consists of an animated short film that requires the player to move the joystick or press a fire button at certain times in order to continue.

Strangely, it seems that the time machine is (or has been possessed by) the brother of Mordrock, the foul wizard that has kidnapped Daphne. As the title suggests, Dirk travels through several dimensions and historical eras searching for Daphne, some are inspired by classic stories and fairytales such as Alice In Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty.

Some of the portals detailed in the following pages are ones you&rsquo;ve probably used in your own game, but likely without the game mechanics detailed behind it. Creative Mountain Games does this work for you.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s truly wonderful about this product is its scalability. The portals vary in power from the simple flare lock providing a challenge to low level characters up to the fatal death&rsquo;s door striking fear into the hearts of the most veteran RPG players.<br/><br/>"}, "81202": {"rpgartist": ["Hannah M.

They each have eight basic attributes, some abilities derived from those attributes, and a set of skills.<br/><br/>"}, "81219": {"videogame": ["Carriers at War (1991)", "Carriers at War Construction Kit", "Carriers at War II"], "poll": [], "name": "The Complete Carriers at War", "videogamemode": ["AI Only", "Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian DOS Boxed edition", "NA DOS edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic828142.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Carriers at War"], "videogametheme": ["Flight", "Historical", "Military", "Ocean / Sea", "War - World War II"], "usersrated": "5", "videogamedeveloper": ["Strategic Studies Group"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS"], "average": "8.68", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Strategic Studies Group"], "videogamecompilation": ["Carriers at War (1991)", "Carriers at War Construction Kit", "Carriers at War II"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic828142_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>The Complete Carriers at War is a compilation of three previous titles that covered the air/naval war in the South Pacific during World War II: Carriers at War, Carriers at War Construction Kit and Carriers at War II.<br/><br/>Introduction from the game manual:<br/><br/>The Complete Carriers at War is the final instalment in our series of games covering the great air-naval battles of the Second World War.

Additionally, a set of rules for generating characters with parapsychological talents has been included, but these rules could be converted to cover magic, genetic modification, cybernetics or a host of other possibilities.<br/><br/>The rules were developed around two design philosophies: First, the creation of players&rsquo; characters should be based around personalities, should stretch the players' ability to take on new and different roles, and emphasise more than a simple set of statistics; Second, the game mechanics need to be simple, yet flexible enough to allow the referee to show their own role-playing (rather than rules-mastering) skills.<br/><br/>"}, "81221": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF"], "statistics": [], "name": "Toaster", "rpgdesigner": ["Patrick Riley"], "rpgproducer": ["Patrick Riley"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1223569.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Toaster"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1223569_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>If you are looking for an innovative, groundbreaking, revolutionary roleplaying game that will lead a paradigm shift in the hobby, this is not it. For experienced roleplayers, there is nothing new, not a single original idea, presented in Toaster that cannot be found elsewhere. Rather, Toaster is just an exercise in creating a straightforward roleplaying system that has enough flexibility to be used in a wide range of campaigns.<br/><br/>Why Toaster?<br/><br/>That humble household appliance, the toaster, is a good model for simplicity of concept and design. Toasters have one basic function, a simple user-interface, and so long as you don't try to shove anything too large in it, they are generally very reliable.<br/><br/>Toaster is also a humble roleplaying game built around a few basic concepts and mechanics, using simple math and die rolling, and it can handle most genres and settings with no difficulty.<br/><br/>With a toaster, you can cook bread, breakfast pastries, frozen waffles, English muffins, or perhaps even bagels. Toasters work great for all these applications, but do not try to bake a cake with one. Likewise, this game is not specific to any genre, so you can use it in a wide variety of campaigns, but it will not work for every setting or every style of roleplaying.<br/><br/>The rules in Toaster are designed to give Players a sketch of the system and how it might be applied in a variety of circumstances. However, many of the details have been made vague or left out completely.<br/><br/>"}, "81222": {"rpgdesigner": ["Andrew Anderson", "Peter M. Ball", "Quim Ball-llosera", "Daniel R.

The games are ideal for children 7 to 13 to play with parents, siblings, or friends. Children a little younger can play them with an adult or older child. The directions include ways to adjust the games to fit the age and experience of the players.<br/><br/>Games included are: (1) Guess my state; (2) Take a trip; (3) Guess my rule; (4) Capture states; and (5) Closest match.<br/><br/>(1) Guess my state - In this game, similar to &quot;Twenty Questions,&quot; players ask questions to try to identify a secret state that one player has chosen. At the start of the game, the state cards are laid out face up. Players take turns tryin to identify the secret state by asking yes-or-no questions (e.g., Did it become a state in the 1800s? Does your state border Canada?). After each question is answered, the states that have been ruled out are removed from the layout. The player who narrows the layout down to the secret state is the winner. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards.<br/><br/>(2) Take a trip - In this game, players navigate around the U.S. by finding states that border one another. At the start of the game, one state card is turned up. On the first turn, a player puts down a state card that borders it from their hand of 3 cards. The next player puts down a card that borders that state, and so on. For example, if Texas is turned up at the start of the game, on the first turn a player could put down Oklahoma, since it borders Texas. On the second turn, a player could put down Kansas, since it borders Oklahoma. The game is over when one player plays all of their cards or no more cards can be placed. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards. May also be played cooperatively with all players' cards face up.<br/><br/>(3) Guess my rule - In this game,players try to discover a secret rule that one player is using to sort the states into two groups. For instance, a secret rule could be &quot;borders on an ocean.&quot; States that border an ocean would go in one group; states that do not border an ocean would go in the other group. the Rule Maker selects about six states form the layout ans sorts them into two groups according to the rule. Players take turns trying to figure out the rule by choosing a state that has not yet been sorted and saying which group they think it belongs in. After three turns in a row in which players sort states correctly, they may begin to guess the rule. The first player to guess the rule wins. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards.<br/><br/>(4) Capture states - In this game, similar to &quot;War,&quot;players compare the states according to a certain feature. At the start of the game, players choose a state feature, such as year of statehood. On each round, all players put out a state card at the same time from their stack of face down cards. The player with the state that has the biggest number for the chosen feature (e.g., became a state most recently) captures all the cards played in the round. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>(5) Closest match - In this game, players use math to find states that are most alike. At the start of the game, players choose a state feature, such as number of libraries. In each round, they compare the states in their hand to a Goal state. For instance, if the Goal is Colorado, which has 253 libraries, they find the card in their hand of five cards that has closest to 253 libraries. They compare their chosen states, and the player with the closest of all takes the cards played in the round. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/> - large map of U.S. for reference<br/> - 26 Blue fact cards, one for each of <br/>   the states in the Eastern U.S. <br/>   (sorry, no Washington, D.C.)<br/> - 24 Red fact cards, one for each of <br/>   the states in the Western U.S.<br/> - 10 Wild cards<br/> - 10 sample rules/question cards<br/><br/>"}, "81226": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["HTML"], "statistics": [], "name": "Cold Mountain", "rpgdesigner": ["Ian Young"], "rpgproducer": ["Ian Young"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpg": ["Cold Mountain"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "rpggenre": ["History (Prehistoric)"], "description": "Publisher's description:<br/><br/>We answer to the beat of the drum, and the people of our tribe gather in a circle around the fire.

There are no non-player characters in the game: all survivors and zombies are controlled by players.<br/><br/>Urban Dead went live in July 2005.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Urban Dead&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81272": {"rpgartist": ["Nicolas Bau", "Bj\u00f6rn Berghausen", "Caryad", "Ina Kramer", "Don-Oliver Matthies", "Michael Meyh\u00f6fer", "Olaf Papke"], "rpg": ["Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (3rd Edition)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Aventurischer Almanach", "rpgdesigner": ["Thomas Finn", "Jens Matheuszik", "Michael Meyh\u00f6fer", "Gregor Rot", "Hadmar Freiherr von Wieser"], "rpgproducer": ["Florian Don-Schauen", "Michael Meyh\u00f6fer", "J\u00f6rg Raddatz", "Thomas R\u00f6mer", "Frank Werschke"], "usersrated": "6", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic795170.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "rpgsetting": ["Aventurien"], "average": "6", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fanpro"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic795170_t.jpg", "description": "The Aventurischer Almanach is an addendum to Aventurien: Das Lexikon des Schwarzen Auges.

The game pieces are set-up in a traditional football formation, on a twenty-four square by ten square checkered football field board. The object of the game, like football, is to outscore the opponent. One player manages the offensive game pieces, trying to maneuver the quarterback towards the opponent&rsquo;s end zone for a score (touchdown or field goal). The other player manages the defensive game pieces, trying to capture the quarterback or prevent its advancement toward the goal line.<br/><br/>Pieces are moved one at a time, similar to chess, beginning with the offensive team, then alternating to the defensive team. Each game piece is assigned a specific directional pattern of movement. Once a piece is captured it is removed from the game board. If the quarterback is captured, players switch roles, with the defensive team becoming the offensive team at the point of capture and vice versa. All pieces are returned to the board and play resumes.<br/><br/>Scoring: A touchdown is seven points; a field goal is three points; a safety is two points.<br/><br/>Game Timing: The game is played in two halves or four fifteen minute quarters.  Each coach is allowed three timeouts per half.<br/><br/>Play timing: The offensive coach has thirty seconds to move a piece.  The defensive coach has fifteen seconds to make a responding move, which makes for a fast-paced and pressure packed game of strategic fun.<br/><br/>This description is attributed to Cort Hubbard, the game designer.<br/><br/>"}, "81306": {"rpgdesigner": ["Marco Behrmann", "Ola Nilsson", "Carl Johan Str\u00f6m", "Krister Sundelin"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "Eon Deluxe", "rpgartist": ["Freddy Andersson", "Fel\u00edcia Fortes", "Michael Gullbrandson", "Niklas Johansson", "Ola Nilsson", "Lars Nordbeck", "Magnus Olsson", "Keith Parkinson", "Monica S", "Per Simonsson", "Christian Svalander", "Ann-Christin Svensson"], "rpgproducer": ["Marco Behrmann", "Carl Johan Str\u00f6m"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic795604.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Mundana"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Eon (1st Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Neogames"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "Occult (Magic)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic795604_t.jpg", "description": "Eon Deluxe is the hardcover edition of the first edition of the Eon rules with the campaign setting book &quot;Mundana&quot; as well as 16 pages of extra material, much of which later found their way into the second edition of the rules.<br/><br/>Thus it has three page numberings, one for the rulebook, one for the &quot;Mundana&quot;-book and one, in roman numerals, for the additional material.<br/><br/>ISBN for the book is confusing.

It is the sequel to Frontier: Elite II released in 1993, which itself is a sequel to the Elite series of games which debuted on the Acorn BBC Micro computer in 1984. The planned Amiga version of First Encounters  was never completed; it had been originally slated for a summer 1995 release for the Amiga 1200, Amiga 4000, and CD32 systems. The game was created by David Braben's company, Frontier Developments, and distributed by GameTek. The game is often referred to by the shortened title of 'FFE'.<br/><br/>First Encounters plays much like its immediate predecessor Frontier: the game is a combination of trading, fighting and a variety of other activities like spying, bombing and a variety of other military activities; the combat ratings were also carried over from the previous games. Like Frontier, First Encounters features realistic Newtonian physics and the ability to land on planets. It has graphics that are an improvement over Frontier (the main differences being Gouraud shading and more extensive use of texture mapping) and, as well as employing the same open-ended gameplay of its predecessors, it also features a storyline concerning an alien race called the Thargoids.<br/><br/>In addition to these now-established tenets of the Elite series, FFE added a new element&mdash;journals that report on happenings within the known universe. These were introduced to increase the player&rsquo;s sense of immersion within the game-world, and to that end the player can even be mentioned within the journals under certain circumstances.<br/><br/>More important than the addition of journals is the introduction of hand-coded missions that added a storyline to further increase the player&rsquo;s sense of immersion within the Elite universe. Unlike the various military missions which are randomly generated, these were specifically programmed by Frontier Developments and take the player through a linear (but nonetheless interesting) series of events that starts with the &ldquo;Wiccan Ware Race&rdquo; and culminates in &ldquo;Thargoid Missions&rdquo; trilogy. Some of these missions can only be completed under specific circumstances, or with specific combat ratings. These missions take place between 3250 (the start-date of the game) and approximately 3255.<br/><br/>Also unique to First Encounters is the ability to earn special ships that are not available to buy. These ships are given as rewards for completing missions; the ships are the Turner-class Argent&rsquo;s Quest, the Stowmaster-class fighter (which comes with the Argent&rsquo;s Quest, equipped as the escape pod) and the Thargoid Warship, given to you by the Thargoids at the completion of the &ldquo;Thargoid Missions&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Frontier: First Encounters,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81325": {"videogame": ["Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle", "Altered Beast (1988)", "Bonanza Bros.", "Columns", "Comix Zone", "Decap Attack", "Ecco Jr.", "Ecco the Dolphin", "Ecco: The Tides of Time", "Flicky", "Gain Ground", "Golden Axe", "Golden Axe II", "Golden Axe III", "Kid Chameleon", "Phantasy Star II", "Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom", "Phantasy Star IV", "Ristar", "Shadow Dancer: The Secret of the Shinobi", "Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master", "Sonic the Hedgehog (1991)", "Sonic the Hedgehog 2", "Super Thunder Blade", "Sword of Vermilion", "Vectorman", "Vectorman 2", "Virtua Fighter 2 (Genesis)"], "poll": [], "name": "Sega Genesis Collection", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["European PlayStation 2 edition", "European PSP edition", "Japanese PlayStation 2 edition", "Japanese PSP edition", "North American PlayStation 2 edition", "North American PSP edition", "PSP PSN edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic846312.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Martial Arts", "Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "16", "videogamedeveloper": ["Digital Eclipse Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Arcade", "Beat 'em Up", "Fighting", "Platform", "Puzzle", "RPG", "Scrolling"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "PSP"], "average": "7.90312", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "videogamecompilation": ["Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle", "Altered Beast (1988)", "Bonanza Bros.", "Columns", "Comix Zone", "Decap Attack", "Ecco Jr.", "Ecco the Dolphin", "Ecco: The Tides of Time", "Flicky", "Gain Ground", "Golden Axe", "Golden Axe II", "Golden Axe III", "Kid Chameleon", "Phantasy Star II", "Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom", "Phantasy Star IV", "Ristar", "Shadow Dancer: The Secret of the Shinobi", "Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master", "Sonic the Hedgehog (1991)", "Sonic the Hedgehog 2", "Super Thunder Blade", "Sword of Vermilion", "Vectorman", "Vectorman 2", "Virtua Fighter 2 (Genesis)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic846312_t.jpg", "description": "The Sega Mega Drive Collection (known in the U.S. as the Sega Genesis Collection) is a video game compilation for the PlayStation 2 and PSP, compiled and emulated by Digital Eclipse.

The PSP's unlockables are: Astro Blaster, Congo Bongo, Eliminator, Space Fury, and Super Zaxxon.<br/><br/>The European version does not include Shadow Dancer. However, it does fix previous speed problems concerning Sonic the Hedgehog which plagued the game's original PAL Mega Drive incarnation and most home console emulations of the game.<br/><br/>This is the first time Golden Axe III has been released in Europe and Australia and the second in North America, as it was briefly available in the U.S. on Sega's Sega Channel.<br/>This collection marks the first appearance of the two Vectorman games on the PS2 in North America, since Sonic Gems Collection has remained unreleased Stateside on the console, with the exception of the GameCube version.<br/><br/>According to ToeJam &amp; Earl Productions, they were going to include ToeJam and Earl and its sequel, ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron as well, but Sega wasn't very fond of the series, so they included Sonic the Hedgehog and its first sequel, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 as well as Flicky, Ristar, and Comix Zone instead, to make up for the emulation issues of the PlayStation 2 version of Sonic Mega Collection Plus. The reason is listed on the bottom of this section.<br/><br/>It is of note that the Streets of Rage trilogy is also absent from this collection in the wake of its removal from Western versions of Sonic Gems Collection.<br/><br/>Although mentioned in passing, the collection does not include the first Genesis Shinobi game, The Revenge of Shinobi, possibly due to copyright issues surrounding the inclusion of Spider-Man as a boss character at the end of Stage 6.<br/><br/>The absence of the Streets of Rage-series as well as The Revenge of Shinobi might also have to do with all those games featuring soundtracks by Yuzo Koshiro. It is especially notable because unlike Streets of Rage where he contributed the soundtracks for all three games, The Revenge of Shinobi was the only game in the Genesis-incarnations of the Shinobi-series he composed the music for, and it is the only game of that series missing from the collection. This makes licensing-issues concerning his work seem like a possible reason for leaving these games (which are among the most popular on the Sega Genesis) out.<br/><br/>Similarly, this collection is the first release of some Mega Drive titles, especially Phantasy Star IV, on a non-Sega console, as it has only been seen twice before &ndash; on its native Mega Drive, and in the Phantasy Star Collection on the Sega Saturn (available only in Japan).<br/><br/>While for the most part emulation of the games themselves have no defects, some people have noticed that sound emulation in some games is not exactly the same as their Genesis incarnations. This compilation was developed by Digital Eclipse, whose more recent compilations have become known for emulation problems. Regularly noted examples are the &quot;Spindash&quot; sound in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 fading out in a peculiar way, sound effects in Sonic the Hedgehog and &quot;Columns&quot; sounding slightly off, the special stage victory theme in the Sonic games missing, as well as no change in tempo when obtaining Power Sneakers in either game, wrong/missing death screams in Golden Axe and the sequel, a bizarre sounding Star Handle noise in Ristar and the &quot;Victory Theme&quot; in Phantasy Star IV not stopping the battle music. It should also be noted that Golden Axe 3 suffers badly from poor sound emulation compared to all the other games, and a few games had minor graphical modifications, such as in Sonic the Hedgehog when the screen sometimes flashes when Sonic is underwater and in Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium when the screen sometimes flashes when a character was poisoned. Some of the sound effects in Altered Beast Arcade are off too, including the effect when grabbing a spirit ball power-up, hitting most enemies, and some of the beast secondary attacks (such as the Weredragon laser barrier).<br/><br/>Most of these errors have been fixed in a new enhanced version Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which allowing high definition playing through scaling-up and filters.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Mega_Drive_Collection,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Mega_Drive_Collection,&quo...</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81326": {"rpgartist": ["Alex Aparin", "Eric Belisle", "Yasuyo Dunnett", "Empty Room Studios", "Tyler Jacobson", "McLean Kendree", "Howard Lyon", "William O'Connor", "Dave Rapoza", "Amanda Sartor", "Mike Sass", "Jon Schindehette", "Keven Smith", "Sarah Stone", "Tyler Walpole", "Eric Williams (I)"], "statistics": [], "name": "Dragon (Issue 381 - Nov 2009)", "rpgdesigner": ["Logan Bonner", "Michele Carter", "Jeremy Crawford", "Arnie Frank", "Rob Heinsoo", "Miranda Horner", "Ari Marmell", "Shelly Mazzanoble", "Mike Mearls", "Jeff Morgenroth", "Stephen Radney-MacFarland", "Mike Resnick", "Peter Schaefer", "Stephen Schubert", "Robert J.

One night, he is approached by the exotic Laina Pozok (Beata Pozniak), who senses that Eric is more powerful than he imagines. She trains Eric to &quot;hitch hike&quot; into people's minds. He sees what his subject sees, and hears what his subject hears; meanwhile, his body continues to interact with the world around him in an &quot;automatic pilot-like&quot; state. Laina hires Eric to attend a wake being held in honor of her father, who has died under mysterious circumstances.<br/><br/>The game begins when Eric enters the Pozok household, and is given the choice to remain in his body, or hitch hike aboard any one of a number of characters he encounters. Eric also has the ability to pick up objects and take a psychic reading of them, providing more clues to help solve the Pozok murder case. Before long, Eric is embroiled in a conspiracy involving a powerful religious cult, spies, and family intrigue, and he also has to deal with his growing romantic attachment to Laina. Occasionally throughout the game, Eric obtains access to &quot;psychic collectors&quot; which amplify his abilities and allow him to affect the moods and attitudes of the people around him, but at a cost.<br/><br/>Psychic Detective is generally presented in first person, with icons appearing at intervals on the screen signifying people and objects Eric can interact with. Each game generally takes about 45 minutes to play, however multiple plays are required in order to uncover all aspects of the storyline, and there are a dozen alternate endings possible; depending upon the choices made by the player, many different storylines are uncovered, including one that occurs if the player makes no choices and simply watches events unfold. Occasional cut scenes break the storyline into chapters, but which cut scene is viewed depends upon Eric's actions. The endgame portion of Psychic Detective involves Eric playing a surreal board game against the villain; the power of Eric's pieces against his opponent is based solely upon his actions and investigations throughout the game.<br/><br/>The game was released on the PlayStation, DOS, and 3DO. The game includes adult language and sexual content in the 3DO and Windows versions, however the PlayStation version did not include some of the adult material.<br/><br/>Considered a ground-breaking game for its time, Psychic Detective was expected to usher in a new era of video games using live action footage and professional actors, however except for a few similar games such as 3DO's Snow Job, this new trend never took off. Live action footage from Psychic Detective was edited together to create a short film that was shown at film festivals in the mid-1990s.<br/><br/>This game is not to be confused with the Japanese-only Psychic Detective series of adventure games developed by DataWest.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Psychic Detective,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81397": {"poll": [], "name": "Anacreon: Reconstruction 4021", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["DOS Downloadable edition", "US DOS edition", "Windows Downloadable Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1094143.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "Space", "War - Future"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)", "Thinking Machine Associates"], "videogamegenre": ["4x Strategy", "Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["DOS", "Windows"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Web published)", "Thinking Machine Associates"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1094143_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Anacreon: Reconstruction 4021 is a DOS computer game originally written by George Moromisato, and published by TMA in 1987.

One day, vicious fighting broke out everywhere as the army from Cartahena, led by the wizard-king Tsarkon, swarmed all over the town. The townsmen were overwhelmed, and the castle of King Erik V collapsed. Erik V summoned his bravest, strongest and most faithful warrior, Blade, and gave him his infant son and an ancient family heirloom, the Ring of Wisdom. Erik ordered Blade to save himself and the child while the castle burned. Blade traveled to a small village named Wyclif, where he settled down and raised the child as his own son. Eighteen years later, the son of Erik begins his quest.<br/><br/>The quest consists of travelling to towns and villages, battling creatures to gain experience and finding items such as swords, shields and armour, as well as many other items such as Herbs and Candles.

Initially, she started her working life in a beauty salon before the outbreak of war inspired her to move to London  and join the weapon industry. It didn&rsquo;t take too long for her to be noticed by the Secret Services; she was after all beautiful, athletic and had great attention to detail. It was only a formality that she was recruited into MI6 during Britain&rsquo;s darkest hours. Violette had lost an aunt during one of the first Luftwaffe bombing attacks and to further compound her heartache she later lost her RAF  husband in battle. However, Summer was strong willed and used these painful experiences to inspire her to succeed as a spy for the SIS.<br/><br/>Summer managed to carry out several missions successfully before being gravely wounded by a German sniper on a mission to kill Kamm, a German military intelligence officer. Comatose in a hospital in France, Violette relives key moments in a series of flashbacks. Hence the bulk of gameplay will take place during these flashbacks. The missions include blowing up a fuel depot on the Maginot Line, assassination of a colonel in a cathedral in Paris, stealing documents and marking a sub pen for bombers in Hamburg during Operation Gomorrah, and finding three secret agents in Warsaw. In the Warsaw sewers, she finds one agent seriously wounded (and silences him) and another dead by cyanide poisoning, but the third agent was captured; moving through the Warsaw Ghetto, where the residents were either rounded up or executed, Violette makes her way through to Pawiak Gestapo prison to give the last agent cyanide.<br/><br/>Through her memories, scenes from the hospital can be seen with two men arguing whether to keep Violette alive, give her up to the SS, or kill her to save her the torture if captured by the Nazis. Her location betrayed, Violette wakes from her coma to find Nazi soldiers storming the hospital. Escaping the hospital, Violette finds the villagers being murdered or rounded up by the Dirlewanger Brigade, a brutal SS unit of convicts, and taken to the church. Locking the villagers in, the soldiers set fire to the church. Violette is unsuccessful at trying to free the villagers, and due to emotional and physical exhaustion, collapses. The leader of the German unit is shown to be Kamm, whose face was burned by Violette's assassination attempt. In the end credits, Violette is shown in her hospital gown standing on a cliff overlooking a German plane.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Velvet Assassin&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81412": {"poll": [], "name": "John Deere: Drive Green", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Windows Edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic818911.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Driving"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["ValuSoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["ValuSoft"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic818911_t.jpg", "description": "No job is too big or small!<br/>Bale hay, mow fairways, plant soybeans or corn, spray or harvest corn and more -  it&rsquo;s up to you to do the job right!

The game supports up to two players, with each player taking the part of one of two snowmen Nick and Tom. Each player can throw snow at the enemies. The player must throw snow at each enemy until it is completely covered, when it turns into a snowball. An enemy partially covered in snow cannot move until it shakes it off.<br/><br/>Once an enemy has been turned into a snowball the player can roll it. The snowball will re-bound off walls, until eventually shattering against a wall. Any enemies the snowball rolls into are eliminated and other stationary snowballs start rolling when the rolling snowball touches them. If the player manages to take out all of the enemies with kicking one snowball (this one snowball may be used to make others bounce around as well and increase the chances to pull this trick off), money in the form of large green bills will fall from the sky. These disappear in a very short amount of time but are worth 10,000 points each, the most the player can get as a bonus.<br/><br/>Every tenth level there is a boss. Each boss can sustain being hit a number of times. After the 50th level, you play as one of the snow castle princesses.<br/><br/>When a player bowls an enemy over, it may drop a bottle of potion.

It is not as well-known as Madame Geoffrin's in Paris with regulars as Jaques Rousseau or the matematician Jean La Rond, but nevertheless a nexus for important and successful parlour tyrants, aristocrats, mysticians and literary people. A parlour where conversation has been honed to a beatiful art and where you can amuse yourself with carnal pleasures as night falls. This is a playground for philosophers, scientists, teologicians, administrators yet to become famous and to members of secret orders whose existance has yet to reach Paris. In an atmosphere of rollicking madness the most remarkable and noteworthy opinions are echoed between the walls of the parlour, eagerly accompanied by shrill laughter and false accusations.<br/><br/>After a bewildering night, to say the least, the characters are offered to investigate the death of the famous occultist &Uuml;bel Staal, to sort out a verbal dispute beween three gentlemen that have been going on for close to a decade.

These two inclusive compound pieces may step one and/or jump 2 squares, either or both, in either order, changing direction between step and leap if desired, with the hero moving orthogonally and the shaman diagonally. The final piece in the game is a war elephant, the equivalent of an unchained padwar from Jetan, a piece that may move 1 or 2 squares diagonally, changing direction if desired between the first and second steps. The combination of strong and weak pieces, of different ranges and abilities, allows a strategically and tactically rich game with piece balance and variety.

The shotgun weaponry allows a greater field of error for targeting an enemy in able to kill it. Both the machine gun and automatic shotgun allow the player to keep the trigger pressed down to unleash rounds.

In regular Tetris, the player manipulates a set of tetrominoes which fall into a two-dimensional pit (seen from the side). The aim is to solve a real-time packing problem by forming complete rows, which then disappear and score points. Poor play leads to incomplete rows, caused by inefficient arrangements of tiles; these rows do not disappear, giving the player progressively less space and less time to play subsequent pieces. Similarly, in Blockout, the player manipulates a set of polycubes which fall into a three-dimensional pit (seen from above; the pieces appear in the foreground and fall away). The pieces can be rotated around all three axes, and moved horizontally and vertically. The aim is to form complete layers.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Blockout&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "81481": {"poll": [], "name": "The Blues Brothers", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amiga edition", "Amstrad CPC edition", "Atari ST edition", "Commodore 64 edition", "North American Game Boy edition", "US DOS Disk Edition", "US DOS Floppy Disk Edition", "US NES edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1089563.png", "videogametheme": ["Crime", "Music"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform", "Scrolling"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Titus Software"], "videogamefranchise": ["The Blues Brothers"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Amstrad CPC", "Atari ST", "Commodore 64", "DOS", "Game Boy", "NES"], "usersrated": "13", "average": "6.38462", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Titus Software"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1089563_t.png", "description": "The Blues Brothers is a video game based on the band The Blues Brothers, where the object is to evade police in order to make it to a blues concert.

It was created by Titus and in gameplay is reminiscent of Capcom's Chip N' Dale series (1990), as well as Titus' own Titus the Fox. A sequel, Blues Brothers: Jukebox Adventure, was released for IBM PC and SNES in 1993 and for the Game Boy in 1994. The game received mixed reviews from fans of the film.<br/><br/>The characters have the ability to pick up objects (generally boxes) and either put them down to stand on them, or throw them at enemies. Each level is a variation on the jumping theme, with the characters finding a necessary attribute (e.g. a guitar) somewhere in the level.

Long ago, when the Leviathan first attacked the peaceful Floaters, there was one large island and one kind of Floaters. During the attack, the island split into many smaller islands. The four surviving Floater tribes were stuck on islands far from each other, with each tribe believing no one else survived. Over time, the tribes began to develop differently from each other.
