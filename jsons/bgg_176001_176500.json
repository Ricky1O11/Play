The game consists of four phases, each of which is divided into 22 rounds. During rounds, players perform certain actions. The first and second phase of the game reflect the regular phase of the war. The third and fourth phases  are constructed differently, because they represent a specific phase of guerrilla warfare.<br/><br/>The game uses the point to point system, six-sided dice and a deck of battle cards. The game map represents Cape Colony, Natal, Orange Free State and Republic of Transval. Each game phase corresponds to 3-9 months of real time. Military units (infantry, cavalry, artillery, tribals, machine guns, trains) are represented by abstract battle cards.<br/>During the game the players will carry out a series of operations (move, fight, events, special actions) using random actions (1 to 3 on the turn of the game).<br/>The introduced game events directly relate to historical events, directing the moves of players during the game.<br/><br/>Battle cards are used to resolve combat in situations when contact between commanders of military formations is established. In &quot;The Second Boer War 1899 - 1902&quot; the military units involved in the combat are presented on cards. Depending on the phase of the game or the commander involved the combat may be a battle or a skirmish.<br/>During the battle, players use six cards, although this number may be increased with the rules on the Boer trenches or British garrisons. Individual characteristics of commanders are also important.<br/>The British player can choose the cards that he intends to use in battle, but the Boer player draws them randomly &ndash; this describes the voluntary nature of the Boer army.<br/>The battlefield is divided into three sections - the right wing, the left wing and the center.<br/>The Defender begins the battle and places one card on each section. Then the attacker puts two cards for each section and performs troop morale checks. If the check fails, the card does not participate in the battle.<br/>Defender reveals the cards and adds one to each section, testing their morale. If players have a surplus of cards, they can use them on the sections of the battlefield, where there are less than two cards.<br/>Players compare their strength for each section. The player who achieved 2 or 3 successes, wins the battle. The opponent suffers losses - British cards goes into the reinforcements pool, and the Boer commandos cards are eliminated.<br/><br/>A skirmish is a smaller combat &ndash; the card limit is 3, but can be increased by the individual characteristics of the commander, the Boer fortifications or British garrisons. The British player can choose the cards he will use in a skirmish. The Boer player can choose one card, but he must randomly draw the other.<br/>The Defender places one card on each section of the battlefield. Then the Attacker does the same thing. For each card, he performs morale checks &ndash; a negative result means that the unit is not taking part in the skirmish, and can be replaced with a card from the surplus, if the player has it.<br/>Both players add the &ldquo;Strength&rdquo; value of their cards. The winner of the skirmish is the player, who achieved a higher score. If the loser is the Defender, he must vacate the occupied area.<br/><br/><br/>Bloody veld: Battle of Magersfontein, 11 December, 1899 (a tactical wargame).<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/>1 hex = 500 yd (457 m)<br/>1 game turn = 45 minutes<br/>1 counter = British infantry half battalion or part of Boer commando/cavalry regiment/artillery battery (Boer army: 1 gun).<br/><br/>Game description<br/>The game uses the standard hex-and-counter system, and ten-sided dice. Each hex represents 500 yards or 457 metres, each game turn corresponds to 45 minutes of real time.<br/>British infantry is represented by half battalions, cavalry by regiments, artillery by batteries. One counters represents a part of a commando or one gun.<br/><br/>Each game turn is divided into phases:<br/>1) Command phase &ndash; players use their Commanders-in-Chief and dispatch riders to give orders to subordinate commanders,<br/>2) Activation phase &ndash; after determining the initiative, players, using the Activation Markers, choose the brigade to activate. Activated units, move, fire, commence melee combat (only British units) and reorganize units and recover morale. The opponent can react by firing or counterattacking (only British units),<br/>3) Reorganization phase &ndash; players reorganize broken units.<br/>The principle of the game is based on an order system, which is associated with an action vector. The player must carry out the assigned order (of course, he gives them to himself), until the order is changed by the Commander-in-Chief, or the brigade commander manages to change it by himself. The order must be associated with a target hex (i.e attack hex, defend hex). The possible orders are: ATTACK or DEFEND.<br/><br/>The game tries to present the diversity of combatants tactics mainly through unit formations. <br/>British units may perform weapon attacks and melee attacks. Boer units can only fire, but they start the game masked, moreover, some of them can benefit from the trenches. It makes it difficult for the British player who cannot shoot at masked units from a larger distance. The fieldworks allow the Boers to minimize their losses.<br/><br/>The game treats the concept of zone of control differently from other games &ndash; it gives up the obligation to stop moving the unit in the enemy ZOC. The ZOC is a phenomenon that allows to fire or initiate close combat, and it is dependent on the units formation and the range of its firearms.<br/>Unit movement doesn&rsquo;t differ from other hex-and-counter systems.<br/><br/>Fire combat takes into account the distance to the target, the firing unit morale and terrain on which the target is currently placed. Artillery performs its fire in the same way, using another fire combat chart. Distinct units are the Boer Pom-Pom automatic guns. These cannons move like artillery, but actually perform their fire according to the infantry fire chart. Each shot, however, means performing two checks and summing the results of fire. The result of fire combat can be the loss of morale, combat efficiency level or routing. Additionally also withdrawal.<br/><br/>Melee combat is also based on the unit&rsquo;s morale, strength, formation, also the terrain. The effects of melee combat are almost the same as the effects of fire combat. The exception being the possibility of forcing the enemy to flee. Cavalry combat also includes the unit&rsquo;s momentum. Cavalry may react by counter-charging.<br/>The loss of unit&rsquo;s morale endurance during the game is marked with special markers.<br/><br/>"}, "176154": {"rpg": {"7700": "Devil's Crossroad"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Sorrow, Blood, and Vengeance", "rpgproducer": {"40900": "James Embry"}, "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2482719.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"271151": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"26965": "The Burning Plains"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2482719_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Disaster has befallen the boom town of Fool&rsquo;s Landing.

Players try to move through a labyrinthine game board in order to reach a desired symbol shown on a game board tile that matches a hidden card held by this player. The game board consists of a number of fixed tiles as well as rows and columns in which tiles can slide back and forth; these tiles show tunnels &ndash; T-shaped, straight, and otherwise &ndash; and a player can move his token only along the path as it exists on his turn.<br/><br/>At the start of his turn, however, he takes the one tile on the side of the game board and pushes it into a row or column of his choice, shifting the tunnels and pushing out one tile that the next player will use. This player now moves his pawn, and if he reaches the desired symbol, he reveals the card, then looks at the next card in his stack to see what he wants to reach next turn.

Gameplay takes place on two copies of the same game board that are separated by the game box so that they are not visible to one another. The Poseidon player throws powerful storms against the Navigators, driving them off-course and confounding them so that they cannot reach the Sacred Island in time. Only Poseidon knows the real position of the ships as indicated on his copy of the game board.<br/><br/>The navigators must sail through endless storms, blind to all around them, trying to gather clues to their whereabouts to stay on course.

Further, many of these feats are associated with a particular giant lineage (including cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, hill giants, storm giants, and stone giants), helping to differentiate the various giant species from one another, and also giving those types of giants easier access to the better feats in their particular lineage.<br/><br/>Whether you want to play a giant-blooded character with exciting giant-themed feats to prove that sorcerers aren&rsquo;t the only ones who can have bloodlines, or you&rsquo;re a GM who wants to make the next group of giants more unique and memorable, this book is for you.<br/><br/>"}, "176245": {"boardgamedesigner": {"76040": {"name": "Dennis Bennett"}}, "average": "6.82857", "poll": {}, "name": "Dune: The Art of Kanly", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": {"5838": "Dune"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2489869_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"76040": "Dennis Bennett"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2489869.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"271290": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "13", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "In this game of bluffing and deception, players try to gain influence over the different factions of the Dune universe.<br/>These factions (The Bene Gesserit, Fremen, Bene Tleilax, Ix, Sardaukar, Mentats, Suk doctors, Landsraad and Spacing Guild) are represented by face down cards, of which each player is dealt 2 at the start of the game and which give access to special actions.<br/><br/>Dune: The Art of Kanly is played out in a sequence of turns in which players use these special actions by claiming to have the necessary face down faction cards (This claim needn't be truthful and players can &quot;bluff&quot; ownership of any card they wish to use).

Unfortunately, the designer (there was only one in those days) quit the company before the game was completed.

Thus it was many years before the game was not only rediscovered but also correctly identified.<br/><br/>The player takes on the role of astronaut Taylor (from the 1968 movie) and retraces his journey. You begin in an ape-filled forest screen that essentially recreates the famous hunt scene from the film. If you're touched by a gorilla or orangutan you are captured and thrown into a cage in Ape City. Beyond these screens is the Forbidden Zone which is a series of desert and cave screens. If you find the right path you end up on a flashing screen with a half buried Statue of Liberty where you receive various bonus points and then start again in the forest on a higher difficulty level.<br/><br/>Although the game was never completed it is certainly at a very playable development stage and fans still speculate what the final version would have included.<br/><br/>"}, "176283": {"boardgamedesigner": {"81785": {"name": "Marc Santosusso"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Selectinomicon: Quest for Consent", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2485423_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2485423.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"271337": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "In times of extreme uncertainty, one may call upon the power of Selectinomicon and hope that indecision is the only thing  consumed.<br/><br/>Selectinomicon is a collaborative selection metagame which allows a group to come to consensus on a game by voting for various characteristics of games such as theme, mechanisms, weight, and length.<br/><br/>"}, "176284": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Domestic Dog Simulator", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"271338": "Windows Downloadable edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>You play a random dog breed in a randomly selected house and must explore the city and interact with the world.

There are 55 cards in one deck of LEXI Card Game. There are 52 letter cards; the number of each letter of the alphabet in the deck is according to the frequency of usage for each letter in the English language. There are two WILD cards which may be substituted for any letter of the alphabet. There is one (shortened) Rules/Score card.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the players set a goal of whatever score to be reached to win. (The winning score may be 100, 200, 500, etc.) Every player takes turns dealing. All players get nine cards each at the beginning of the game. One card is flipped open next to the deck, and both are placed at the center of play. The first player draws from either the deck or the opened card, but not both. He may lay down one or more words to be scored at the end of the round; he does not have to lay down any words. When this player is done, he discards one card. Play moves to the next player. All players will take turns playing. When it is a player's turn, he either draws one card from the deck or pick up card(s) from the open discarded pile. If the player draws from the discarded pile, he has to pick up all the cards from the card he wants to the latest discarded one and take it (or them) into his hand. This player has to play the bottom (oldest discarded) card he picks up and spell a word with it. He can, but does not have to spell words with the rest of the letter cards he picks up. When this player is done laying down words in front of him, he must discard one card. A player may add to an existing word he has laid down in a previous turn--by adding a prefix or a suffix--to form a longer word. For example: A player has laid down &quot;ALL&quot; in one turn, and has &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot; in his hand. In a subsequent turn, he picks up &quot;T&quot;. This player may add to the existing word, &quot;ALL&quot; and form &quot;TALLER&quot;. A player may only play and add to his own words and no one else's. For words to count toward a score, the words must be laid down in front of the player during his turn. If the words are not laid down when the round ends, those letters (forming a word) left in a player's hand will not count toward scoring. Moreover, one (1) point will be deducted for every letter left in a player's hand. All players must have taken at least one turn to spell words before the round may be ended. Only the player whose turn it is may end the round. To end a round, a player must use all his cards to spell one or more words, except one which must be discarded. Scores are added up according to the Summation principle:<br/><br/>1 letter word = 1 point; 2 letter words = 1+2= 2 points; 3 letter words = 1+2+3= 6 points; 4 letter words = 1+2+3+4= 10 points; 5 letter words = 1+2+3+4+5= 15 points; 6 letter words = 1+2+3+4+5+6 =21 points, etc.<br/><br/>The players play a new round and add up the scores. Rounds are played until the set score is reached. The first player to reach the set score wins.<br/><br/>"}, "176344": {"rpgitemversion": {"271441": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "X-plorers Advanced Combat", "rpgproducer": {"24205": "David Bezio"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2487080.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "rpg": {"2826": "X-plorers"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2487080_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The full advanced Combat rules by the creator of X-plorers RPG!

The adventures that fill the pages of The Spire will form campaigns that will unfold over time, though each adventure will also be designed to stand alone just as well, with little or no modification.<br/>     At the helm, we have veteran game designer, Darrin Drader, co-author of the 3.5 Book of Exalted Deeds, Forgotten Realms: Serpent Kingdoms,Forgotten Realms: Mysteries of the Moonsea, D20 Apocalypse, and many, many other titles for numerous RPG publishers. He brings with him fifteen years of professional game design experience, both in the tabletop RPG and MMO industries.<br/>     The Spire is also produced by Robert Blezard, and Patric L. Rogers, both of whom have produced thousands of pages of high quality RPG material, much of it freely available over the internet.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "176351": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Spire (Issue 1 - Spring 2015)", "rpgproducer": {"30800": "Robert Blezard"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2488352.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"27166": "The Spire"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"141124": "Beyond the Battlements"}, "rpg": {"25418": "5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"271448": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2488352_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Welcome to The Spire online magazine, which we hope will be your premier adventures periodical for the 5th edition of the world's most popular role-playing game!<br/><br/>Beyond the Battlements is an adventure for first and second level characters. The XP thresholds are designed for a party of five, but can be easily modified for one less, or up to two more player characters. Reducing or increasing the difficulty of each encounter to allow for different party sizes can typically be accomplished by adding or subtracting one creature. Additionally, some groups are better optimized or have more experienced players than others, which means that some might require a higher or lower degree of difficulty than what is presented here. The best rule of thumb is to gauge how the PCs are dealing with the challenges of the adventure and adjust the number of monsters as needed.<br/><br/>This adventure is designed so that a party of first level adventurers will reach second level before advancing to the second floor of the barracks, which would provide too great of a challenge for first level characters, so it is important to ensure that the PCs play through a fair amount of the ground floor and Uncivilized Arendan before moving on to the final encounters of this ad-venture. In the same vein, PCs who employ wit, guile, and stealth to avoid encounters should receive ad-hoc experience awards for doing so in order for them to reach level two before attempting the second floor.<br/><br/>Beyond the Battlements is the first adventure in the Retaking Arendan campaign. The tale begins when the player characters take on a commission to capture the gnoll, G&rsquo;aard&rsquo;k Bloodsnout, who has been given command over the goblinoid forces who patrol the streets of Uncivilized Arendan. Bloodsnout is unusually intelligent for a gnoll, and possesses a keen mind for strategy, troop development, and deployment. It is believed that capturing him will allow the king&rsquo;s forces in New Arendan easier access to the uncivilized portion of the city, and they will also likely learn important secrets about their enemy&rsquo;s operations.<br/><br/>"}, "176352": {"boardgamedesigner": {"81804": {"name": "John Sergott"}}, "average": "7.8", "poll": {}, "name": "Stoned: A Stone Snatching Game", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "5", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2488441_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"81804": "John Sergott"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29586": {"name": "Frugal Mule Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2488441.png", "boardgameversion": {"271455": "STONED: A Stone Snatching Game"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "STONED: A Stone Snatching Game is a card based game where the players pretend to be Cave people and try to collect more Stones than any of the other players.<br/><br/>On each turn a player can do only one of the following:<br/><br/>Take a Card (from the deck)<br/>Take a Stone (from the bank)<br/>Play a card (from their hand)<br/>Throw a Stone (from their pile)<br/><br/>These simple but various options keeps the game fast and fun.<br/><br/>"}, "176353": {"poll": {}, "name": "Wind 'n Find", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2060": "Pattern Recognition"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2572429_t.jpg", "average": "1", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29587": {"name": "Nabisco"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2572429.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"271461": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This is a children's board game printed on the reverse side of a Ritz Bits cracker box.

There are opportunities for action and gunplay, but for the most part this is an adventure about tough decisions and decisive action in other areas of human activity.<br/><br/>While the adventure is self-contained and has all the information a referee needs to run it, Borderland and Alien Module 1: Aslan may both be useful in expanding a campaign beyond these pages.<br/><br/>"}, "176464": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2490026.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"75002": {"name": "Nick Case"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"75002": "Nick Case"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"29015": {"name": "A-Muse-Ment"}}, "maxplaytime": "75", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2490026_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Single card to be included as an additional special card to increase game length or swapped in following the expansion rules for specials.<br/><br/>Obtainable from the A-Muse-Ment stand at UK Games Expo 28th-31st May 2015.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"271688": "First edition"}, "average": "5.33333", "name": "The Front Nine: Conference Facility of Excellence, Promo Card", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "8", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "3", "expands": {"156945": {"name": "The Front Nine"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"5652": "Sports: Golf"}}, "176465": {"average": "4.5", "poll": {}, "name": "The Great Toilet War (\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u5927\u6226\u4e89)", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2489854_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"79532": "Yoshiwo"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"28779": {"name": "purpurin"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2489854.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"271689": "Japanese first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "In The Great Toilet War (\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u5927\u6226\u4e89), the player passengers are riding on a train and competing for the limited number of toilets available so that they can do their business before things get messy and they need to return home for a change of clothes.<br/><br/>"}, "176466": {"boardgamedesigner": {"76414": {"name": "Katsumasa Tomioka"}}, "average": "7.3", "poll": {}, "name": "Fan & Mallet (\u56e3\u6247\u3068\u5c0f\u69cc)", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "34", "boardgamefamily": {"22783": "Admin: Better Description Needed!"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2489767_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"75070": "Yusuke Mamada"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"27665": {"name": "Table Cross"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2489767.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"271690": "Japanese first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Fan &amp; Mallet (\u56e3\u6247\u3068\u5c0f\u69cc) is a two player game in which one player takes on the role of the god of riches and the other assumes the role of the god of poverty in a friendly competition for control over a small village.  On their turn, each player places one of their god&rsquo;s followers on one of the buildings in the village.  Each god has the same two types of followers: Tsukumogami (Spirit Objects), household items possessing a soul that animates them and Zashiki-warashi (Kid Ghosts), playful child-like spirits.   Each follower has a strength value and once a building has five followers placed on it, the total strengths of each god&rsquo;s followers placed there are then compared.  Spirit Objects have a number that represents their strength, while Kid Ghosts have strengths that can vary through powerful special abilities which are triggered by the arrangement of other spirits at the same building.  If the strength of your faction is greater, you place one of your god&rsquo;s possession markers on the building.

All the players draw a hidden objective card which will give them their own personal agenda to fullfill. These agendas will most of the time lead to conflict of interest between the players. Objectives can be for example: to control the most of one kind of resource (eg. oil deposits, natural gas), to own public utilities or services of general interest (eg. Power, Water or Telecommunications) or to save the country (preventing the country from either falling apart in revolt or declaring bankruptcy) or ruining the country (to end the game before the 8th turn).<br/><br/>The game begins with each player drawing hidden objective cards<br/>Each turn, an event card is drawn, which will give flavor to the game as well as affect the policies and actions taken during that turn. <br/>Then, the players controlling the creditor countries, draw cards from the &quot;Memorandum&quot; deck and choose which policies they'd like to have adopted by the debtor country. In order to entice the Debtor, they offer the policies face down with a bribe card face up. Bribes can be either money or relief measures which give victory points and breathing space respectively to the Debtor player.<br/><br/>Memorandum policies enforced are now laws and are placed on the board. There are various categories of policies, such as budget cuts, salary reductions, etc.<br/><br/>The Debtor player may reject a Creditor's offer and hidden measure card but that will enable the Creditor to play a &quot;pressure&quot; card which usually has a negative effect on the Debtor.<br/><br/>While these policies are in effect, they provide victory points to the Creditor that proposed them, until a relief measure card of the same category is played which generally negates the policy card removing it from the game and depriving the policy's owner from it's victory points.<br/><br/>However, the creditors have a greater goal in mind. The country is rich in resources and properties which, while controlled, also provide victory points to their owner. To own a property, a creditor needs to pass privatisation policies, through which, he exchanges the debt owned to him for one or more properties.<br/><br/>That said, after a certain point in the game, there is a delicate balance to be maintained between happiness/unhappiness and the ever growing debt.<br/><br/>Enforcing measures has impact on the Debtor country, which sees it's people's happiness dropping and it's Debt rising. Should the people's happiness reach 0, the people rise up in revolt. Should the Debt reach it's maximum point, the Country declares bankruptcy. In either case, the game will end. Otherwise, the game ends in 8 turns. After the game ends in any of the afore mentioned ways, the players compare their victory points to declare the winner.<br/><br/>As a general rule, in order for the creditor player to earn victory points, he needs to control properties and to fullfill their hidden objectives to win the game, while any debt owed to him by the debtor player by the end of the game will be lost. On the other hand, the debtor player earns victory points from the bribes accepted, from the properties that remain public, from the happiness of his people (if any) and from the level of the debt (if he hasn't declared bankruptcy).<br/><br/>"}, "176489": {"rpgitemversion": {"271732": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Fate of the Amun-Re", "rpgproducer": {"24205": "David Bezio"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2494518.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "rpg": {"2826": "X-plorers"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2494518_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The full adventure by the creator of X-plorers RPG!

Rejected by both civilized and uncivilized societies, the gang remains on the move earning coin through mercenary contracts, assassinations, and their own nefarious schemes.  Often little more than bandits, the crew frequently runs afoul of regional leaders and the law.  The Vileheart Reavers learned long ago that adventuring is dangerous work, and it is far easier to ambush other adventurers while they are wounded and recovering and take their plunder than to seek riches on their own.<br/><br/>The group consists of violent individuals who do not always get along.  They have no moral scruples and will do anything for the right price, which for several would include betraying one another.  The Vileheart Reavers are a very physical team who rely mostly on strength and brute force.  Their magical aptitudes are crude, but powerful, and rely heavily on hedge magic, dark arts, and bloody rituals.<br/><br/>"}, "176024": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Order of the Five Winds", "rpgproducer": {"23702": "Rheanna Plemons"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2481303.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"270966": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"34942": "Gruesome Gangs"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2481303_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Gruesome Gangs is an exciting Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&reg; compatible product line providing the Game Master with a collection of non-player characters (NPCs) designed to work together from the perspective of backstory, game mechanics, or both.

They heavily favor melee combat with a healthy mix of stealth capability and some limited spellcasting.  Predominately non-human, they often operate on the fringes of society finding work as mercenaries and enforcers for various entities unconcerned with the nature of those they employ.  One of the Winds is a master of impersonating members of various religions and often leads others into ambushes after gaining their trust.<br/><br/>Most of the team cooperates well bound by honor, respect, or fear; however, the two monks share a growing hatred for one another that will likely lead to a betrayal.  The Order&rsquo;s leader is prone to bouts of unpredictability and violence, signs of his diminishing connection to his former humanity.  This is often observed when the team meets setbacks.  A series of well-planned and coordinated events will be punctuated by acts of extreme violence.<br/><br/>"}, "176025": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Lejends Magazine (Vol. 1, Issue 12 - Apr 2002)", "rpgproducer": {"1616": "Daniel Lewis"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2505750.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"26072": "Lejends Magazine"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"142291": "Adventure: An Evening at Pibin\u2019s Pub"}, "rpg": {"1276": "Lejendary Adventure"}, "rpgissueversion": {"270967": "First Printing"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2505750_t.jpg", "description": "From the Cover:<br/><br/>Within the Scroll:<br/><br/>Adventure - <br/>A Night at Pibin's Pub<br/><br/>A Deity of the <br/>Yarremic Pantheon<br/><br/>Xagig's Fables:<br/>Training Sans Merits<br/><br/>"}, "176026": {"rpgitemversion": {"270968": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Rorgorek Butcherblade", "rpgproducer": {"23702": "Rheanna Plemons"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"27136": "Nemesis NPCs"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Nemesis NPCs &ndash; Rorgorek Butcherblade introduces a dual-weapon-wielding hobgoblin taskmaster!

It takes place in the underworld where players take control over one of the nations struggling to survive among the dead realm. Players establish Houses and grant them lands, obtaining more Lords for their wars and intrigues. Through these Houses they also call armies or build mighty cities and strongholds for their nations. Their goals are simple: expanding borders and finally subjugating each other. During the gameplay the fifth player will lead diffrent force. Death, the original sovereign of the realm. In an attempt to recapture his lands, now lost to the living, he will pose a major threat to all the other players.<br/><br/>Easy to play/Difficult to master<br/><br/>The game can be played using Short Campaign rules (for 3 players, game time ~150 min) or Long Campaign rules (for 4-5 players, game time ~180-240 min). The basics of Nocturn are simple to learn and a game can start even with only one person fmailiar with rulebook and other players having only general idea about it. Gameplay favors not the players who blindly memorize all the rules but rather those who can scheme and think outside the box.<br/><br/>The possibilities on how to play Nocturn are only up to player imagination. <br/>As a player you can shut your nation inside a massive well defended valley surrounded by the mountains, waiting for an outside world to degrade into chaos. You can play as an agressor, focusing on conquering other players cities and strongholds while building few yourself. Or if you want to scheme in darkness, submit early in the game to the neigbour and deceive stronger players while engaging in secret actions destabilizing the world everywhere but in your lands. Still, you have to remember the World is constantly evolving around you with each passing turn. It may happen that your well devised plan will crumble - your Court taken by other stronger player, forcing you to wonder around with few loyal troops left, selling your services to whoever would give you a glimpse of hope.<br/><br/>Nocturn is played for 10 turns.

These increase the ability to have more players and include all of these great additional cards to the game with hilarious references and images by Randy Martinez.<br/><br/>Sitting Ducks Gallery is a hysterically fun, stick-it-to-your-neighbor, line manipulation game invented by Keith Meyers. Sitting Ducks is reminiscent of the classic carnival-style, midway shooting galleries, where players are trying to take out as many ducks as possible. Players move ducks and targets, take aim, and eventually eliminate other players&rsquo; ducks using a variety of humorous Action Cards, while trying to keep their own safe.  The goal is to be the last duck in the pond!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>In Sitting Ducks, each player gets their own group of ducks. Those ducks are shuffled together and form the Duck Deck, which then become the Duck line.<br/><br/>The Duck line is always in flux - when a Duck is removed; the other ducks move forward to fill the gap.  Certain cards can move the line forward, backwards or rearrange ducks in the line in your favor or your opponents. With the right cards, players may also move and manipulate targets to try to keep their own Ducks safe.<br/><br/>Eventually, you&rsquo;ll get caught snoozing and you will surely lose some of your ducks.<br/><br/>Lose all of your ducks, and you can no longer win the game.  But, one of the most fun aspects of Sitting Ducks is when all of your ducks have been eliminated from the game. Although you won&rsquo;t win, you&rsquo;ll still get a chance to exact revenge on the opponents who took you out and play Action Cards for the rest of the game!

Each player will be trying to gather information while cutting losses and revealing as little as possible. Elementals can sustain 2 hits, allowing players to take calculated risks and control an area with a bluffed piece.<br/><br/>The arena itself plays into the deduction process with its fountains (which provide tantalizing bonuses for matching elementals) and its energy wells (which generate crystals for special one-time maneuvers).

You've watched, like, a whole marathon of police TV shows last weekend and you think you've got the formula for justice all figured out. And if there's one thing you've learned about the criminal justice system, it's this: It doesn't matter if you're right or wrong, it just matters how good you can look in front of your boss.<br/><br/>Bad Detectives is a tile-based card game for 3-4 players, which takes approximately 45-60 minutes to play. Players take turns adding information to a network of Polaroid photos and strings, creating a map of the murder investigation. The players will use these strings to connect a Suspect, Weapon, and Crime Scene to the Victim. Once completed, the case is ready to go to trial.<br/><br/>However, solving the murder investigation is simply a means to an end. The true objective of the game is to be the detective with the most Evidence Points when the central case goes to trial. When a player adds a new card to the investigation, Evidence Points are put into play on the card as it is placed. However, these are only counted towards a player's final score if those cards are used to directly link the Victim to the most relevant Leads. To succeed, players will need to undermine the credibility of their colleagues, take creative shortcuts to justice, and put their contributions to the case in the places that matter most.<br/><br/>"}, "176121": {"rpgitemversion": {"271100": "Hardcover version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Phex-Vademecum", "rpgproducer": {"75467": "Stephan Naguschewski"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2480963.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": {"2005": "Aventurien"}, "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"608": "Das Schwarze Auge (DSA) (4th Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"19060": "DSA Vademecums"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2480963_t.jpg", "description": "user summary<br/><br/>A manual that provides all the information players need to add background and depth to their clerics of Phex, God of trade and cunning.
