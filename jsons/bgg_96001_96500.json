Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the animal species.<br/><br/>Dominant Species: The Card Game is a fast-playing game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous rescinding of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.<br/><br/>Players will use six major animal classes &ndash; mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid or insect &ndash; to further their goals in various terrain. Through wily card play, players will strive to become dominant at as many different terrestrial and sea biomes as possible in order to claim valuable victory points: It is survival of the fittest.<br/><br/>All of this leads to the end game &ndash; the final descent of the ice age &ndash; where the player who has accumulated the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>But somebody better become dominant quickly because it's getting mighty warm...<br/><br/>Dominant Species: The Card Game consists of ten rounds of competition, each round occurring on ten of the twelve different Biome cards. The player who starts a competition must choose to either play one Action card or pass.<br/><br/>Action cards consist of animals played to the table as well as events. Animals contribute their Food Chain values towards gaining valuable victory points at the various Biomes, and use their element icons to fight for control of the six Element resource cards. Animals can also sometimes suppress other animals, turning them from Healthy to Endangered, or Endangered to Extinct. Event cards can be powerful one-time effects or ongoing effects that last throughout the round.<br/> Play proceeds clockwise around the table in like fashion until every player has passed consecutively or when any one player has passed with an empty hand. At that point Element cards and the current Biome card are scored, with victorious players recording their gains on the Victory Point Track. If the competition is at a Tundra, one or more dominant players will advance one space on the Survival Track.<br/><br/>The current Biome card as well as all played Action cards are then discarded, and a new Biome card brought into play. Finally, each player draws (and perhaps discards) new Action cards based on his position on the Survival Track, and a new competition round begins. Play proceeds from Biome to Biome in like fashion until the game ends and a winner is determined.<br/><br/>Reimplements<br/><br/>    Dominant Species<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.06997", "name": "Dominant Species: The Card Game", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["120990"], "usersrated": "1163", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Evolution"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Garrett's Games 323 - Dixit Journey, Scripts and Scribes Dice, Dominant Species Card Game", "Podcast #038 - Mercaderes de la Edad Media", "The Gaming Gang Episode 47: X-Wing, Dominant Species the Card Game, Wonderland, Menzoberranzan, Andean Abyss, and More!"]}, "96261": {"poll": [], "name": "Cities XL 2011", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Russian Windows edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1005288.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Cities XL"], "videogametheme": ["Commercial / Public Transport", "Government / Politics"], "usersrated": "6", "videogamedeveloper": ["Monte Cristo"], "videogamegenre": ["Management", "Sandbox", "Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "6.41667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Akella", "Focus Home Interactive"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1005288_t.jpg", "description": "Imagine and Conceive cities of all types and sizes on Cities XL planet.

As pairs of symbols need capturing, if an any time a player has only one guard left they are eliminated - leading to a secondary win condition.<br/><br/>In each turn a player moves two guards eliminating (jumping over and removing) any opponets within reach. Chi symbols can only be occupied if capturing is not possible. There are 6 games, but as the rules (and aim) for each are identicle these seem to be more like variants rather than fully fledged games.<br/>Due to the mechanic of capturing these games play similar to checkers but the Chi matching alters the strategy quite well.<br/><br/>The six games are called: Tae Kwon Do (2 Players - Front Board), Aikido (4 Players - Back Board), Kung-Fu (4 Players - Front Board), Karate (2 Players - Back Board), Judo (2 Players - Front Board) and Jujitsu (2 Players - Back Board).<br/><br/>The theme of the game is martial arts, however this is not crutial and seems tacked on. The identical game would work, for example, with a space theme or a roman warrior theme.

Furthermore, such spells tend to frustrate those that suffer their effects rather than causing them harm directly.<br/><br/>Fireball is not a bothersome spell; it simply blasts creatures away. Animate rope, on the other hand, is a bothersome spell. In addition to tying a creature up, it can be used as a trip line, frustrating pursuit. Lightning bolt? Not bothersome. Grease? Bothersome. Disintegrate? Potentially bothersome. Bestow curse? Definitely bothersome. Mirror image? Very bothersome.<br/><br/>This PDF presents 12 spells in this vein.

The game includes an air game system, a ground system and unique rules where command and control are critical for movement purposes. Use of SAM missiles and SAGGER AT play important roles to keep the Israeli at bay. At first, it appears as a &quot;David vs Goliath&quot; battle because of the disparity of forces.

In many ways this guide became a showcase for Marcus Watney. The guide does the best when it deviate to other writers, mostly when the dogma of rehistorizing is abandoned. There were fewer variants and tools in this publication than its predecessors, but there were a couple redeeming points. There is also a small reference map on the back.<br/><br/>This is entered into the database not as a strategy guide, but as an expansion/variant of Rise and Decline of the Third Reich based on the alternate play content contained in the guide.<br/><br/>Included in the guide are:<br/>Record Keeping in Third&nbsp;Reich. This is a BPR record keeping sheet for covering 1 year of play. While superseded by spreadsheets and laptops, it is a useful tool for those players who prefer a more &ldquo;retro&ldquo; style.<br/>Grand&nbsp;Strategy&nbsp;in&nbsp;Third&nbsp;Reich: An Introduction to The Avalon Hill Game Company's Most Popular Strategic Game. An unabashedly biased introduction to the mechanisms and interactions of the game. Probably based on the second edition.<br/>The&nbsp;Fuehrer's&nbsp;War: German Play in the Third Edition. Game play considerations and notes for the main actor on the stage (after all, no Nazis-no game right?). Largely assumes German strategy follows the historical narrative.<br/>A&nbsp;Green&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pleasant&nbsp;Land: Sealion versus Cromwell. When Hitler's armies reached the coast of France, his war was won. Churchill, history and Third&nbsp;Reich don't see it that way. This article examines crossing the channel and removing the West Front problem.<br/>The&nbsp;Unsolved&nbsp;Problem: In Defense of France. Experienced players know that the longer France survives, the shorter Germany's life is going to be. Defensive options and workable counter attack strategies are the topic here.<br/>The&nbsp;Long&nbsp;Road&nbsp;from&nbsp;Rome: An Italian Strategy. Kesselring said, the Italian is not a soldier at heart. This article examines Italy as more of a threat than a power. Some Italian adventuring in the Mediterranean are discussed<br/>Soviet&nbsp;Options: Russian Play in Third&nbsp;Reich. Mostly a Russian survival guide, sometimes a German guide.<br/>BRP&nbsp;Warfare:&nbsp;The Clash of Economies. An odd article for those players with the leaning a mafioso investment banker. Some good nuggets, mostly because it deviates from the replay history theme.<br/>Diplomacy&nbsp;in&nbsp;Third&nbsp;Reich: Another Facet of the Strategic Game. More than anything else, this makes the guide worth reading. This a variant is based on minor country interaction from Origins of WWII. It removes the rather rigid minor country rules from the game and installs a competitive foreign aid-diplomacy system, with situational and event driven modifiers. One might think of it like the Vichy activation rule applied to everyone.<br/>Advanced&nbsp;Tactics: The Tricks of the Trade. Nuance is the word here.

It provides modified rules to adapt the science fiction game into a game based on Ancient Rome.<br/><br/>Author's introduction:<br/>Although Traveller concerns itself with interstellar travel, piracy, misadventure and dubious heroics along the starlanes, it is at its heart a simple generic system. It has to be, to cover tech levels ranging from stone age to an era of floating cities.<br/><br/>It is the game's unique trade and travel system, however, that is its real strength. Transferred to Earth's ancient world, Traveller should prove successful, capturing the spirit of sea travel, haggling dockside at Caesarea instead of Glisten, fleeing from customs boats off of Corinth instead of Rhylanor. Traders in the Roman empire criss-crossed the Mediterranean, keeping the imperial economy alive and thriving, middlemen, sailors, chancers, veterans all trying to make an almost honest living.<br/><br/>Mercator is, then, an attempt to transport Traveller's ethos and game systems almost directly to the Roman Empire in  the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. The Third Imperium becomes the Roman Empire, Regina becomes Alexandria, and goods like dried fruits or fish sauce are traded instead of machine parts or radioactives.<br/><br/>Many of the plots, stories and adventure hooks written for interstellar Traveller still work handsomely for a Roman campaign.  Scams, smuggling, theft, ambush, raids, piracy and so forth translate easily between universes.<br/><br/>This shouldn't be taken as an accurate historical RPG version of imperial Rome, but it isn't a magical fantasy, either. Mercator is supposed to be a game of adventure, and the Roman Empire is a well known and familiar world full of tropes, adventure seeds and above all inspiration!<br/><br/>User comment:<br/>The game is available as a free download from the Freelance Traveller website.

The last skill can cause some really devastating damage on the opponent.<br/><br/>The Monster and the Baron are equally sturdy - they both have 100 Life Points at the start of their respective campaigns.<br/><br/>"}, "96063": {"poll": [], "name": "Die neuen Eroberer", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Betting/Wagering", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic963934_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Abel Klinger", "ASS Altenburger Spielkarten"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic963934.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "First edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Goal: Be the first to dominate the market (gain more than 50%)<br/><br/>1.

The Wing Layer can be used to damage the enemy as well as canceling bullets to obtain combos. The Lock-On shot targets parts of the boss or bullets.

The last of his regulars are gone and he pauses a moment, curious at the soldiers darting about in the distance. Pennywell has been home to a Barracks since the Great War and tonight all is not quiet.<br/><br/>The bright evening stars illuminate a commotion as the distant figures can be seen running to and fro. The publican laughs as his wife joins him - &ldquo;I think the Army boys might have had one too many eggnogs, they&rsquo;re running about like headless chickens&rdquo;. &ldquo;Surely they won&rsquo;t be out training on a night like this?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Cracks of rifle shots blow in with the freezing wind, before a terrifying scream followed by a sudden silence. &ldquo;Lord in heaven&rdquo;.

Martial Law brings you a complete new set of cards with special powers, and features all-new vampires, werewolves, hunters and ghouls. Martial Law also introduces the feeding mechanism: Feed your chained orders to give them greater effect!<br/><br/>Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.<br/><br/>Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.<br/><br/>The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "average": "7.0781", "name": "Nightfall: Martial Law", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["143554", "98690", "105959", "143553", "101711", "127021", "124601", "105960", "119348", "111300", "100221", "105961", "119350", "95766", "143555"], "usersrated": "795", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Nightfall"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode Nineteen of The Gaming Gang", "Session Impressions: Nightfall: Martial Law"]}, "96153": {"statistics": [], "name": "Nintendo 3DS", "usersrated": "26", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1670214.jpg", "videogamehwversion": ["European Aqua Blue Nintendo 3DS", "European Cosmo Black Nintendo 3DS", "Japanese Aqua Blue Nintendo 3DS", "Japanese Cosmo Black Nintendo 3DS", "North American Aqua Blue Nintendo 3DS", "North American Cosmo Black  Zelda Limited Edition", "North American Cosmo Black Nintendo 3DS", "North American Midnight Purple Nintendo 3DS", "North American Pearl Pink Nintendo 3DS"], "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Console"], "average": "7.94231", "videogamehardware": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1670214_t.jpg", "videogamehwmfg": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "description": "The Nintendo 3DS is a portable game console produced by Nintendo, first released on February 26, 2011.

Unlike other North Africa wargames, there are 5 mini-maps located at the various termini of maneuver in the campaign, and where battles are waged as fascinating mini-games in their own right. Players try to sweep each map and force the action onto the next one in an effort to push their opponent out of the game.<br/><br/>The looming Malta factor is accounted for most assiduously. While abstracted into many aspects of the game, players must always be mindful of Malta being made active (helping the Allies) or inactive (assisting the Axis). The Italian forces have their rightful place in the story unfolding on the game board, and the remarkable paucity of units turns every counter and hex into the kind of wargaming puzzle reminiscent of the glory days of those great contests from the Avalon Hill General magazine.<br/><br/>The use of Supply Point markers, received in a fast, hassle-free way, to seize the initiative, replace losses and recover shattered formations, to light up a map and begin operations there (i.e., conduct player turns on it of maneuver and combat), and then to continue those player turns for another round. Each additional round of player turns must be paid for by another Supply Point, usually spent by the side that feels it is advantageous to press on and keep the opponent hard pressed, recreating simply and effectively the lulls and starts in battlefield operations that were a signature of this campaign.<br/><br/>The desert lies before you and World War II is at stake.

This isn't easy, because Kroko can scare them away.<br/><br/>How it is played: Each player gets eight &quot;monkeys&quot; and tries to move them towards the trees. Throwing a 1-4 means moving the same number of spaces. A 5 means you have to move one of your monkeys away from start. If you throw the Kroko side of the die, you give Kroko a push, i.e. you tip the crocodile-shaped spinner in the middle of the board. When Kroko stops, his big tooth points to a specific section of the board. All the monkeys in this area are scared and run back to the start.<br/>Special spaces include Kroko spaces (player has to push Kroko), spaces where a monkey is safe, and liana spaces which allow a monkey to climb to a free space in a tree. The game ends when all tree spaces are occupied.

The referee could assume one showed the adventure setting where particular Imperials were also involved (the player characters).  The Zhodani will go to great lengths to transport the characters to the expedition corridor.

In short, they'll do almost anything for nuts &ndash; and since you are a squirrel in Nuts!, you must now be as equally nut-crazed.<br/><br/>To start the game, each player receives one nut card &ndash; which come in values 1-5, with a single 7 pointer &ndash; and five cards from the play deck. The play cards go in your hand, and the nut is placed face up on the table in front of you. Play cards come in four types:<br/><br/>&bull; Grab cards let you grab a nut from another player's stash in various ways, for example, &quot;Grab any one nut card worth 4 or less.&quot;<br/><br/>&bull; Defense cards can prevent your nuts from being grabbed, e.g., &quot;Stop someone from grabbing one of your nuts.&quot;<br/><br/>&bull; Mayhem cards are bad things that can happen, e.g., &quot;Choose two other players. They must both miss their next turn.&quot;<br/><br/>&bull; Antics cards are ways that things do not go as planned when grabbing nuts, e.g., &quot;Draw the top card of the nut deck and put it in your stash.&quot;<br/><br/>On a turn, you first reveal the top nut card and add it to your stash. Then you play one Grab, Mayhem or Antics card on another player; that player may play a Defend card to possibly prevent your action. Instead of playing a card, you can discard any number of cards from your hand, then draw replacements from the play deck. As soon as someone has more than 20 points worth of nuts, the game ends and this player wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "5.71195", "name": "Nuts!", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "13", "usersrated": "612", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Party Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Animals: Squirrels"]}, "96189": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "statistics": [], "name": "Dark Side of the Desert", "rpgdesigner": ["Patrick Witmer"], "rpgproducer": ["Patrick Witmer"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1105204.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Tunnels & Trolls (5th - 5.5 Edition)"], "rpgcategory": ["Solitaire Adventure"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1105204_t.jpg", "description": "Introduction:<br/>Within the desolate Bric-Cact Desert lies the isolated town of Branis.

It is a no-frills core system &ndash; hence the name &ndash; and it assumes the reader is familiar with role-playing games in general. It includes rules for character generation and development, dice rolls to perform feats based on Attributes and Skills, and close-up and distance combat. There are also comprehensive rules for a generic form of supernatural activity referred to as MOSLI &ndash; Magic Or Something Like It. This could relate to magic in a fantasy setting, the occult in a modern-world setting, or psionic powers in a science fiction setting. There are examples of weapons and armour to guide the Game Master (GM), a few miscellaneous rules, and a little guidance on creating your own settings.<br/><br/>Pith is a bare-bones system that seeks to balance a satisfactory degree of realism with ready playability. Character management, rolls, MOSLI and combat have all been designed to be interesting for the players, yet universally applicable.<br/><br/>What is not included is any particular setting. World details, non-human races, monsters and details of equipment and economics must be provided by the GM, if needed, though this work is creative rather than mechanical. However, the detached and universal nature of the rules gives the GM and the players the freedom to enjoy adventures in any setting, without purchasing extra materials or learning new systems. Characters could even transfer from one setting to another without adjustment.<br/><br/>Pith also permits the GM to choose the die used for Attribute and Skill rolls, so that the degree of chance in a particular role-playing session can be readily controlled. This unusual feature contributes to different &lsquo;styles&rsquo; of play &ndash; from serious and realistic to lightweight and fun.<br/><br/>Pith itself is free and always will be.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "96192": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jason C.

It is played with a custom deck of 54 cards in 4 suits (with values ranging from 1 to 10) but can be played with a normal deck with slight modification.  A print-to-play edition exists.<br/><br/>The story of the game is that a bird named &quot;Cody&quot; is trying to steal coins from the players.  At the start of the game each player gets 3 coins.  At the end of each round one of the players will wake him up and he will then steal a coin from the weakest player at that time.  Players try to avoid having the worst hand at the time that the bird wakes up.  The game ends when all but one player have lost all of their coins.  Players have to decide when it's to there advantage to try to force the end of a round -- but trying to end the round may invoke a penalty and often results not in the end of the round but in a sneak peek at a trump card which affects scoring.<br/><br/>Basic Gameplay:<br/><br/>At the start of each round, the dealer (who rotates clockwise after every round) shuffles the deck and deals 3 cards to each player, and then shuffles 2 random cards along with the special Cody-the-Bird card and sets these aside face down as the &quot;nest&quot; pile.  The dealer then places the remaining cards face down in a draw pile, and turns the first one over face up as the discard pile. Starting with the player to the dealer's left and going clockwise, a player's turn consists of either: Taking the top face down card from the draw pile, or taking the top face up card from the discard pile, or knocking on Cody's Nest door.<br/><br/>If the player chooses to take a card, they then immediately discard one card from their hand face up on the discard pile and play proceeds clockwise (exception: once per round players may &quot;bury&quot; their discard face down). If they choose to knock on Cody's door, they take a peek at the top card in the Nest.  If it's Cody the Bird, then it is turned face up and everyone has one more round to try to get a better hand.  If it's not, the peeked at card is set aside in a special &quot;Trump&quot; pile, and the player who peeked has some advance information about how hands will be scored at the end.  There are also a few special cards that allow players to perform actions out of turn.<br/><br/>The round ends when Cody the Bird is revealed, and at that point hands are scored and the lowest scoring player loses a coin.  Hand value is based on:  The sum value of up to 3 cards of the same suit, OR having a 3-card straight of the same suit (33 points), or having 3 cards of same face value (33 points).  But having cards in a revealed trump suit will decrease the hand score.  There is also a penalty for being the player to knock on Cody's Nest and end the round.<br/><br/>Strategy:<br/><br/>While there is a lot of luck in the game, there are some real strategic elements as well.  Players must decide which cards to hold and draw that will be most likely to give them the highest scoring hand.  To do this they must consider which cards have already been discarded and they must take into account the information they reveal to other players when they discard or choose a face-up discard card.  In addition, players must decide when they have a good enough hand to take the risk of trying to end the round -- knowing that they will pay a scoring penalty for doing so.  The moment when a player &quot;Knocks on Cody's Door&quot; is typically accompanied by curses and laughter as players find out if the round is really ending, or if a Trump suit is being revealed that will help or hurt them, and make emergency plans to quickly improve their hand before the round ends.<br/><br/>"}, "96195": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Gamemastery Flip-Mat: Necropolis"], "poll": [], "name": "Gamemastery Flip-Mat: Necropolis", "rpgartist": ["Corey Macourek"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1056771.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "6.5", "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["Paizo Publishing", "Steel Sqwire"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["GameMastery", "Pathfinder Flip-Mat"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1056771_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>The corpses of fallen heroes and the spirits of the unquiet dead all end up here, in the haunted paths of the Necropolis!

The roads themselves are multi-lane with brief divided road sections.<br/><br/>The object of the game is the same as in previous installments in the series: When all courses are completed without getting &quot;Game Over&quot; or &quot;Busted&quot;, in 1st, 2nd or 3rd out of 14th place, the level will increase. Differences affected on tracks are the length and the amount of traffic on the road, with the additions of heavier fines from the police if the player is caught, and a larger reward for completing the track.<br/><br/>The player could choose a character to play as, which came with a specific cash amount and a personal motorcycle.

The game's turns go like this. Instead of playing individual countries for individual players, my rules NOW have all the countries going together at the same time, the incomes are still separate and Japan still controls Japan's income, etc, but NOW ALL players will conduct their turns all at one time, with separate incomes for separate countries and they will all purchase their units at the same time, their turns at the same time, placed on the same &quot;Place Units&quot; board on the game and all playing pieces are color-coded like the regular game. Germany spends income on Germany's pieces and places them in German-held territories with industrial complexes, and Britain does the same, etc on down the line.<br/><br/>United States is NOT at war with anyone and therefore cannot declare war, unless and Axis player declares war on it first or after its 3rd turn for example, like in the real Global game.<br/>The question of ownership of the Dutch territories in the game has been solved. Players will no longer need to land grab the Dutch territories in the wake of Hollland's collapse. Instead, ownership will go to the United Kingdom because they control and are patrons of the Dutch Govt in Exile in London  and the Dutch Govt. In Exile is under British control, therefore they belong to the United Kingdom. They will receive the usual bonus for having posession of them. See my PDF document for additonal changes.<br/><br/>The goals of the game are similar to a regular Axis &amp; Allies game. The Axis will capture London, Paris, Kiev, Moscow, and Washington. The Allies will capture the Axis capitals of Tokyo, Berlin, and Rome.<br/><br/>The players are France, Soviet Union, Italy, United Kingdom,(Pacific and Europe) and USA.  The goals for the Axis and the Allies are the same as Europe 1940 and Global 1940. Nothing's changed there.<br/><br/>The Allies capture the Axis capitals of Berlin and Rome.<br/><br/>The rules are the same as regular Axis &amp; Allies.<br/><br/>I wanted to expand upon the whole Axis &amp; Allies game by adding more to it.  This pack also adds new territories, such as Crimea. Crimea is now important for control of Sea zone 125 as it was in real life. The Black Sea Fleet is also represented with one Battleship and 1 destroyers, and 1 Transports. The Romanian fleet and Russian fleet will inhabit the same waters, but Romania will not be at war until Germany is at war with the Soviet Union because Romania and Hungary are controlled by Germany.<br/><br/>There also new rules regarding the setup.<br/><br/>Germany will receive 1 Major Industrial Complex in Romania to represent the Ploesti oil refinery, which was a large portion of Germany's oil production and gasoline in World War II and 1 Major Industrial Complex for Slovakia-Hungary, which was a large portion of Germany's armaments production that supplied the Germans with the tanks they used to invade France in 1940.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "0", "name": "Xtreme Global 1940 Xpansion Mod  (fan expansion for Axis & Allies Europe 1940)", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Axis & Allies"]}, "96241": {"rpgartist": ["Carl Frank", "Llyn Hunter", "Val Mayerik", "Cristina McAllister", "Raven Mimura", "William O'Connor", "Eric Polak"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Crow's Nest  (Issue 2A - 2000)", "rpgdesigner": ["Rob Vaux", "Kevin Wilson"], "rpgproducer": ["D.
