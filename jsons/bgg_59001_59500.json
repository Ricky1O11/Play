There are horrors the like of which has never been seen before - demons wrought from pure rage, vast undead that prowl the ocean depths and hags that harvest the teeth of children to create their disturbing fortresses. There are allies in the fight against evil - the glorious metal angels hailing from a world where there is no organic life, the spirited anachras seeking to set right the wrongs imposed on the innocent and weak , and the citywardens watching the streets with a careful eye. There are courts of capricious fey, armies of lethal constructs and legions of monstrous aberrations that should never have seen the light of day nor been even conceived of in the minds of those who made them. There are vengeful spirits, devious fiends and undead thirsting after the deaths of all who live - literally, in the case of the parched zombie.<br/><br/>This Monster Encyclopaedia describes all these creatures and far more. Each monster is fully detailed with artwork, provided with its own set of statistics under the 3.5 edition of the d20 rules and with descriptive text for a GM to read out to fearful Players when they first encounter it.

Is a musictherapy the right treatment for the vegetarian cat? Show that you have the courage, the right tactics and the necessary pinch of luck to become the chief physician .....<br/><br/>You work as veterinarians in a nutty pet clinic. The animals there are not really ill but<br/>a little strange. The patients cards show how many therapy points are needed to heal the patients. To gather therapy points you have to deal with the strange therapies in the nutty pet clinic.<br/><br/>Every therapy card is worth at least one therapy point. In order to cure your animal patients it requires a lot of therapy cards. Therapy cards are uncovered one after the other and placed in a row. Whoever thinks that enough therapy cards are displayed places his doctor figure below the last uncovered therapy card, since as soon as a second therapy card of the same kind is uncovered, chaos breaks out in the nutty pet clinic, ending this phase of the game immediately. Whoever has placed his doctor figure in time receives one therapy point for every uncovered therapy card up to his doctors figure, the others are left empty-handed.<br/><br/>To gather a larger amount of therapy points, the players have to use the special functions of the clinic rooms on the gameboard. Having gathered enough therapy points the players place their feeding bowls in clinic rooms. With the feeding bowls the players gather more therapy points so that they can cure the stranger patients. <br/>So it's up to the players to seek a career in the nutty pet clinic and reach the upper clinic floors.<br/><br/>Action cards allow special actions and provide surprising events.

With the Mythic System, your swordsmen and rogues will be able to take a more direct hand in constructing what will be their most prized possessions, giving them a greater sense of ownership and accomplishment.<br/><br/>No two magic items will ever be the same again.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "59111": {"rpgdesigner": ["Adrian Bott"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Soft Cover"], "poll": [], "name": "Sovereign Magic: Mastery of the Land", "rpgartist": ["Brent Chumley", "Anthea Dilly", "Vincent Hie", "Tony Parker", "Philip Renne", "Alejandro Villen"], "rpgproducer": ["Ian Belcher", "Alexander Fennell", "Ben Hesketh", "Paul Tucker"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic673133.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "5.66667", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Eye on Mongoose"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Encyclopaedia Arcane"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic673133_t.jpg", "description": "From the intro:<br/><br/>&quot;The wizard is an archetype of power. With courage and discipline he ventures into forbidden mysteries, learning the spells which may melt down reality and remould it closer to his heart&rsquo;s desire. Once the heady heights of ninth level spellcasting are attained, the magician is believed to be at the apex of his power. However, there are those for whom this is just the beginning.<br/><br/>These are the sovereign mages, those who have learned the rare art of entering the soul of the land and binding their personal power to it. Not content with merely moving upon the face of the earth, they seek to become one with it; some to conquer, some to protect. By infusing their very essence into the country around them, they partake of the energies of the land, drawing upon it to achieve legendary and miraculous results. The wild beasts of the region seem to know and obey them. Some even send forth weird allies and emissaries, whose eyes and ears the sovereign mages may use and through whom they may speak. Some, the darker ones, are even said to take possession of important figures against their will. Whether they serve as governors, custodians or power-mad conquerors, they are a more potent magical force than any ordinary spellcaster could hope to be. The more land they take over, the more their ability to influence it grows. Their arcane spellcasting abilities are augmented massively and they become able to cast spells over huge distances, raining down their magic upon the unwary who had thought themselves safe in far-off lands.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "59112": {"rpgdesigner": ["Adrian Bott"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Soft Cover"], "poll": [], "name": "Tomes and Libraries: Secrets of the Written Word", "rpgartist": ["Eric Bergeron", "Jon Hodgson", "Drew Langston", "Danilo Moretti", "Tony Parker", "Stephen Shepherd"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic673143.jpg", "usersrated": "4", "rpgproducer": ["Alexander Fennell", "William James", "Paul Tucker"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "average": "5.25", "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Encyclopaedia Arcane"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic673143_t.jpg", "description": "From the intro:<br/><br/>&quot;Although wizards and libraries are so often connected, very little time has been spent on exploring the function and powers of the library. Libraries usually turn up as scenic backdrops or repositories for purely magical resources, whereas there are more potentially useful books in a library than there are supplies in an adventuring gear shop. We will therefore be taking a long overdue stroll down the library aisles and finding out how to use its stored wisdom to our best advantage. Magic-using characters, who have more of a natural inclination towards reading than characters of other classes, will find an abundance of new ways to apply the knowledge set down in their books - and a whole lot of new books to go searching for!<br/><br/>Players of any class who prefer to use their brains as well as their sword arms will find new roles to play and new ways to tackle the challenges they encounter. Strength can see you through a tough battle, health can keep you standing when you are wounded and luck can sometimes get you out of trouble; but knowledge can trump any of these, because knowledge can find ways of applying strength more efficiently, avoiding wounds in the first place and substituting a blind trust in fate with advance planning.

Although it seems to only have been published in 2009, the copyright on the rules is 1985, and the approach of the tennis game (a good serve is always followed by the server going to the net for a volley, for example) dates from that era.<br/><br/>The 'basic' game is a D6 dice game, with no skill involved. The throw for the serve decides whether it is an ace, a fault, or in play resulting in either a groundstroke rally or the server at the net. Subsequent shots in the rally can be winners or faults, change the positions of the players (at the net or baseline) or keep them as is. There are slightly differing shot results for each die roll, depending on the positioning of the players, and what sort of shot is played (passing shot or lob when the opponent is at the net, smash or volley when you are at the net).<br/><br/>The 'advanced' game follows the same format as the dice game, but allows players to have cards that can be used instead of a throw of the dice. The number of these cards is limited, so there is some player judgement as to when best to play them, or roll the die. 3 Cards are given when serving (presumably so the server usually has more cards than the receiver, and thus an advantage) and 1 card for the winner of each game. The cards either are the equivalent of throwing a &quot;6&quot; (e.g. Service ace, passing shot winner, or the &quot;hit glorious and impossible winning shot&quot; (which can be beaten by another one!) ) or introduce another event such as a let or foot fault on the opponent's serve.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>2 D6<br/>2 die shakers<br/>pack of 52 cards <br/>drawstring bag<br/><br/>"}, "59127": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic624746.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Richard Borg"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Cyrille Daujean"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Days of Wonder"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic624746_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "From DoW website:<br/><br/>The Sword of Stalingrad expansion features 2 large-scale ready-to-play Overlord Scenarios;  2 standard scenarios; new Summary cards for the previously published Battle Maps and Mediterranean Theater expansion; and, for the first time, additional cards for in-game play - the new Combat Deck specifically designed for urban warfare.<br/><br/>Sword of Stalingrad<br/><br/>Holed up in a Grain Elevator overlooking a strategically vital square, you just watched the South  Railway Station change hands 14 times in the past 6 hours.

It covers the conspiracy's history and goals; it's thirteen component groups; their rivalries and alliances; the movement's current projects, and the puppeteers that pull the strings behind the scenes.  Three groups are described in minute detail, along with their current schemes, resources, respective ideologies, and key agents.   Also featured is the Veiled Tribunal, an independent intelligence agency dedicated to the Core's security, along with a new character profession: the counter-espionage agent.<br/><br/>The book's second section is a complete adventure, Broken Sanctuary, featuring the machinations of the Thirteenth Wheel.  The player characters take on the role of special operatives for the Veiled Operatives to investigate the mysterious events occurring to an isolated Secure Stock A.E.S. orpee repository at its adjoining town, an eerie place harboring sinister secrets.  As the investigation progresses, evidence reveals a complex web of intrigue with ramifications that hint of a far greater menace.<br/><br/>With over 20 game aids, an extended character index, and mysterious revelations galore, Broken Sanctuary can be played either on its own or as the first volume of the greater Thirteenth Wheel campaign.<br/><br/>"}, "59137": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic974068.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1984", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "5", "boardgamepublisher": ["Spear's Games"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic974068_t.png", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game"], "description": "Each player plays a rabiit which moves around a game board.

But while their lives may seem simple, among them walk the Angelions, immortals that have kept the dark technology of the First Age alive and hidden. For two thousand years, these silent ghosts have watched over the mortal masses from the shadows, using forbidden crafts to bless the virtuous with long life and reward the malicious with swift death.<br/><br/>What You Can Play - Thrust into the turbulent time known as the Second Age, players of Lesser Shades of Evil create and play mighty Angelion characters in the years immediately following the great treachery; divided, scattered and leaderless, they roam the world as digital ghosts, wandering from flesh to flesh, known by many names and possessing many forms. They may speak from the mouth of a child but bite with the jaws of a snake; they may walk using the legs of men, fly over cloud using the wings of birds or swim in the seas using the fins of fish. Their mortal forms may perish, but their essence lives on.<br/><br/>&bull; 456 pages lavishly illustrated by the genre&rsquo;s best artists, such as Torstein Nordstrand, Larry Elmore and Martin McKenna<br/><br/>&bull; A rich setting detailing the mythical Second Age of the world; its history, its wonders and its countless dangers<br/><br/>&bull; A point-based character generation system that allows players to build any character, from simple and wide-eyed mortals up to Rogue Golems, Awakened operatives, monstrous Archfiends and the mighty Angelions themselves<br/><br/>&bull; Cinematic rules - a ruleset that allows players to use six-sided, ten-sided or twenty-sided dice according to the challenge they're facing and the risks they're willing to take<br/><br/>&bull; And much more!<br/><br/>"}, "59172": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "The Magic 270", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic611677_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cardota Games Co.", "The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic611677.jpg", "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Political"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "The Magic 270 is an election game where you can become President of the United States by combining a lucky hand and strategic abilities.<br/><br/>By rolling a die and choosing where to place winks you can fight for all 50 states and Washington, D.C.<br/><br/>Winning a state (also D.C.) and getting all the electoral votes of that state happens if you gather a majority of the votes of the state.<br/><br/>There are currently 538 EV in the Electoral College.

Different!<br/><br/>The MEGA Role-Playing System is the first RPG of a new generation. The Norwegian inventors have provided a set of rules which contain all of the qualities most desirable to GMs and players.<br/><br/>The qualities are:<br/><br/>Playability: The system developed due to disatisfaction with those games already available. Extensive play testing and continual improvement has made it a highly playable game. The rules have been designed to reflect real life making it simple to play.<br/><br/>Realism: There are no artificial limits placed upon the abilities and skills of the character. Extensive equipment lists and realistic prices enable the character to be well equipped. There is also enough background information on things such as weather, religion and NPCs to allow the creation of a realistic campaign world.<br/><br/>Combat: Although not designed for the &quot;hack-kill-slay-brigade&quot;, the combat system will allow any fights to be resolved quickly and easily. Combat is highly realistic without being too complex.<br/><br/>Also it is:<br/><br/>Easy to learn for the GM: The same principles have been used for attributes, skills, combat and magic. Therefore familiarity with the character creation and improvement is rapid. Most of the vital information has been compiled in easy to read tables making it very accessible.<br/><br/>Easy to learn for the players: Only minimal knowledge of the rules is required to create and run characters therefore they can enjoy playing the game.<br/><br/>Complete: All necessary information for running a game is contained in this volume.<br/><br/>Interesting: The good character generation system gives abilities according to previous experience. This means that a new character is unlikely to be unsuitable for adventuring. Furthermore, the players can play any creature (usually intelligent) within the GM's campaign world.<br/><br/>Flexible: The rules are flexible enough that any real-life situation can be catered for by the GM. They can also readily accomodate new skills, weapons, magic and spells, etc. The system is well suited for running an already existing campaign as it is easy to adapt. It is easy to change weapons, skills, spells or creatures without destroying the game balance.<br/><br/>Fun: All of the above leads to the basic requirement of all games - IT IS FUN TO PLAY.<br/><br/>"}, "59185": {"rpgdesigner": ["Isy Allon", "Ben Brakas", "Petter B\u00f8chmann", "Atle Rinvold"], "rpg": ["The MEGA Role-Playing System"], "statistics": [], "name": "Ogre Forest", "rpgartist": ["Artyfax", "Petter B\u00f8chmann", "J\u00f8rgen B\u00f8chmann", "Rune Isene"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic580597.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Softcover version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["MEGA Games Ltd."], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic580597_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>From the back of the book<br/><br/>This module is designed to give starting adventures for inexperienced characters, players and GMs. It contains two adventures, Ogre Forest and The Return of Twain Alderyn in addition to five special encounters.

Wars present.<br/><br/>In the 3050's, the discoveries of long-buried Star League records led to a plethora of new cutting-edge BattleMech and vehicle designs by the end of that decade, resurrected from the blue prints of design firms centuries old and thought lost to antiquity. Now, ten years later, these designs have moved from novelty to workhorse, as the Inner Sphere once more finds itself at war!<br/><br/>Fully updated to circa 3070, Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade - launches these designs into the current time frame, including notable MechWarriors/crews, as well as new variants. Additionally, a battle armor section has been included, providing full Classic BattleTech stats, and updating the histories for these twenty venerable designs.&quot;<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This upgrade volume is one of a series of Upgrade titles produced to provide new material for gamers and collectors, rather than replacing the original Technical Readout upon which they're based. The Technical Readout 3058 Upgrade is a companion volume to the Technical Readout: 3058, rather than a replacement. Although the two may seem similar the 3058 Upgrade expands the detail up to 3070, adds personality entries, many new Mechs, new sections on Battle Armour and generally provides new material.

It wasn&rsquo;t a plague.  It wasn&rsquo;t even the New World Order.  It was a computer virus.  4 years after the turn of the millennium, five High School teenagers with nothing better to do, conjugated one weekend to write a computer virus.  All they wanted was to make a name for themselves.  Instead, they accidentally spread their electronic disease all over the world causing the collapse of every major system on the planet.  A single mind can create a good virus.  However, with five minds, you have human error and miscommunication to take to account.  Together they started it.

Every thought, every action resonates throughout reality. Actions and thoughts intersect, collide, contradict, and merge together to form the fabric of cause and effect that make up &lsquo;reality&rsquo; as people understand it.<br/><br/>Most people express their power to change the world though their bodies. They take up swords or tools, craft words or art. A handful find they wield incredible arcane or divine powers, changing all of creation by moving forces they barely understand.<br/><br/>A rare cursed few do not suffer the limits that constrain mortal men. They alter the shape of the universe by will alone. They move mountains, light forest fires, transport themselves though time and space without drawing on anything but themselves. They have what many would consider the ultimate gift; to transform thought into definite action unbound by the constraints of the physical world. This ultimate gift brings with it a terrible curse. Each world shaper must maintain constant focus, constant control over the power within. A stray thought could become a bird. A flare of anger may ignite an inferno that destroys a town. Unbridled by the buffer of physical action these gifted individuals must struggle constantly to establish boundaries on their own desires. Even a moment&rsquo;s failure can bring ruin to everything they hold dear.<br/><br/>They are the world shapers, world breakers, dreamers and destroyers. Where they walk, reality itself bows down.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "59372": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jonathan Bernard", "Chad Brouillard", "Erik A. Dewey", "Chris Doyle", "Daniel Gent", "R.
