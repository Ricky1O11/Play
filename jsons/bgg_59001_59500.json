However, the finished game was only half the game I really wanted, so I have continued to add to it - adding more skills, rules for wound recovery, expanded weapon tables, updating the character sheet, adding some rules for gaining hero points after adventures and some adventure and mission ideas.<br/><br/>I decided on a traditional style of role-playing game, where characters are created by assigning attributes and skills and so on because the old-fashioned feel of the game seemed to warrant it.<br/><br/>The game is inspired by recent events in Iraq, The Eagle has Landed (book by Jack Higgins and movie starring Michael Caine), The Secret Army, lots of movies about the resistance in France and so on, and an old West End Games rpg by Greg Costikyan called The Price of Freedom. I suppose I can't talk about the HomeGuard without also mentioning Dad's Army and although this game is not a comedy, much is owed to that famous British sit com.

Designed for D&amp;D&reg; v3.5, this supplement is an invaluable resource on all things gnome and kobold, and usable by players and Dungeon Masters&reg; in any campaign setting. Remember, being small doesn't mean you can't think big!<br/><br/>GNOMES: This section is nothing short of a player&rsquo;s guide to gnomes, providing everything you wanted to know about their culture, as well as providing an in-depth look at playing a gnome. For those of you interested more in the game mechanics of this race, there are new feats and prestige classes. For others, the wealth of background information will enable them to bring their characters to life in a unique culture.<br/>The gnome section is broken down into three key chapters, one for each sub-race. Certain aspects of gnomes are very similar to all the sub-races. As such, rock gnomes are treated as the base race, with only the differences highlighted in the forest and deep gnome chapters. Each chapter in turn is broken down into several sections, with each section covering a single aspect of gnome daily life.<br/>Section One explores the physical and mental make-up of gnomes.<br/>Section Two explains gnome social structure, detailing the social strata and providing a close look at how gnome communities function.<br/>Section Three covers gnome culture, looking at every aspect of their wondrous society.<br/>Section Four is dedicated to warfare and details unit organization, weapons and armor, and tactics.<br/>Section Five expands on the gnome religious beliefs, detailing their deities, ceremonies, and beliefs.<br/>Section Six looks at misconceptions of gnomes and the truth behind some of the more common fables.<br/>At the end of the gnome book are two sections covering the crunchy bits. The first section gives the player everything he needs to know about playing a gnome, as well as new feats and prestige classes suited to the race. The second provides the DM with ready-to-use statistics for a variety of gnome archetypes.<br/><br/>KOBOLDS: As a sourcebook, this section is designed for both players and DMs alike. Players will find a wealth of information for playing kobold characters, with new feats, prestige classes, spells, and magic items for their characters to wield &ndash; enough information to give them as much depth as any of the standard races. DMs can use the same information to move kobolds up the ladder from &ldquo;cute little monsters&rdquo; to major threat, giving players a chance to learn the truth about these long neglected creatures through role-playing.<br/><br/>Section One details the history of the kobolds, from their origins to the present day.<br/>Section Two explores the physical and mental make-up of kobolds.<br/>Section Three explains kobold social structure, looking at how a clan is governed, and the dynamics of the tribe.<br/>Section Four covers the kobold culture, looking at every aspect of this unique and often neglected aspect of kobolds, including their use of alchemy.<br/>Section Five is dedicated to warfare and details unit organization, weapons and armor, and tactics.<br/>Section Six expands on the kobold religious beliefs, detailing their belief in ancestor worship and their ceremonies and beliefs.<br/>Section Seven looks at misconceptions of kobolds and the truth behind some of the more common beliefs.<br/>Section Eight gives the player everything he needs to know about playing a kobold, as well as new feats, spells, and prestige classes. <br/>Section Nine is a bestiary, providing a list of standard kobold adversaries ready for instant use.<br/><br/>"}, "59490": {"rpg": {"243": "Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 Edition)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Friend & Foe: The Elves and Bugbears of Tellene", "rpgproducer": {"2602": "Brian Jelke"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic777126.jpg", "usersrated": "6", "rpgitemversion": {"14500": "Hardcover Version"}, "rpgsetting": {"533": "Kingdoms of Kalamar"}, "average": "7", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic777126_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Elves and their foes have enthralled readers for ages - now find out why.

Is a musictherapy the right treatment for the vegetarian cat? Show that you have the courage, the right tactics and the necessary pinch of luck to become the chief physician .....<br/><br/>You work as veterinarians in a nutty pet clinic. The animals there are not really ill but<br/>a little strange. The patients cards show how many therapy points are needed to heal the patients. To gather therapy points you have to deal with the strange therapies in the nutty pet clinic.<br/><br/>Every therapy card is worth at least one therapy point. In order to cure your animal patients it requires a lot of therapy cards. Therapy cards are uncovered one after the other and placed in a row. Whoever thinks that enough therapy cards are displayed places his doctor figure below the last uncovered therapy card, since as soon as a second therapy card of the same kind is uncovered, chaos breaks out in the nutty pet clinic, ending this phase of the game immediately. Whoever has placed his doctor figure in time receives one therapy point for every uncovered therapy card up to his doctors figure, the others are left empty-handed.<br/><br/>To gather a larger amount of therapy points, the players have to use the special functions of the clinic rooms on the gameboard. Having gathered enough therapy points the players place their feeding bowls in clinic rooms. With the feeding bowls the players gather more therapy points so that they can cure the stranger patients. <br/>So it's up to the players to seek a career in the nutty pet clinic and reach the upper clinic floors.<br/><br/>Action cards allow special actions and provide surprising events.

His tools are a keen blade and an equally sharp mind, which he uses to strike down foes and lead less refined teammates to everlasting glory.<br/><br/>Depending on the campaign, a Gallant could be...<br/><br/>* A samurai warrior, as well versed in courtly intrigue as lethal swordplay<br/>    * An obsessed swordsman dedicated to slaying his father's killer<br/>    * A cynical chieftain on a mission of political and physical conquest<br/>    * An arrogant noble lashing enemies with a sharp tongue and sharper blade<br/>    * A sworn bodyguard navigating his ward through the dangerous world of &quot;polite&quot; society<br/>    * A righteous gentleman masquerading as a fop by day and a masked vigilante by night<br/><br/>Plus, a new Melee Combat feat chain, detailing the Sword-Circle dueling discipline!&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "59097": {"rpg": {"3069": "Fantasy Craft"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Infernalist", "rpgproducer": {"15423": "Steve Hough"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic775049.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"14202": "PDF Version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3741": "Call to Arms (Fantasy Craft)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic775049_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's description:<br/><br/>&quot;The Call to Arms series brings exciting new classes and other character options to your Fantasy Craft table. This installment presents the Infernalist, a witch or warlock who barters with evil forces for knowledge, love, and conquest. Driven by dark desires to risk his greatest possession - his immortal soul - the Infernalist seeks nothing short of ultimate arcane power.<br/><br/>Depending on your campaign, an Infernalist could be...<br/><br/>* A megalomaniacal wizard whose lust for power knows no moral (or mortal) bounds<br/>    * A sorcerer rescued from certain death at the price of eternal damnation<br/>    * An adept seduced by vile forces beyond his understanding<br/>    * A blood-mage tapping the power of death to fuel vile magic<br/>    * A witch consorting with the Devil to wreak terrible revenge on her enemies<br/>    * A tragic figure accepting a Pyrrhic bargain to save his true love<br/><br/>Plus, new Spellcasting feats that let you convert your fallen enemies' blood into spell points, align and manipulate aligned spells, and revel in the dark supremacy of the Shadow School.<br/><br/>Take Heed! The Infernalist is not for timid players, nor the faint of heart. By taking levels in this class you're bargaining with malevolent forces of incredible power and risking your character's long-term safety and security. Demonic blessings always come with a price - in this case permanent penalties representing your character's gradual slide into oblivion.

Magic-using characters, who have more of a natural inclination towards reading than characters of other classes, will find an abundance of new ways to apply the knowledge set down in their books - and a whole lot of new books to go searching for!<br/><br/>Players of any class who prefer to use their brains as well as their sword arms will find new roles to play and new ways to tackle the challenges they encounter. Strength can see you through a tough battle, health can keep you standing when you are wounded and luck can sometimes get you out of trouble; but knowledge can trump any of these, because knowledge can find ways of applying strength more efficiently, avoiding wounds in the first place and substituting a blind trust in fate with advance planning. You will never look at a library in the same way again.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "59113": {"rpgitemversion": {"14254": "Paperback Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "High Psionics Compilation, Volume 1", "rpgproducer": {"29210": "Sergio da Silva"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic820107.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"861": "Occult (Psionics / Mentalism)"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3722": "High Psionics"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic820107_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's description:<br/><br/>&quot;Containing the first eight of the High Psionics line of supplements, High Psionics Compilation, Volume 1 offers more than 100 pages of new psionic material.

Although it seems to only have been published in 2009, the copyright on the rules is 1985, and the approach of the tennis game (a good serve is always followed by the server going to the net for a volley, for example) dates from that era.<br/><br/>The 'basic' game is a D6 dice game, with no skill involved. The throw for the serve decides whether it is an ace, a fault, or in play resulting in either a groundstroke rally or the server at the net. Subsequent shots in the rally can be winners or faults, change the positions of the players (at the net or baseline) or keep them as is. There are slightly differing shot results for each die roll, depending on the positioning of the players, and what sort of shot is played (passing shot or lob when the opponent is at the net, smash or volley when you are at the net).<br/><br/>The 'advanced' game follows the same format as the dice game, but allows players to have cards that can be used instead of a throw of the dice. The number of these cards is limited, so there is some player judgement as to when best to play them, or roll the die. 3 Cards are given when serving (presumably so the server usually has more cards than the receiver, and thus an advantage) and 1 card for the winner of each game. The cards either are the equivalent of throwing a &quot;6&quot; (e.g. Service ace, passing shot winner, or the &quot;hit glorious and impossible winning shot&quot; (which can be beaten by another one!) ) or introduce another event such as a let or foot fault on the opponent's serve.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>2 D6<br/>2 die shakers<br/>pack of 52 cards <br/>drawstring bag<br/><br/>"}, "59127": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic624746.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"25": {"name": "Richard Borg"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2009", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"12519": "Cyrille Daujean"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1027": {"name": "Days of Wonder"}}, "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic624746_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "From DoW website:<br/><br/>The Sword of Stalingrad expansion features 2 large-scale ready-to-play Overlord Scenarios;  2 standard scenarios; new Summary cards for the previously published Battle Maps and Mediterranean Theater expansion; and, for the first time, additional cards for in-game play - the new Combat Deck specifically designed for urban warfare.<br/><br/>Sword of Stalingrad<br/><br/>Holed up in a Grain Elevator overlooking a strategically vital square, you just watched the South  Railway Station change hands 14 times in the past 6 hours.

Only this player's ducks may be shot at in this round.<br/>b) Bird flu: kills all ducks on the pond at once.<br/>c) Frank-ent-stein (pun in German: Ente = duck): kill three adjacent ducks and bring one of your killed ducks back into play (built from the mortal remains of the former???)<br/>d) Featherbrain: played on another player with a duck in the crosshairs. If that player has a fire card, he has to shoot his own duck.<br/>e) Shot in the dark: Kills the topmost duck on the draw deck.<br/>f) etc.<br/><br/>- There are three duckling cards shuffled together with the other ducks and the water cards. While one of them crosses the pond, no shooting is allowed (no violence in front of minors).

Different!<br/><br/>The MEGA Role-Playing System is the first RPG of a new generation. The Norwegian inventors have provided a set of rules which contain all of the qualities most desirable to GMs and players.<br/><br/>The qualities are:<br/><br/>Playability: The system developed due to disatisfaction with those games already available. Extensive play testing and continual improvement has made it a highly playable game. The rules have been designed to reflect real life making it simple to play.<br/><br/>Realism: There are no artificial limits placed upon the abilities and skills of the character. Extensive equipment lists and realistic prices enable the character to be well equipped. There is also enough background information on things such as weather, religion and NPCs to allow the creation of a realistic campaign world.<br/><br/>Combat: Although not designed for the &quot;hack-kill-slay-brigade&quot;, the combat system will allow any fights to be resolved quickly and easily. Combat is highly realistic without being too complex.<br/><br/>Also it is:<br/><br/>Easy to learn for the GM: The same principles have been used for attributes, skills, combat and magic. Therefore familiarity with the character creation and improvement is rapid. Most of the vital information has been compiled in easy to read tables making it very accessible.<br/><br/>Easy to learn for the players: Only minimal knowledge of the rules is required to create and run characters therefore they can enjoy playing the game.<br/><br/>Complete: All necessary information for running a game is contained in this volume.<br/><br/>Interesting: The good character generation system gives abilities according to previous experience. This means that a new character is unlikely to be unsuitable for adventuring. Furthermore, the players can play any creature (usually intelligent) within the GM's campaign world.<br/><br/>Flexible: The rules are flexible enough that any real-life situation can be catered for by the GM. They can also readily accomodate new skills, weapons, magic and spells, etc. The system is well suited for running an already existing campaign as it is easy to adapt. It is easy to change weapons, skills, spells or creatures without destroying the game balance.<br/><br/>Fun: All of the above leads to the basic requirement of all games - IT IS FUN TO PLAY.<br/><br/>"}, "59185": {"rpg": {"1395": "The MEGA Role-Playing System"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Ogre Forest", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic580597.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"14286": "Softcover version"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic580597_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>From the back of the book<br/><br/>This module is designed to give starting adventures for inexperienced characters, players and GMs. It contains two adventures, Ogre Forest and The Return of Twain Alderyn in addition to five special encounters.
