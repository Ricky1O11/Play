In this scenario, a group of adolescents are sequestered at a retreat guided by the Gardener, a fully adult Symbiote, who facilitates their development through structured exercises. Each adolescent starts with one Parasitic and one Symbiotic trait.

Clark.

Groups that span exactly as many rows as columns are owned by the opponent of the player who most recently placed a stone on the board.<br/><br/>To claim a group is to place a marker of yours on top of one of its stones.<br/><br/>A group is finished if its vertical and horizontal dimensions can't grow larger by means of any series of placements on empty points.<br/><br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>Vertical plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must either pass or place one stone of any color on an empty point. After a placement, every unclaimed finished group is claimed by its current owner.<br/><br/>The game ends when both players pass consecutively. A player's score is the total number of stones on the board in groups that they have claimed, plus a komi in the case of Horizontal. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/><br/>Komi<br/><br/>The komi is the number of points which is added to Horizontal's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides.

This product comes to remedy this issue.<br/><br/>This product provides a full Sol-centered, hexagon-based star-map, 20 parsecs by 16 parsecs in size - a &quot;Quadrant&quot; if you will. Additionally, it provides full Cepheus Engine (and 2d6 sci-fi SRD) data for the &quot;main world&quot; planets of each and every star involved, ready for you, the Referee, to colonize.<br/>For your convenience, we also provide expanded Temperature rules for the included worlds, fully compatible with the Cepheus Engine rules, as well as a short overview of star spectral types.<br/><br/>We based these maps on real, up-to-date astronomical data, which we have abstracted into a two-dimensional hexagon grid where each hexagon is one parsec in width. We tried to make sure that the system data suits the data we have now &ndash; as of the summer of 2016 &ndash; about our stellar neighborhood, though abstracted, as noted above, for gaming use.<br/><br/>All maps, UWPs, and rule data in this product are fully open-content, as per the OGL.

The game rules are freely distributed for anyone to share. While designed for 2 to 4 players, it can be played with more as long as there are enough blocks available. After three rounds of building and fighting with rival castles the winner is the player with the largest and greatest castle with the highest towers.<br/><br/>During building a random card determines the block every player gets to place next to their castle. There's a push your luck mechanic in that the players should complete the castle before a dice roll ends the building phase after 8 to 13 cards.<br/><br/>The fighting is asymmetric so that the defender is basically choosing which attackers to target and tries to score high enough dice throws, while the attacker is able to choose where he moves his troops and if he wants to try to conquer the castle to get a block for himself or simply wreck parts of the defender's castle. Conquering is achieved by reaching a flag inside the castle.<br/><br/>Actual victory points are calculated after the third battle by adding the squared height of the towers to the castle area.<br/><br/>"}, "211237": {"rpgdesigner": ["Eric Brunsell"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Weeping Glass", "rpgartist": ["Patrick Pullen"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3220921.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": ["Forgotten Realms"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3220921_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>A little lore, a lot of gore...<br/><br/>In The Weeping Glass, the characters happen to be in the wrong inn at the wrong time.

Students in the classroom create characters that are scientists.  Focus should be given to developing character backgrounds that are not stereotypical and character interests that are broad and divergent.  Character creation is presented as a solitaire assignment prior to the roleplaying sessions.<br/><br/>During play, students are encouraged to use costuming.  Play sessions use the fictional setting of Gopher Tortoise Elementary School.  During the live-action play sessions, the instructor assumes the role of scientific facilitator and leads a series of seminar discussions.  The introductory scene is presented as The Oprah Show and involves an extemporized concise interview of participants.  Later scenes involve direct interaction and spontaneous discussions among players.  The concluding scene involves a group presentation to the assembled faculty of Gopher Tortoise Elementary School where the faculty is instructed in the nature of science and the scientific process.<br/><br/>"}, "211240": {"poll": [], "name": "Tiny Epic Western: The Tycoon", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Set Collection", "Variable Player Powers", "Worker Placement"], "yearpublished": "2016", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "18", "boardgamefamily": ["Poker", "Tiny Epic"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3248858_t.jpg", "average": "6.91667", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Gamelyn Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3248858.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["English first Edition"], "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["American West", "Bluffing", "Expansion for Base-game", "Industry / Manufacturing"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "New boss card<br/><br/>Text reads:<br/>At the end of phase four gain XX if you did not buy a building card at any point in the round.<br/><br/>&quot;Rough times at the table?

Our concept of what&rsquo;s acceptable in fantasy has moved on from the medieval period more into the renaissance and restoration eras. That means firearms, which have often been eschewed in traditional fantasy for one reason or another, but in many ways firearms make a great deal of sense. Magic has already affected the changes that firearms did in the real world, reducing the effectiveness of armour and fortification, allowing ships to project force at great distance &ndash; even from off shore.<br/><br/>Like crossbows supplanting longbows, firearms democratised firepower. They didn&rsquo;t require a huge amount of skill &ndash; despite being more technical and fiddly in many ways &ndash; and a man could be armed and fire en masse with other to devastating effect very swiftly.<br/><br/>Besides, guns are just fucking cool.

Attacks can destroy some parts of player tower, block his queue, steal construction (wooden elements from tower) and more.<br/>Winner is player who will build highest tower when there are no wooden bricks (construction) to summon from Source.<br/>During game, tactic is very important, as well as hand management. But game has two modes, for younger and older players:<br/>Basic - for younger players. It's rather building race then real fight. Basic mode will let you learn about game mechanics and summoning Construction (wooden bricks)<br/><br/>Advanced - it's where real magic starts. In this mode players use Special Cards, which contains additional attacks (3 per card). And those spells are much more powerful then basic attacks (from Attack Chart). Also, its easier to get cards to attack, named Elements. There are 4 elements in game: Fire, Wind, Earth and Water.<br/>While your tower is getting bigger, you need to focus to prevent lower sections from being destroyed. For this, you use Section. You can summon Section each 5 levels of tower, and when you have 8 or 6 (depends on game type) constructions in your storage.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s in the box:<br/>- 126 wooden bricks (0,6x06x2,3 inch)<br/>- 20 Summoning Cards<br/>- 24 Elements Cards<br/>- 11 Special Cards<br/>- 12 Securing Sections<br/>- Attack Chart<br/>- Instruction<br/><br/>What is for what?<br/><br/>Wooden bricks allow players to build towers. Each floor of tower consists from 2 bricks. Those bricks are named &ldquo;construction&rdquo;, and can be removed by other player when he uses hostile action (attack) on yours tower<br/><br/>Securing Section building this prevents lower parts of tower from most attacks, however there are some strong spells that can remove it and even construction below!<br/>Summoning cards allows to summon construction elements from &ldquo;source&rdquo;. Summoned construction can be used for building tower or placed in Storage (near tower). Bricks in storage can be traded for Attack Card or Section.<br/><br/>Elements Cards are used mostly to assembly spells, like attacks, area attacks, stealing, blocking move, forcing other player to make bad move, ect.<br/>Special Cards are used in Advanced game. They add 33 actions to the game. Spells and attacks are much stronger. Also, these cards adds some defensive abilities.<br/><br/>"}, "211486": {"statistics": [], "name": "Nintendo Switch", "usersrated": "2", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3450460.png", "videogamehwversion": ["First edition"], "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Console"], "average": "7.5", "videogamehardware": ["Nintendo Switch"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3450460_t.png", "videogamehwmfg": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "description": "In addition to providing single and multiplayer thrills at home, the Nintendo Switch system also enables gamers to play the same title wherever, whenever and with whomever they choose.

That is, until the Environmental Protection Agency suddenly showed up in nearby Denver. A horrible mine accident occurred near the city when careless E.P.A. workers mistakenly released thousands of gallons of Widgetanium (a strange experimental chemical that was being tested by the U.S. government) into the city&rsquo;s water system. By the next day, the contamination was widespread and infected residents were slowly turned into some kind of zombie-like monsters. There were even rumors of the recently-deceased being re-animated from the city&rsquo;s morgue! These &ldquo;living corpses&rdquo; soon took over the city and infected thousands of others as well. Slowly expanding out from the Denver city limits, the &ldquo;Day of Reckoning&rdquo; was finally upon the citizens of Denney Springs. At first, they were horrified and completely overwhelmed, losing hundreds of their fellow citizens. But the tough community eventually organized, gathered its resolve and fought back courageously. The majority of townsfolk were herded out in refugee columns and headed for the protection of the mountains. A series of distress calls were sent out, begging for help from the Colorado National Guard. A plan was arranged for full evacuation from a quickly-constructed Guard base in nearby Wagon Gap, on the other side of the mountain range. This was a welcome and hopeful plan, but getting everyone there safely was another matter entirely &hellip;..<br/><br/>Dead Reckoning is a light, fast-playing zombie-themed wargame that features a new, streamlined system which allows both players to be constantly involved in the game play, provides challenging decision making and yet easily resolves all combats with the simple drawing of cards. There are no complicated combat results tables, no dice rolling, no factor counting, no lists of modifiers and almost no math calculations.

A roleplaying game is a game in which players, using their imaginations, take on the roles of fictional characters within a story. The story unfolds by way of a Game Master who acts as a storyteller. The players control how their characters react to the events of the story as described by the Game Master. Dice are used to add elements of chance so no one knows exactly what is going to happen.<br/><br/>If you are not familiar with the concept of roleplaying, then this game may not be for you. Dice Chucker is aimed at experienced players who are looking for something new, fun, and different. I find that many players have become disillusioned with the modern gaming industry, and are seeking alternative gaming systems<br/><br/>So what makes Dice Chucker so unique?
