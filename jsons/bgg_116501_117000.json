The assumption of the game is that the pirates, in league with local warlords and Al Qaeda, have become strong enough to be an even bigger threat to the region than they are now. In response, various powers launch military action against them.<br/> There are two players in Somali Pirates: The Coalition, who wants to destroy the pirates, and the Pirates, who want to survive, as well as to maximize their own power and wealth. Central to play of the game is the Netwar Index. Each player has a Netwar Index that indicates how successful he is in achieving his goals...effectively, representing the amount of public support that each side is getting. The Netwar Index affects various aspects of the game, such as mobilization of reinforcements, and is also part of gaining victory.<br/> Both players have a set of counters that represent their naval, land, air and special operations forces (SOF). Players move their pieces across the spaces on the map and engage in various kinds of conflict in order to destroy enemy forces, seize critical geographical regions, and change the Netwar Index (hopefully in their favor). Both sides can mobilize new units by paying for them with Netwar Points. Given the asymmetry of the situation, each side in the game will have several unique rules..<br/> The game includes one map of East Africa and environs, from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, and one counter-sheet (228 counters) representing various pirate and Al Qaeda forces, local militias and warlords, plus the principle Coalition forces (primarily NATO and the United States, and even a potential inclusion of a Chinese expeditionary force).<br/> The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) and 176 counters.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"145215": "First edition"}, "age": "0", "name": "Somali Pirates", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "6.97308", "usersrated": "26", "boardgamefamily": {"20084": "Magazine: Modern War"}}, "116737": {"boardgamedesigner": {"337": {"name": "Joseph Miranda"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Six Day War: 1967", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "29", "boardgamefamily": {"20084": "Magazine: Modern War"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1531389_t.jpg", "average": "6.80345", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"102": {"name": "Decision Games (I)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1531389.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"145216": "Modern War Magazine edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1069": {"name": "Modern Warfare"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Six Day War: 1967, designed by Joseph Miranda, is a wargame of Arab-Israeli War of June 1967. There are two players in the game, each commanding a Front of the Israeli Army against various Arab opponents. One commands the Sinai Front; the second commands the Eastern Front. Each player also commands the Arab forces facing the other player (his opponent.) The game is designed in this manner owing to the massive qualitative superiority of Israeli forces in this war. The assumption of the game is that an Israeli victory was generally inevitable, so the intent is to place the players in a situation in which they have to compete with each other on both sides to win the greatest possible victory on their own Front.<br/> The map is divided into two sectors, one for each Front. Only units of that Front may operate in that sector. There are additional units, called Reserves, which can possibly be assigned to either Front. The objective of each player is to score the most Victory Points in terms of seizing objectives and destroying enemy units at the lowest possible cost. Meanwhile, the player will be using the Arab forces facing the other player to delay or even stop that Front.<br/> The game includes one map of Israel and the surrounding regions from the Golan Heights to the Suez canal (and all of the Sinai), and one counter-sheet (228 counters) representing all of the Israeli and Arab forces, color-coded to apportion them by their respect Front.<br/> The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) and 228 counters.<br/><br/>"}, "116738": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1747": {"name": "Ty Bomba"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Drive on Pyongyang", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "20", "boardgamefamily": {"20084": "Magazine: Modern War"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1250908_t.jpg", "average": "5.65", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"102": {"name": "Decision Games (I)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1250908.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"145217": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1069": {"name": "Modern Warfare"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Drive on Pyongyang, designed by Ty Bomba, is an updated &quot;what-if&quot; simulation of the fighting that might occur on the Korean peninsula if the US-led anti-terrorism Coalition launches a ground war to finally settle with the Pyongyang regime.<br/> The game is a two-player wargame of low-to-intermediate complexity that postulates this might-be war lasting about a month.

Historically, the quick US-Coalition victory over Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s military forces in March of that year quickly degenerated into an insurgency that swept the country. The situation was eventually turned around, but only after a steep learning curve for the United States and its partners. The game shows some of the major factors involved. <br/> There are two players in the game: The Insurgents (who want to seize control of Iraq. These represent various Iraqi Rebels and Foreign Fighters, the latter including Al Qaeda and Iranian support, among others), and the Counterinsurgents (who want to restore stability to a democratic Iraq, as well as defeat any Al Qaeda elements which may be operating in the country.) These represent Multinational (MNF) forces (US and allies) and Iraqi Government Forces (which also include friendly Iraqi tribal militias).<br/> Both players have a set of pieces that represent conventional and unconventional forces. During their respective turns, players move their pieces amongst the spaces on the map, and engage in various kinds of conflict in order to destroy enemy forces.

To add to this, each individual unit can gain experience and level up, much like an RPG, and this will give units increased accuracy, defense, and other bonuses.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisenryaku_Perfect_HD,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisenryaku_Perfect_HD,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "116756": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Demonicon", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"193096": "English/European Windows edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2494029.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "average": "5.375", "videogamefranchise": {"6803": "The Dark Eye"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "usersrated": "4", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2494029_t.jpg", "description": "The Dark Eye: Demonicon is an upcomming fanstasy game that will feature an original ruleset and game world of The Dark Eye series.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Eye' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Eye</a>:_Demonicon,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "116758": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dead or Alive 5", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"185939": "English/European PlayStation 3 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2440645.jpg", "videogameseries": {"35142": "Dead or Alive"}, "videogametheme": {"2493": "Martial Arts"}, "videogamegenre": {"2159": "Fighting"}, "videogamecharacter": {"42096": "Hitomi"}, "usersrated": "7", "average": "7.46429", "videogamefranchise": {"4837": "Dead or Alive"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "videogamehonor": {"31935": "2012 Game Critics Best Fighting Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"357591": "Hitomi"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2440645_t.jpg", "description": "Dead or Alive 5 is the first console installment of the series that will be developed without the input of series creator Tomonobu Itagaki.

The goal of the game is to have the most points, points are scored each turn where a player lays a tile that matches more than one individual tile segment already on the tableau.<br/><br/>A game is played over a series of seven hands, with each hand&rsquo;s tableau building upon a double. The first hand starts with the double six, and successive hands continue on down to double blank.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each hand, thoroughly shuffle the tiles face-down. Each player then draws seven tiles. The player having the double corresponding to the current hand leads it face-up to the center of the table, oriented horizontally from his point of view. Thereafter, each player, in turn, places one tile from his hand onto the table, face-up and oriented horizontally from his point of view, such that at least one segment of the played tile matches at least one tile segment that is already part of the tableau. The tableau usually takes on an irregular, blob-like shape and need not remain closepacked; unusual shapes and enclosed empty spaces of any size are both acceptable. Not all segments need to match, but the more that do, the more points the play is worth. One matched segment (the most common play) scores nothing. Two matched segments score one point for the partnership that played it. Three matched segments score five points. Four or more matched segments score ten points. Points are recorded as they are made during play.<br/><br/>(from the rules found on pagat.com)<br/><br/>"}, "116787": {"boardgamedesigner": {"182": {"name": "Peter Schurzmann"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Das \u00dc-40 Partyspiel", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2073": "Acting"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"18187": "Das \u00dc Party- and Quizgames"}, "maxplayers": "12", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1194971_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"39": {"name": "Pegasus Spiele"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1194971.png", "boardgameversion": {"145389": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Objective:<br/>be the first climbing up the board to the top by knowing the correct answers &amp; describing the challenges confronted with (data out of the 80's)<br/> - acting by turn -<br/>A quiz game for people who just turned 40 and want to test their knowledge about trendy things from those times.<br/><br/>Can you remember 'Schwarzwaldklinik', Rubik's Cube,...? <br/>You must explain or guess these 'terms', sometimes in a creative way! <br/>Whoever's guess is correct advances on the scoring board faster than other players.<br/>More fun is achieved by reaching marked/coloured fields on the board; allowed ways of explaining are significantly reduced;<br/><br/>"}, "116788": {"boardgamedesigner": {"56872": {"name": "Murielle Neveux"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Prot\u00e9geons la plan\u00e8te", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1438053_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"21417": {"name": "Gr\u00fcnd"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1438053.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"145390": "Gr\u00fcnd Edition 2010"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Book and trivia game for protecting our Planet.<br/><br/>There are 250 cards with trivia questions rather easy, affordable at eight years.

His first maneuver starts out well&mdash;with the French poised to slip into Smolensk behind the Russians. However, the opportunity to bring an end to the campaign will remain unfulfilled. After that, Moscow became the default destination of the Grande Arm&eacute;e. As Napoleon stated, &ldquo;The wine has been poured and must now be drunk.&quot;<br/><br/>Napoleon against Russia is one of the games from OSG's THE LIBRARY OF NAPOLEONIC BATTLES series. Details on the series are below, as all the games share a common rules set and game system.<br/><br/>BATTLES SIMULATED:<br/><br/>     Smolensk, A Battle Postponed, 16-17 August<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>When he recognized that the enemy had withdrawn into the city, the Emperor&rsquo;s plan was stymied. He either had to seize Smolensk on the 16th, without waiting for the arrival of the entire army, or cross the Dneiper River east of Smolensk. Instead he waited for the Russians to make a mistake, and gave them time to pull out along the Moscow road.<br/><br/><br/>     Valutino, Rearguard Action, 18 August<br/><br/><br/>When the Russians did give him an opportunity to catch the First Army disunited after a confused night march, Napoleon had already returned to Smolensk, expecting nothing more than a rearguard action. Hence he was not on the scene to coordinate the actions of his Marshals, who, left to themselves, were unable to crystallize a victory out of the opportunity.<br/><br/><br/>     Shevardino, Fight for the Redoubt, 5-6 September <br/><br/><br/>The preliminary battle opened with the arrival of the French cavalry who immediate attacked Konovnytsyn. On the 6th, more French forces arrived including the IV Corps and the Polish Corps. The French captured the Shevardino redoubt at a cost of 4,000&ndash;5,000 French and 6,000 Russian casualties.<br/><br/><br/>     Borodino, The Russian Army is Saved, 7-8 September <br/><br/><br/>In the climactic battle, Napoleon has been criticized for making a simple frontal assault. With our large map the French player will have plenty of maneuver room to try and outflank the Russian army to the south, or even to the north. He will also have the option of attacking the north flank as Kutusov expected.<br/><br/><br/>     Maloyaroslavets, The Retreat Goes Awry, 23-24 October<br/><br/><br/>Trying to secure a bridge over the Luzha River, the Italians of Eugene's IV Corps lost about 5,000 and the Russians about 6,000 men as the town changed hands eight times. Except for Davout, all the French marshals advocated a return to the main highway to Smolensk, through the depleted zone, a detour that doomed the Army.<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION<br/>The Library of Napoleonic Battles - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) Series: <br/><br/>     480 meters per hex, <br/>     1 hour per turn, <br/>     400-800 men per strength point. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Each Approach to Battle game lasts about 22 turns.

It was released during the 2011 Christmas season and displayed along with other Mattel dice games in the same type of soda can tin packaging.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>The game includes 12 dice, three in each of four colors, and 17 mission cards. Each three-die set of set of dice includes a normal six-sided die, a six-sided die with the 2 replaced by a Skip-Bo wild logo, and a six-sided die with the 4 replaced by a Skip-Bo wild logo. The 17 mission cards include three-number sequences (i.e., 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, 4-5-6, 1-3-5, 2-4-6) or descriptions of three-number sets (i.e., all dice same, all dice even, all dice odd).<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>Each player takes a three-dice set and one of the mission cards is revealed. All players roll their dice attempting to roll the sequence or set shown on the revealed mission card. Rolled dice that match a portion of the mission card can be saved aside when the remaining dice are rerolled. A player may use one Skip-Bo wild logo to represent a needed die on the mission card. When a player's rolled dice match the sequence or set shown on the mission card, he or she calls out, &quot;Skip-Bo!&quot; and collects the mission card. Another mission card is revealed and play continues until one player has collected five mission cards, winning the game.<br/><br/>PACKAGING:<br/>This edition was packaged in a creative looking tin that was made to resemble an aluminum soda can--complete with Nutrition Facts label. The top of the can pops off (twist to open). The one sheet of rules, 12 dice, and deck of 17 mission cards fit inside the tin with a cardboard insert to help dampen the sound of the dice in the tin. The tin also has a coin slot in the top that serves no purpose for the Skip-Bo Dice Game.<br/><br/>"}, "116822": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Car Wars Internet Newsletter (Vol 4 No 9 - September 2051)", "rpgproducer": {"54127": "Michael Owen"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1292253.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"16903": "Car Wars Internet Newsletter"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"75709": "2050-2051 AADA WORLD DUELING CHAMPIONSHIPS"}, "rpg": {"3872": "Car Wars"}, "rpgissueversion": {"145479": "Email Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1292253_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In this article: THE GUNNERY CHAIR, 2050-2051 AADA WORLD DUELING CHAMPIONSHIPS, THE CRACKED WINDSHIELD, THE DAEMON MECHANIC, THE FIRING RANGE, NANS TICKER, &amp; WEB WATCH.<br/><br/>"}, "116823": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1735569.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"56885": {"name": "Bryan \"Kaiser\" Tillman"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": {"56885": "Bryan \"Kaiser\" Tillman"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"21426": {"name": "Kaiser Studio Productions"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1735569_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "Welcome to world of Dark Legacy.

With the unique and various weapons, armor and relics, that a player can equip themselves with, players can become whomever they imagine themselves to be.<br/><br/>In Dark Legacy, it is the players objective to destroy their opponents and their armies, by building a deck of magic spells that no one can withstand, rolling the d20 in their favor and strategically summoning their army to be the strongest. Just like in real battle you will have to anticipate the probability of the unexpected. Don't make choices too hastily for they may be the demise of your army and yourself.<br/><br/>Dark Legacy is a game that can be played one-on-one or in team battle.<br/><br/>Here are the type of cards that can be played in Dark Legacy:<br/><br/>     Enhancement cards are for summoned creatures, weapons and the Hero. These cards can either strengthen or weaken that which it is place upon.<br/>     Creature cards are just that. They are the faction specific cards that each one of the six different factions use to strengthen their army to win the battle.<br/>     Magic cards are the spell cards used to tip the balance in battle. There are faction specific magic cards and general magic cards.<br/>     Armor cards are only for the Heroes in battle. This gives each Hero extra defense points on top of their life points.<br/>     Weapon cards are only for the Heroes in battle. There is a wide variety of weapon cards and as the Hero levels up there are stronger and more magical weapons that become available to them.<br/>     Relic cards are ancient cards with abilities that are available to every player if you find them. There are relics that will fit every players style of fighting.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Evolution System for Battle<br/><br/>     Before the battle begins, players must decide who is going first.<br/>     At the beginning of every battle each player draws five cards.<br/>     Each player is now allowed to place one card on the equip side of the mat. This card has to cost 0 and the player has to have the correct skill level to put that card down.<br/>     There is no damage permitted for the first round in battle, meaning that no one can attack or cast spells that deal damage until it is the first person&rsquo;s turn again.<br/>     The player that is going first must begin the battle by drawing a card. (At the beginning of every turn players will draw a card.)<br/>     In order to cast any of the player&rsquo;s cards they must roll the d20. There is only one roll per turn, unless there is a card in play that allows for another roll. The number that you roll will be the<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>number of casting points you have to cast cards from your hand.<br/><br/>     In order to cast spells you have to have a high enough SKILL LEVEL (SL) and have enough CASTING POINTS (CP).<br/>     The player can then cast any number of cards as long as they have the proper SL and CP.<br/>     If the opponent has the ability to counter the spell they can do so after the card is cast.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Now the second round begins.  At the beginning of the player&rsquo;s turn they must draw a card and then decide weather to attack or cast and use the cards abilities to help you win the battle.<br/><br/>Charging Field<br/><br/>     Players may put any card, within their faction or subsection, on this field face down. This card is now charging. This field is to be used for cards that are above of your skill level. <br/>     You may place cards that are in your skill range, but that would defeat the purpose of charging the card. In order to cast the card that you put on the charging field, it must charge for the difference of your skill level and the skill level required to cast<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"145481": "English first edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Dark Legacy", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "average": "6.66667", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "116824": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Car Wars Internet Newsletter (Vol 4 No 10 - October 2051)", "rpgproducer": {"54127": "Michael Owen"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1292256.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"16903": "Car Wars Internet Newsletter"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"75897": "NANS TICKER"}, "rpg": {"3872": "Car Wars"}, "rpgissueversion": {"145482": "Email Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1292256_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In this issue: THE GUNNERY CHAIR, NANS TICKER, &amp; WEB WATCH.<br/><br/>"}, "116825": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Car Wars Internet Newsletter (Vol 4 No 11 - November 2051)", "rpgproducer": {"54127": "Michael Owen"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1292259.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"16903": "Car Wars Internet Newsletter"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"78415": "NANS TICKER"}, "rpg": {"3872": "Car Wars"}, "rpgissueversion": {"145484": "Email Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1292259_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In this issue: THE GUNNERY CHAIR, THE DAEMON MECHANIC, NANS TICKER, WADA NEWS, &amp; WEB WATCH.<br/><br/>"}, "116826": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 1)", "rpgproducer": {"18784": "Johnn Four"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2006413.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"17034": "Roleplaying Tips"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"91595": "Mapping Dilemma: How to Stop Your Players from Yawning"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"308128": "Text Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2006413_t.png", "description": "Article Title:<br/><br/>Mapping Dilemma: How To Stop Your Players From Yawning<br/><br/>"}, "116827": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Roleplaying Tips (Issue 2)", "rpgproducer": {"18784": "Johnn Four"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2006414.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"17034": "Roleplaying Tips"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"91596": "The Time Bomb Solution"}, "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgissueversion": {"145487": "Electronic Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2006414_t.png", "description": "Article Title:<br/><br/>The Time Bomb Solution<br/><br/>"}, "116829": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1308713.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"42725": {"name": "Nikolas Sakaloglou"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"16755": {"name": "Artipia Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1308713_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "description": "These were exclusive promos offered to those who supported Briefcase on its funding campaign on indiegogo from 11-02-2012 to 11-03-2012.<br/><br/>The exclusive promos included the following Company Card Sets:<br/><br/>Model Agency (3 Company cards + 1 Randomizer card)<br/>Shipyard (3 Company cards + 1 Randomizer card)<br/>Football Club (3 Company cards + 1 Randomizer card)<br/>Dot Com (3 Company cards + 1 Randomizer card)<br/>Multiplex (3 Company cards + 1 Randomizer card)<br/>Casino (3 Company cards + 1 Randomizer card + 3 1cm Dice)<br/>Beauty Clinic (3 Company cards + 1 Randomizer card)<br/>Leasing Company (4 Company Cards + 1 Randomizer card)<br/><br/>These Company cards enrich the variety and add more options to the basic game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"145491": "First edition"}, "average": "6.69423", "name": "Briefcase: Bonus Companies", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2664": "Deck / Pool Building"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "52", "expands": {"88016": {"name": "Briefcase"}}, "boardgamefamily": {"16972": "Crowdfunding: Indiegogo"}}, "116830": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Spielwelt (Issue 35 - Oct 1988)", "rpgproducer": {"7604": "Ludger Fischer"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1200088.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"7001": "Spielwelt"}, "rpg": {"16784": "Midgard (3rd Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"145492": "Softcover"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1200088_t.jpg", "description": "This issue contains an overview of new DSA adventures.

Whilst most people who have flown, whether for business or pleasure, appreciate that the aircraft in which they have travelled has been &quot;controlled&quot; in some way, few actually realise the complexity of the system which ensures their safety. And of those who do know what the initials ATC stand for, not many appreciate that most of the work involves controlling aeroplanes as they fly between airports, not just as they approach places such as Heathrow and Gatwick.<br/><br/>The main aim of Air Traffic Control is to ensure a safe and expeditious flow of air-traffic; safe in that all aircraft must be kept apart, and expeditious so as to avoid undue delay. To facilitate this, airways, so-called &quot;motorways in the sky&quot;, have been established linking the major airports of the world. lt is within these airways, and the Terminal Areas which surrounded the airports themselves, that most of the air traffic now flies, safely controlled by ATC.<br/><br/>It is the aim of this program then to simulate this Area Control of Air Traffic. The actual area used is the Hurn sector of the London Air Traffic Control Centre, centred roughly on the Bournemouth/Southampton area - encompassing most of the air traffic from the south and midlands of England going to and from Spain, Portugal, parts of France, Africa and the United States.<br/><br/>You must climb and descend the aircraft according to the rules set out in this booklet, guiding them through your airspace so that when they leave they are going in the right direction, at the correct height, and safely separated from each other.<br/><br/>"}, "116832": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Spielwelt (Issue 34 - Jun 1988)", "rpgproducer": {"7604": "Ludger Fischer"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1200087.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"7001": "Spielwelt"}, "rpg": {"355": "James Bond 007"}, "rpgissueversion": {"145507": "Softcover"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1200087_t.jpg", "description": "This issue contains an article about the James Bond 007 RPG.

Konami issued an in-game thank you to the fans of Dance Dance Revolution and announced that they were starting the series over but did not go into details.

You can unlock characters to play the nonstop mode.<br/><br/>Dance Dance Revolution Extreme uses two new difficulty levels in addition to Light, Standard, and Heavy. Beginners mode, which has been in previous releases of Dance Dance Revolution under the name of Simple and is also featured in Dancing Stage EuroMix 2 as Beginner, is an easier setting than Light and represented by the color light blue. The background animations are replaced with an on-screen dancer that follows the actual step patterns of the song, cueing the player when and where to step with visual aids. Players will also be given a brief tutorial on how to play Dance Dance Revolution after selecting their first stage. By default, Beginner will automatically pass players on their first stage regardless of accuracy and subsequent stages will play to end of the song despite failure. Players can exit or enter Beginners mode any time during stage selection.<br/><br/>The Challenge difficulty level is above Heavy, although the complexity of Challenge step patterns is not always more difficult. Challenge cannot be selected at the start of the game, instead players must enter the Challenge difficulty during stage selection and is represented by the color navy blue. Unlike the other difficulty levels, relatively few songs have a Challenge level. In contrast some songs contain only Challenge step patterns and highlighting them put players on the Challenge difficulty level automatically for those songs. In the arcade release of DDR Extreme there is no visual indication that a song has Challenge step patterns. In the PlayStation 2 release, icons representing each difficulty level including Beginner and Challenge light up when a highlighted song is playable on those levels. During normal gameplay Challenge uses the same rules as every other difficulty level.<br/><br/>In Nonstop and Challenge modes, a new step judgment is used called Marvelous. The judgment uses a stricter timing window than Perfect, representing very accurate steps made by players. Marvelous is displayed after each such step in white, and is not displayed during normal gameplay.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Extreme&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "116846": {"boardgamedesigner": {"56905": {"name": "Christian Boutin"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Slash!", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"56906": "Elise Dubois"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"145531": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1024": {"name": "Horror"}}, "age": "13", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Welcome to the Slash! movie, set in Camp Bloodshed USA, where every teenager is a target and every dark corridor hides terrible danger.

It is the 4th Disney themed DDR game.<br/><br/>As with the other games in the series, the core gameplay involves the player moving his or her feet to a set pattern, stepping in time to the general rhythm or beat of a song. Arrows are divided by 1/4 notes, 1/8 notes, and so on (with differing color schemes for each), up to about 1/32 notes. During normal gameplay, arrows scroll upwards from the bottom of the screen and pass over a set of stationary arrows near the top (referred to as the &quot;guide arrows&quot; or &quot;receptors&quot;, officially known as the Step Zone). When the scrolling arrows overlap the stationary ones, the player must step on the corresponding arrows on the dance platform, and the player is given a judgment for their accuracy (Marvelous, Perfect, Great, Good, Almost (close miss), Boo (complete miss)). Longer green and yellow arrows referred to as &quot;freeze arrows&quot; must be held down for their entire length, either producing a &quot;O.K.&quot; if successful, or a &quot;N.G.&quot; (no good) if not. Dance Dance Revolution X contains songs with Shock Arrows, walls of arrows with lightning effects which must be avoided, which are scored in the same way as Freezes (O.K./N.G.). If they are stepped on, a N.G. is awarded, the lifebar decreases, and the steps become hidden for a short period of time.<br/><br/>While this core gameplay remains mostly the same on this Disney Channel Edition, the songlist consists mostly of songs from Disney Channel programming, including songs from Hannah Montana, The Cheetah Girls, High School Musical, That's So Raven, Kim Possible, The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody.  So, unlike other DDR games, all of the characters selectable on Disney Channel Edition are from the aforementioned shows:<br/><br/>Hannah Montana<br/>    Lilly Truscott<br/>    Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana<br/>High School Musical<br/>    Troy Bolton<br/>    Gabriella Montez<br/>Kim Possible<br/>    Kim Possible<br/>That's So Raven<br/>    Eddie Thomas<br/>That's So Raven/Cory in the House<br/>    Cory Baxter<br/>The Cheetah Girls<br/>    Aquanette<br/>    Chanel<br/>    Dorinda<br/>The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody<br/>    Cody Martin<br/>    Zack Martin<br/>    Maddie Fitzpatrick<br/><br/>Each character has two outfits available, Hannah Montana's secondary costume changes her to her true self, Miley Stewart.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Disney Channel Edition&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "116849": {"boardgamedesigner": {"56907": {"name": "Jean-Baptiste Fremaux"}}, "average": "6.13636", "poll": {}, "name": "Rimtik", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": {"2019": "Partnerships"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "22", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1281941_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"56910": "Nicolas Fumanal"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"21428": {"name": "OldChap Editions"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1281941.png", "boardgameversion": {"145534": "French first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "According to legend, macaws in the tropical forests of South America choose their new leader after ruthless battles of rhymes.

Noah himself stands on one ferry. On a turn, a player plays one card from hand onto the ferry where Noah is located, following two rules: (1) the total weight of all animals on board cannot exceed 21 and (2) animals on a ferry must be placed either in alternating gender order or must be all of the same gender. After placing an animal, the player moves Noah to a different ferry; if he played a female animal, Noah goes to either adjacent ferry, while if he played a male, Noah goes to either ferry on the other side of the circle.<br/><br/>If a player can't legally play an animal, he must first take in hand all the animals on the ferry where Noah is located, then play an animal.<br/><br/>In addition to moving Noah to a nearly full ferry, players have two other ways to benefit themselves or mess with other players. If a player plays an animal of the same species as the one last played on that ferry (regardless of gender), he moves Noah, then takes another turn. If a player brings the weight of a ferry to exactly 21, that ferry launches from shore to meet the ark located in distant waters, a new ferry becomes available for loading, and the player distributes 1&ndash;4 cards from his hand among his opponents. finally, some cards have special animals, such as the giraffe that lets you peek at an opponent's hand and the woodpecker, which stupidly pokes holes in the ferry and reduces its maximum weight to 13. Bad woodpecker, bad!<br/><br/>The round ends when a player runs out of cards in hand or a fourth ferry launches. Players receive penalty points for cards still in hand, scored according to the number of tears on each card, those tears representing Noah's sadness at the animal being left behind. Then players shuffle all the animal cards and begin a new round. The player with the fewest points after three rounds wins!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"188627": "Bombyx multilingual tinbox edition"}, "average": "6.54461", "name": "Noah", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "7", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "857", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"20302": "Noah"}}, "116859": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Zombie Organ", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"145547": "iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1202843.png", "videogametheme": {"2316": "Music"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2163": "Rhythm"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1202843_t.png", "description": "&quot;Combining the exciting elements of a haunted pipe organ with the charm and warmth of the UNDEAD!<br/><br/>FEATURING:<br/>A FULLY ANIMATED 3D ZOMBIE CHOIR<br/><br/>Gasp in amazment as each of our seven unique 3D animated zombies perform just for you!<br/>MULTI-TOUCH PLAYABLE TOMBSTONE ORGAN<br/><br/>Shriek with delight as each tombstone lights up, plays a haunted note, and lets you take control of the zombie bound to it.<br/>AMUSING SPOOKY MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS<br/><br/>Listen if you dare to the zombies beg for &quot;BRAINS&quot; while eerie graveyard sounds immerse you in a fully 3D audio experience&quot;<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "116860": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1661127.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"14650": {"name": "Luis Francisco"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"43899": "Marcelo Bissoli"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"24298": {"name": "FunBox Jogos"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1661127_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1030": {"name": "Party Game"}}, "description": "Welcome to the ultimate cooking contest: The Cook-off!

Unlike those earlier games, however, your goal is to move gemstones from their starting locations on the board to your designated goals, with the player who scores the most points winning the game.<br/><br/>To set up the game board, place the central hex tile, then add five green gems and one indigo gem to it. Place six &quot;U-turn&quot; tiles at their designated locations on the outer edge of the game board, then place a yellow gem on each such tile. Each player places goal markers on goals between these U-turn tiles on the edge of the game board: in a two-player game, the players alternate goals; in a three-player game, each player has one goal to herself, while sharing two others; and in a four-player game, each player shares a goal with every other player.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player places a tile on any space on the game board, with the only restriction being that a player cannot create a route directly from one goal to another. Each tile has three route segments on it, connecting one pair of edges. If a player places a tile next to a gemstone, that gemstone &quot;moves&quot; as far as possible along the route so that all players can see where to place tiles to next move that gemstone. (Thus players avoid the mental gymnastics required in Metro and Linie 1 in which nothing moves until a route is complete.) When connecting to the central tile, the green gems move off first, with the indigo gem moving only with the sixth connection.<br/><br/>If a player places a tile so that one gem would run into another, both gems are removed from the game!<br/><br/>When a gem is moved to a goal owned by only one player, that player keeps the gem. If two players own the goal, then both players collect a gem of that color, taking the extra gem needed from the reserve. Once all the gems have been claimed, the game ends, with players earning 3 points for an indigo gem, 2 for green, and 1 for yellow.

DDR Festival is the first version of Dance Dance Revolution in Japan to primarily use Japanese for in-game text and menus, all DDR games before it simply used American English.<br/><br/>The gameplay remains the same as previous version. The song wheel now uses the same design as the USA version of DDR EXTREME, which means Groove Radar are now gone. As in with the DDR EXTREME USA, the dance play option is missing and is heavily criticized for its strict scoring system. Several other options also strangely missing, such as SOLO (arrow) and challenge difficulty. Instead, the challenge difficulty marquee is replaced by OPTION. The player need to choose OPTION to open the options menu, rather than holding X button after selecting a song. Every songs from DDR Ultramix do not have Beginner difficulty, though some of their heavy charts have been replaced with a new, harder chart. Background of dancer guiding the players how to step also separated from game mode (Beginner difficulty is still selectable though). Party Mode and Mission Mode remains intact, though there are only 50 missions, rather than 100.<br/><br/>The song list primarily consist of American licenses from Karaoke Revolution and new Konami Original introduced in DDR Extreme (USA) as well as new songs from DDR Ultramix (including downloadable songs):<br/>&quot;\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc&quot;     (\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1)<br/>&quot;Diamonds&quot;     (J-POP)<br/>&quot;\u5b66\u5712\u5929\u56fd&quot;     (J-POP)<br/>&quot;\u304a\u3069\u308b\u30dd\u30f3\u30dd\u30b3\u30ea\u30f3&quot;     (\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1)<br/>&quot;Believe&quot;     Eddie.J<br/>&quot;BIZARRE LOVE TRIANGLE&quot;     Jerry<br/>&quot;Kids In America&quot;     KIM WILDE<br/>&quot;LADIES' NIGHT&quot;     &ang;R<br/>&quot;Like A Virgin&quot;     tama_happytone<br/>&quot;Superstar&quot;     Jamelia<br/>&quot;WAITING FOR TONIGHT&quot;     P.A.T.<br/>&quot;.59&quot;     dj TAKA<br/>&quot;5.1.1.&quot;     dj nagureo<br/>&quot;Abyss&quot;     dj TAKA<br/>&quot;BROKEN MY HEART&quot;     NAOKI feat.

As Jake, a character suffering from memory loss, the players job was to try to find out exactly what happened in Eastport, which is now overflowing with zombies.<br/><br/>The game's main claim to fame was the fact that as Jake players could operate one of several vehicles scattered around town. Not only would this provide the player with a means of transportation but it would also serve as armor of sorts. The zombies in Eastport would try to wreck whatever car Jake was driving. Luckily the player could create new vehicles out of parts of previously demolished cars. A female mechanic could also put new parts and items on cars that would be more powerful.<br/><br/>The game would have featured few load times, as after an initial boot up the game would never pause to load data from the disc again.<br/><br/>The game was announced at E3 2004 and set to be released in 2005.

Originally announced with the title &quot;Nina&quot;, its eventual title was chosen as a reference to its multiple-degree fighting system.<br/><br/>Nina Williams, world-renowned assassin, has been hired by the CIA and MI6 to join a team which is attempting to infiltrate &quot;Kometa,&quot; a notorious criminal organization. The team's strategy involves gaining access to the target through a fighting tournament being held on the &quot;Amphitrite,&quot; a luxury cruise ship owned and operated by Kometa. A leaked video on the Internet showed a Kometa ship exploding within the Bermuda Triangle, and it is feared that they are working on some kind of superweapon in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union. Nina's official cover involves infiltration as a competitor in the tournament. However, Nina is also the team's &quot;sweeper&quot;; should her partners fail, she must finish the job. Nina enters the competition, but is quickly discovered and captured. She soon receives a communication informing her of the team's failure and the death of one of the agents named John Doe (killed by Kometa executive Edgar Grant), and that she must now conduct the operation herself. Nina must fight her way through Kometa's forces and expose the truth behind its criminal activities. As she progresses in her mission, Nina fights the Kometa's top executives, starting with the personal bodyguard and lover of Lana Lei, Bryce. She then moves on to photograph a meeting of the directors, with the help of MI6 agent Alan Smithee.<br/><br/>Nina barely escapes the cruise ship with her life, and is taken to a Kometa Island research facility. Here, she encounters Lukas Hayes, a scientist who informs her about Kometa's plan to use satellites to heat and activate methane hydrate on the ocean floor. The result is bubbling which causes ships to lose their buoyancy. The weapon thus has the power to destroy naval vehicles from afar, sinking them to the bottom of the sea. Hayes' plan was to find a new energy source and alternative to fossil fuels, but his research was twisted into a form of warfare. The project is Salacia, the mysterious operation CIA and MI6 have heard rumors of. Nina realizes that she must stop the project, and takes on the second Kometa executive, Enrique Ortega. However, he is joined by Anna Williams (Nina's sister), hired along with the Tekken Force as bodyguards. After briefly engaging in combat with Anna, Nina continues on her mission and manages to kill Enrique. Lukas Hayes, however, is also killed as Lana Lei arrives and recovers a case which houses the electronics to operate Salacia's satellites. With Alan's help, Nina escapes the compound by helicopter, chasing Lana Lei back to the luxury cruise ship.<br/><br/>For a second time, Nina must fight her way through the Kometa boat, only this time against advanced cyborg soldiers, another of Lei's weapons projects. After recovering the keys to her quarters, Nina finds Salacia and engages with Lana. After her defeat, they are interrupted by Alan, who is revealed as Kometa executive Edgar Grant. Shooting Lana, he acknowledges that he is also a sweeper, there to destroy all evidence of his part in the atrocities. Before he can kill Nina, however, Lana shoots him dead, and escapes to a secret room. There, Nina witnesses her powering Salacia, targeting methane hydrate pockets all around the United States coastline. Nina finishes Lana off before she can continue with her insane plan, and makes her way to an escape pod as a self-destruct mode is activated on the boat. Her pod, however, explodes, and Nina lands on the ship's edge. As a rescue helicopter comes for her, she is knocked down by none other than Anna Williams. The two sisters face off as the ship nears destruction, and almost both fall to their deaths. However, the two grudgingly work together to escape and grab the helicopter rope line, with Nina having a flashback to the events prior to her father's death, in particular the moments following when the two sisters comforted one another. Anna drops Nina into the ocean after saying that they are now even. Nina watches on as rescue boats approach from behind her, the Kometa ship exploding and sinking, as Anna leaves on the helicopter.<br/><br/>The game is fully controlled by the analog sticks. The left analog stick is touch-sensitive; through various degrees of holding, tapping or pressing along with other buttons allows Nina to walk, run or evade. The right analog stick is used for offensive moves.<br/><br/>The game's most remarkable feature is the ability to allow Nina to use her martial arts skills to break the bones of her enemies through use of carefully aimed attacks. These attacks do more damage to the enemy and show the player the damage being inflicted on the opponent's skeletal structure. Strangely, this does little to actually disable opponents, as they often continue to use limbs that have been literally shattered, as well as survive blows to the head that would cause the skull to practically explode, without even losing consciousness.<br/><br/>Once the game is completed, &quot;Anna Mode&quot; will be unlocked, offering the player the ability to play as Nina's younger sibling, Anna. Various outfits can be unlocked throughout the game, which include a bikini, cocktail dress, purple jumpsuit, black and silver stealth suit. Playing the game a second time causes LCD crates throughout the game to contain infinite supplies of certain weapons, such as infinite katana and infinite rail-gun. After completing the game twice, the wrestling costume as seen in the opening FMV is also unlocked. A third clear game file additionally unlocks &quot;Tekken 2 Nina&quot;, which instead of an outfit is actually a different facial and bodily construction, exactly as she appears in the Tekken title, in low resolution.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Death by Degrees&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "116967": {"poll": {}, "name": "Smithsonian Artifact or Fiction", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2527047_t.jpg", "average": "5.56667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7638": {"name": "Discovery Bay Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2527047.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"145726": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From Publisher:<br/><br/>Is that Smithsonian fact unbelievably true or outrageously false?

He is a rare powerup known as Summon Phantomon. He randomly appears and stalks a Digimon. If a Digimon touches Phantomon, he'll instantly KO it with his Shadow Scythe.

The Desperated City 2: Frozen Memories?) is a survival game that  follows six characters as they try to escape a city that is being flooded by torrential rains.  The game is a sequel to Disaster Report. A further sequel, Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 3, was released for the PSP on April 23, 2009.<br/><br/>The year is 2010. The underground city, Geo City, is a project put together to design the safest and most advanced city ever built in the world. The newly-opened city is working great and the Mayor's Conference to commemorate the opening is going well, aside from a bit of rain outside. Joshua and Stephanie are just two of the waiters helping make the conference go as smoothly as possible. But, when the nearby Levee breaks and the Hudson River begins to flood the city from above, the building the conference is being held in begins to be pummeled and destroyed by the raging rapids. The city and everyone in it are in total panic and turmoil.<br/><br/>Players must think on their feet and utilize creative survival skills to have any hope of seeing their family again. Body temperature and health decrease when players are wet or in cold weather too long. They must find places to warm themselves and gather food, and find dry clothes or make them. In the end, players must run, climb, jump, and crawl their way out of this devastated city, while constantly trying to piece together information from emergency broadcasts and other victims of the disaster. The choices that the players make within the game affects the main storyline and dialog, and ultimately the ending of the game.<br/><br/>This game is able to interface with the Konami Para Para Paradise controller. This allows the player to design their own hand movements to be used when summoning rescuers. Players may also use the controller to simulate the &quot;fireman carry&quot;, used to move unconscious characters.<br/><br/>Characters<br/><br/>Joshua Harwell is a college student working as a waiter at the Geo City Inaugural Ceremony Banquet when disaster struck.

It is an adventure for one GM and one player &ndash; perhaps a holiday present to one&rsquo;s spouse!  I freely admit the title was originally a cursory misreading of an old TSR book, Manual of the Planes.  However, it has nothing to do with that book.<br/><br/>In fact, this adventure is written with a certain well-known hero in mind.  One whose adventures were first published in 1919 &ndash; hence in a work that is now public domain: The Curse of Capistrano. However, I am not allowed to use the hero&rsquo;s name due to the insanely greed-ridden intellectual property laws of the USA: a parasitic corporation (which did not create the character nor his distinctive look) is willing to take people to court to prevent them from using his name and look without their permission.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I own intellectual property myself and am all for legitimate, valid, justifiable, well-founded, sane readings of the law.  However, the fact that I cannot specify the name of a character in this adventure, even though the author, Johnston McCulley, is long dead and the initial book itself is in the public domain, is obscene.  But enough ranting in a Christmas adventure.<br/><br/>You will have no trouble recognizing the character I am here calling Manuel of the Plains.  He lives in Los Angeles in 1820 and fights oppression, corrupt officials (and, if he had known of them, greedy IP laws), always favoring the poor and downtrodden.  He dresses in black, wears a black mask, is a superb swordfighter, frequently carves his initial on his opponents and their official posters, and his nom de guerre is the Spanish word for &ldquo;fox.&rdquo;  Yes, it&rsquo;s Manuel of the Plains!  You, of course, should substitute the real name every time you see &ldquo;Manuel&rdquo; in this adventure.<br/><br/>"}, "116542": {"rpg": {"1627": "Pathfinder Roleplaying Game"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Beginner Box Pathfinder Society Character Creation Guide", "rpgproducer": {"36215": "Judy Bauer"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1190934.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"144698": "PDF Version"}, "average": "6", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1190934_t.png", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Ready for the next step from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Beginner Box?

The object is to be the first player back to the Clubhouse with the &quot;bag limit&quot; of birds (at least 4 bird pictures with matching description cards).<br/><br/>Starting at the clubhouse, roll the dice and move that number of colored spaces. You may move either way on the board, and you may choose to take an inside path to reach the color space that you want. At each space you collect a card of the matching color: Green for a bird picture, orange for a bird description, or yellow for a situation card which explains a safety tip or legal point. When drawing a situation card, follow the instructions; it may send you to the Dog Training School, Sporting Goods Store, or Skeet Shooting Field! (The tan square has no matching deck, so no card is drawn.)

It was released during the 2011 Christmas season and displayed along with other Mattel dice games in the same type of soda can tin packaging.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>The game includes 11 dice.  Each die is unique and has some combination of faces in the four UNO colors (yellow, green, blue and red).  The die faces include: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, draw one, draw two, and wild (in black).  Note that there are no die faces that represent the Skip or Reverse cards from the original UNO card game (presumably because this is just a 2 player game).<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>The game mechanic is simple and mimics the original UNO card game.  To begin, 5 dice are randomly given to each of the two players.  These dice take the place of a players hand of cards in the original UNO card game.  The 11th die is left in the middle of the play area to form the start of the dice line (think UNO discard stack from the original card game).  The starting player rolls their dice and has to match either the color or value of the most recently placed die in the dice line.  That player's matching die is placed in the dice line and will have to be matched by the next player.  Play continues as players take turns rolling their hand of dice and adding one matching die from their hand to the dice line each turn until they only have one die left in their hand.  The player must then say &quot;UNO!&quot; or be penalized.  The penalty for not remembering to say &quot;UNO!&quot; is similar to the draw one and draw two die faces:  the affected player must take the appropriate number of dice from the end of the dice line.  The first player with no dice left wins.  The winning player's score is based on the faces of the dice left in front of their opponent.  Alternate rules are provided to ignore scoring and simply play the best out of 3 games.<br/><br/>PACKAGING:<br/>This edition was packaged in a creative looking tin that was made to resemble an aluminum soda can--complete with Nutrition Facts label.  The top of the can pops off (twist to open).  The one sheet of rules and 11 dice fit inside the tin with a cardboard insert to help dampen the sound of the dice in the tin.  The tin also has a coin slot in the top that holds the a plastic hook to allow it to be hung for selling/display purposes.<br/><br/>"}, "116594": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Demolition Inc.", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"144831": "PlayStation 3 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1374330.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1374330_t.jpg", "description": "DEMOLITION, INC. is a new action strategy game: Assume the role of the daring demolition worker Mike and start a devastating chain reaction on earth, use cool tools and weapons and expand your destructive powers!<br/><br/>You navigate Mike's UFO over cities of earth and unfold complete chaos with your tools and weapons: Cars which drive into tower blocks and let them collapse, tower blocks which falls onto other tower blocks, exploding cows which let whole streets of houses come tumbling down!<br/><br/>Demolition Inc. is 100% physics technology: nothing is predetermined, and nothing is pre-animated.

In the video game, fruit (and bombs) are tossed into the air and the player makes gestures to slice as much fruit with their sword as possible while avoiding bombs.<br/>The Fruit Ninja Card Game is a very simple push your luck card game that makes thematic use of simply cutting the deck of cards.  By cutting the deck and selecting cards based on the risk associated with the color coded card backs, players attempt to be the first to either collect one of each of the 7 types of fruit or collect 25 pieces of the same type of fruit.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>After shuffling the deck of cards, the starting player cuts the deck while making the sound of someone making a sword chop.  That player chooses either the top card from the bottom section of the deck or the bottom card from the top section of the deck (a choice between the two inner cards of the split deck). By looking at the color of the card backs, the player can asses the risk of choosing a particular card.  Some cards have a higher risk of being a bomb while having the potential to contain more pieces of fruit.  The player continues their turn as long as they avoid choosing a bomb card.  As long as the player only finds fruit cards, they continue adding up fruit and splitting the top section of the deck remaining from their previous split.  If the player chooses to stop, they get to keep their fruit cards and pass the deck to the next player.  If at some point the player chooses to cut the deck and chooses a bomb card, they end their turn and loose any fruit that they have revealed during that turn (while keeping fruit earned on previous turns).  Three types of power bananas can be played from a players saved stash of fruit to perform one of the following actions based on the type of fruit: steal a fruit, ignore a bomb or take an additional turn.  While very simple, this card game remains thematically true to the simple video game that it is based on.<br/><br/>CONTENTS:<br/>103 Fruit Ninja Cards + 1 sheet of rules in English<br/><br/>FROM THE BOX:<br/>Based on the hit game.  Make Sensei proud!  Cut the deck--select the top or the bottom.  The first player to collect one of each fruit or 25 of any fruit wins!  The colors on the card backs will help you choose.  Be wary! Bombs end your turn and you forfeit this turns bounty.

Players can choose to control either the hero, armed with throwing knives, or the heroine, armed with a crossbow. During the game, players will find various relics which permanently increase attack power, defense, or magic power, as well as an arsenal of magic scrolls, and special amulets that create temporary effects. Food can be picked up to heal damage, but occasionally turns out to be poison which hurts the player. Similarly, some scrolls turn out to be a &quot;slow death curse,&quot; which takes a way the player's health continuously until death, unless the exit from that level is found. Enemies in the game include rats, ghosts who can walk through walls, dervishes who can steal a player's possessions, snappers who remain dormant until disturbed, and mad mages, who shoot fireballs. These monsters emerge from special spawning areas called vortexes, which can be destroyed by the player with several shots, except for the rats, who emerge from indestructible sewer grates.<br/><br/>The dungeon consists of many interconnected maze-like levels which rooms, hallways, and doors. There are several multi-level mazes, where the player must ascend and descend between levels several times before finding the correct path. The collecting of keys to open doors is a fundamental part of the game, while fighting against a horde of monsters. Most of the levels entail some sort of puzzle solving, involving clues in the form of scrolls that are picked up along the way. These scrolls also tell the story of an unsuccessful group of adventurers who journeyed through the dungeon before the current players. This ill-fated party included members Arthur, Bloodaxe, Grindlewald, Furrowfoot, and Imelda, as well as Mellack, a mage whom the previous adventurers met along the way.

The upper screen section is called the mission command screen and displays which character is active, the active character's location and the status of all characters: whether they are moving, engaged in combat, weak or dying or performing certain action such as picking locks.

Please note, that this is a game for the gamers - it is not for profit, nor will it ever be. In addition, the rules will literally be shaped by the players - each new edition will contain rule changes and additions that are suggested by YOU. Please feel free to jot down any ideas as you play and submit them to the Drunk Dwarves webmaster.<br/><br/>And without further delay - we present our first published game: AXLE TRIBES.<br/><br/>The Earth has been blighted. Long ago an event, the great end, turned the world as we knew it into a smitten landscape of broken glass and twisted jungles of metal rod. All that was green and blue, has been reborn in hues of dead browns. The air tastes bad - and it's hard to believe we were ever meant to live here.<br/><br/>Between the endless stretches of waste there are monstrous cities ruled by powerful land lords, where the land still clings to life. But if you live there, you live their way - or not at all. That's why many of us band together and try to survive in the wastes of the bad lands - among the mutant freaks and the harsh ever-present sun. The Axle Tribes rule this land, that is - everything left worth ruling. The Axle Tribes fight, they fight over food, water, and the parts needed to make and maintain our steeds. I am a warrior, my steed is my life, and the life of my tribe.<br/><br/>Game Description Notes<br/><br/>This free set of miniatures rules is meant to be played with Hot Wheels (or similar) model cars on the table top. (Serious players often customize their vehicles with weapons, armor-plating, etc.) Both players control a Tribe and each is allowed to build a set amount of vehicles (called Steeds) to fight it out.<br/><br/>Players work within an agreed upon dollar cap to create a variety of vehicles. Various weapons and vehicle upgrades make each Steed more distinctive, but also add to the cost. The game progresses in Turns. (During a Turn each vehicle is activated once.) Vehicles may move, fire, etc. when activated.<br/><br/>Ten-sided dice are used as a randomizer to decide control rolls, to hit rolls, etc. Maneuvers are based on 45 degree turns. There are special rules for collisions. Each steed has its own record sheet where damage is recorded. Printable counters are included to help track damage and speed.<br/><br/>The victory conditions of the game are left up to the players. A total destruction match in which only one side is left standing is the simplest way to play.<br/><br/>"}, "116627": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Master of Monsters: Neo Generations", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"144924": "Japanese Sega Saturn version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1201545.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4439": "SEGA Saturn"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1201545_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Neo Generations is the sequel to the Sega Genesis game Master of Monsters.

Southern Belle was unique at the time of release in that it was the first 3D steam train simulator available for home computers. The game allows the user to take over the fireman and/or driver duties on a King Arthur class passenger steam locomotive on the London to Brighton line. It was programmed by Mike Male, who teamed up friend and railway buff Bob Hillyer.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to complete a simulated journey of the Southern Belle steam passenger train from London Victoria to Brighton while keeping to speed regulations, being careful not to derail when going around curves and completing the journey on time. There are various options available including a demonstration run, where the computer takes control of the locomotive, and a number of challenges such as beating the real record breaking run for that line, set on July 26, 1903 (at 48 minutes 41 seconds).<br/><br/>The graphics were &quot;vector-style&quot;, but because of the limitations of the ZX Spectrum and such computers, the graphics were minimal. The framerate was very slow, updating only once per second. This was particularly notable when playing in &quot;Fast&quot; mode, where you could speed the gameplay up x5 by pressing the &quot;A&quot; key. Also, the main gameplay screen lacked colour, with most versions being in monochrome. However, the ZX Spectrum version did include a &quot;red&quot; fire. Additionally, there were sections of line where there were no buildings visible in the foreground, leading to criticisms that the game looked as though the countryside had been hit by a nuclear bomb.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Southern Belle (video game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "116650": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Evening Star", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"144983": "Amstrad CPC Cassette edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2473": "Commercial / Public Transport"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"5203": "Amstrad CPC"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Evening Star is a vector graphics Train Simulation type game for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron and Amstrad CPC.

The objectives are keeping to the tight timetable, earning points for safety and economy, and obeying signals. Stops are made at stations along your route to pick up passengers.<br/><br/>Technically the game was an improvement on the sister game &quot;Southern Belle&quot;. There were lots more curves included along the line, along with additional lineside buildings and features. Also, the steepness of the gradients was much improved, though this was only because the Somerset and Dorset line was much hillier than the Brighton line. However, the gameplay remained pretty much identical to that of &quot;Southern Belle&quot;, and the two games were similar enough for the casual gamer to mistake one game for the other.

It does not feature any additional playable leagues to the 26 found CM5, but while this will be a disappointment for some fans, the developers insist that this will help them to improve the quality of data found in the existing playable leagues.<br/><br/>On 2 June 2006, to tie in with the 2006 FIFA World Cup, an update pack was released on the Championship Manager website, for the PC. This pack fixed minor problems with the original release of the game, and also included a new mode, as never seen before since Beautiful Game Studios took over the series: International Management Mode.

The heroines do not use firearms but can utilize blunt weapons and certain environmental objects. The game is notable for being panned by critics and has been regarded as one of the worst video games ever made.<br/><br/>Based in the 3D beat-em-up realm, the game begins on a beach beauty pageant runway. Wearing swimsuits, Natalie and Alex must each individually fight their way from the beach through the community and warehouses to the docks. Joined there by Dylan, the three continue to each fight their way through a series of enemy locations (ships, islands, monasteries, etc.).<br/><br/>The gameplay is very simple, and involves fighting groups of enemies while progressing through the levels. Simply by performing combos, using weapons or fighting barehanded to defeat the enemies, the player will progress through the game. While the player is engaged in a fight, movement to another area is impossible, as invisible walls will block your way. Also, Charlie's Angels features an option to switch from playing one Angel to another. However, this option is not available during a fight, and it is not required to complete the game. Occasionally, one Angel must perform a task such as pressing a switch, pulling a lever, or accessing a computer so that another Angel is allowed to progress.

Although she wants nothing to do with him due to his family's poor economic status, he decides to write her a heartfelt love letter. When the letter is stolen, it is up to the protagonist to travel around the village and retrieve all of its pieces. The gameplay of Chulip revolves around improving the player's reputation with the citizens in order to access all parts of the town. To do this, the player must impress each member of the community and then kiss them.<br/><br/>Chulip was directed by Yoshirou Kimura, a former employee of Love-de-Lic. Kimura wanted the game's focus to be on kissing in public, a more Western-accepted custom, within a Japanese setting.  So the player must improve the hero's reputation in the community of Long Life Town by kissing its various citizens. The player's health is represented by a number of hearts. To gain more hearts the player has to find and kiss other characters in the game. Finding out how and when to kiss other characters is a puzzle in of itself. The game and each of its non-player characters (NPCs) follow a 24-hour day schedule. In the daytime, many of the NPCs of the game are walking around the streets. To succeed in kissing an NPC, the player is required to wait for the correct time where they will be happy and press the corresponding button. The player must sometimes complete a certain task for that NPC. Choosing the wrong time to kiss will often result in the player getting hit and losing health. Exploring Long Life Town presents the player with numerous environmental hazards discovered by trial and error. For instance, attempting to use the town's playground equipment or being suddenly shot at by the night-patrolling policeman will cause instant death. One mission ends in the player being struck by lightning, removing more than ten hearts and resulting in a game over if the player does not have sufficient health.<br/><br/>Some denizens of Chulip only come out of their underground, living apartments through holes in the ground at certain times of the day. If the player looks through these holes, clues are given in regard to when they come out or when to kiss them. After an NPC comes out of the ground, the player has a very limited opportunity to give them a kiss. If the player successfully kisses enough NPCs and returns home to sleep, the hero's father will recite his progress and the Lover's Tree will give the player more hearts and an improved reputation if he advances. Secondary to improving his reputation, the player must track down all the pieces to the &quot;Love Letter Set&quot; by traveling throughout Long Life Town. As the story progresses, the player gains access to new areas of the game world via train, which include many more underground residents and hazards. Saving takes place in various bathrooms.

It is sometimes referred to as the leading chariot simulator in the gaming industry with its complex control scheme seen as one of the key elements in enhancing its underlying sense of realism. Although Circus Maximus is regarded as a colossal commercial failure, it has a vast cult following of players who annually have a tournament on Xbox Live known as 'Maximus Week: The Maximum Circus Maximus Experience!' The tournament involves a large elimination process until the final two chariot teams remain, and they do duel in Circus Maximus! The game has also received a great deal of criticism from gaming critics for the incorporation of Team Fantasy, a very flamboyant and surreal team of chariot racers. Critics believe that this is one of the greatest issues with the game, citing that it expanded the games parameters from a seemingly realistic chariot racing battle to fantasy fairy tale where elephants could be locked in mortal combat with dragons in the streets of Rome.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "116686": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Savage Insider (Issue 3 - Jan 2012)", "rpgproducer": {"13964": "Aaron Acevedo"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1192037.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"11118": "Savage Insider"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"70948": "Crypt of the Crystal Lich (Part 3)"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgissueversion": {"145075": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1192037_t.png", "description": "From the publisher's website<br/><br/>What Lurks in the Shadows is a cross-genre horror issue with content covering modern, action, fantasy, and sci-fi horror.

The series consists of this game, the mobile phone game Code Age Brawls, and the manga Code Age Archives.<br/><br/>The story of the game depicts the struggles of people surviving in a fictional &quot;intraglobular world&quot; menaced by an impending destruction, mysterious warped creatures, and different factions warring against each other. The game focuses successively on the viewpoints of four main protagonists.<br/><br/>Code Age Commanders is an action role-playing game divided in missions, in which the goal is to fight enemies called &quot;Coded&quot; to reach a certain area of the map, where a boss must sometimes be defeated. The player controls one character while other allies are computer-controlled and must not die for the mission to be successful. Between two missions, the player can select in a menu numerous optional cut scenes to watch and which reveal the memories of the Coded defeated, while stages already completed can be re-explored. The game features four successive main playable characters, and items and skills learned by one is each time passed to the next.<br/><br/>Weapons are equipped on both hands of the characters and are used with the circle and cross buttons. Pressing both buttons in succession is necessary to execute combos. The other buttons are used to lock focus onto an enemy, guard, dash, or manually change the camera angle. The number of attacks and blocks is limited by an energy meter for each arm, which decreases after each move but replenishes with time.<br/><br/>A third meter increases after each combo and allows when maxed out to perform a &quot;Code Drive&quot; attack. Executed with the triangle button, a Code Drive triggers a brief close-up sequence in which a blue circle appears around the character. If the player presses a second button before the circle shifts to red, a powerful special attack will be unleashed. If the enemy blocks the Code Drive, a second, shorter close-up sequence is triggered. Enemies can also perform Code Drives, in which case the player's button press allows for protection rather than attack. Executing Code Drives frequently can cause the weapon used to upgrade, or the character to go into a &quot;Code Crisis&quot;; a mode which reduces speed and renders immune to attack, but slowly drains hit points.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Code Age Commanders&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "116690": {"poll": {}, "name": "Blitzschnell", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1192282_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1192282.png", "boardgameversion": {"145079": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1027": {"name": "Trivia"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Objective: collect as many question cards as possible making the correct and fastest reply<br/>1 draw a question card and read content to everyone - e.g. 'river'<br/>2 turn the wheel - it determines the initial letter of the river to be named<br/>3 the fastest reply receives the card (1 winning point)<br/>4 if answer was wrong return an additional card<br/><br/>remarks:<br/>predecessor of 'Stadt-Land-Fluss'<br/>can be played as teams, too<br/>due to the spelling of Cologne 'C&ouml;ln', which was recommended between 1900 and 1919, game had to be published at that period<br/><br/>"}, "116691": {"poll": {}, "name": "Nos Cinq Sens", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3488896_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4652": {"name": "Creative Educational Aids Pvt.

It examines an Iranian strategic alternative that&rsquo;s becoming increasingly plausible in light of the draw down of US military strength in the Middle East. That is, just as it did in Cold War Europe, the prospect of both sides having nuclear weapons in this &ldquo;zone of confrontation&rdquo; may work to create a deterrent umbrella that, at least for some time, could allow for a potentially decisive conventional war to go on underneath the threat of &ldquo;mutually assured destruction.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Oil War: Iran Strikes (OW) is a low-intermediate complexity design set in a timeframe of the near future &ndash; 2013 through 2017 &ndash; in which the Iranians may indeed have developed some kind of nuclear capability. At that same time, with the &ldquo;War on Terror&rdquo; having likely slithered to an indecisive end by then, and the US therefore likely fallen back into another post-Vietnam-type &ldquo;neo-isolationist&rdquo; phase, the possibility for a blitz-style Iranian conventional military victory &ndash; aimed at establishing and certifying Tehran as the hegemon of the Gulf region &ndash; moves to the fore.<br/>           <br/>OW examines the strategic and operational possibilities and parameters inherent in the opening Iranian offensive of such a war. There are no rules for the use of atomic bombs or other weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The situation is on such a hair trigger in regard to that aspect of things, if one such weapon were to go off, many more detonations would be certain to follow. The idea is for Iran to gain a victory without resorting to &ldquo;game changing&rdquo; WMD.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map equals 18 miles (30 km) from side to opposite side, and its coverage stretches from Turkey in the north to the UAE in the south, and from the Iranian border and Persian Gulf on the east to Baghdad and Riyadh on the west. Each game turn represents three days, with a full match covering the first month of the war.<br/>Units of maneuver are corps, divisions, brigades, and US brigade combat teams (BCT) of various kinds, each containing from about 5,000 to 15,000 men and/or 50 to 400 armored fighting vehicles or helicopters. The most up-to-date data available have been used to establish each participant country&rsquo;s detailed order or battle, including the Iranian regular army (Artesh), Basij (martyr force) and Revolutionary Guards, along with the ground forces of Iraq (loyalist and insurgent militias and regulars, Kurds, and the &ldquo;elite&rdquo; Quick Reaction Force). There are also the armies of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, Syria, Turkey and, of course, the US.<br/><br/>Special rules cover such things as: sudden death victories and victories on points, variable phase sequences, US naval supremacy, unique Saudi combat5 characteristics, geographic and multi-national movement and combat restrictions, US locking zones of control, US bases, Kuwaiti border defenses, Iraqi unit defections, Al Qods terror attacks, massed Basij suicide attacks, Basra&rsquo;s critical logistical status, Iranian airborne and marine units, artillery, combat engineers, airpower, UN intervention, unique US BCT capabilities, the legend of the 12th Imam, and much more.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"145214": "Modern War Magazine edition"}, "average": "6.552", "name": "Oil War: Iran Strikes", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "25", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"41412": "Country: Qatar"}}}
