Over the course of six rounds, they need to collect as many influence points as possible by skillfully placing their novices to achieve that goal.<br/><br/>The players move their novices over seven islands surrounding a temple island. The novices are placed according to the &quot;worker movement&quot; principle, i.e. they aren't placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before. Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you're in the right place at the right time, you'll gain the deciding influence points. You'll have to build new shrines, work at the temple, and participate in the Priestess' divine services.

Because of all the gameplay real estate in Cruel Necessity, mounting the boards using our print-on-demand publishing model would have raised the Retail Price to $55.00 (i.e., a $15 increase), and that just seemed like too much.

Initially developed by Microsoft Research, the game was later released under a shared source license in 2004 and is now maintained and developed by volunteers.<br/><br/>The story in which the game is set takes place circa 2150, shortly after the destruction of Earth by an asteroid. This cataclysm forced the remnants of humanity to the stars in search of new land and resources. Humanity quickly fractures into four main factions:<br/><br/>The militaristic Iron Coalition, descendants of a United Nations-sanctioned peacekeeping force.<br/>GigaCorp, a transplanetary corporation bent on controlling all natural resources.<br/>Belters, a motley collection of traders, freedom fighters and pirates.<br/>and the Bios, a mysterious off shoot of genetically engineered humans with their own agenda for &quot;stalegenes&quot;.<br/>In the midst of the ensuing civil war, humans discover the alien Rixian Unity. An ancient and advanced race, the Rixians seek to &quot;enlighten&quot; heathen races (such as the human race) and convert them to their religion.<br/><br/>Allegiance was first released for multiplayer on the Microsoft Zone under the name Allegiance Zone. This was a paid subscription service but free play was available on the Free Zone (which had fewer features). The game never achieved commercial success however, selling a mere 29000 units in the first year of release[9] and the official servers closed in 2002. During its brief retail life Allegiance had drawn a dedicated following that continued to play beyond Microsoft's discontinuation of support for Allegiance.

The title is a sequel to the 1994 PC game System Shock, and was co-developed by Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios. The sequel was originally designed as a standalone title with no relation to System Shock; story changes were made when Electronic Arts&mdash;who owned the Shock franchise rights&mdash;signed on as publisher. System Shock 2 was released on August 11, 1999 in North America.<br/>The game takes place on board a starship in a cyberpunk depiction of 2114. The player assumes the role of a lone soldier trying to stem the outbreak of a genetic infection that has devastated the ship. Like System Shock, gameplay consists of first person shooting and exploration. A role-playing system allows the player to develop unique skills and traits, such as hacking and psionic abilities.<br/>System Shock 2 received positive reviews when released, but failed to meet commercial sales expectations. In retrospect, many critics have determined the game to be highly influential, particularly on first person shooters, and far ahead of its time, and inducted it into several &quot;greatest games of all time&quot; lists. In January 2006, Computer and Video Games reported System Shock 3 may be under development. As of January 2009, nothing conclusive has surfaced regarding the purported project's status.

SF OGL based.<br/><br/>Back of the Book: The Sirius Treaty, forged between the star-faring species to prevent a galaxy-wide war. It had a simple aim: to prevent the deadly, interstellar conflict spiraling out of control. Its intent was more sinister - to constrain and leash the newest species in the galaxy: humanity.<br/><br/>But the United Nations of Earth and the Core Worlds of humanity need to expand, need to find new planets to colonise. Resources remain scarce so the conflict still goes on, though in a different guise and monitoried by the ever-vigilant Invigilators, the sinister force set up to enforce the tenets of the Sirius Treaty.<br/><br/>In Hyperlite:The Sirius Treaty, players take the role of UNE Special Forces legionnaires tasked with troubleshooting, exploring new planets, seeking out vital resources and searching for Precursor artefacts. They have all the technology Earth can give them: cranial implants, library jacks, subdermal armour... and they are equipped with the finest swords, shields, bows and armour that the UNE can supply.<br/><br/>See <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sceaptunegames.co.uk/shop/hyperlite.htm' rel='nofollow'>http://www.sceaptunegames.co.uk/shop/hyperlite.htm</a><br/><br/>"}, "70574": {"boardgamedesigner": {"9362": {"name": "Ayumu Kitazaki"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cirno's Math Game", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2009", "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": {"5601": "Anime & Manga"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic794223_t.jpg", "average": "5.83333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"16705": {"name": "Ayu-ya"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic794223.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"34775": "Japanese offset version"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>A fan-made version of the Japanese card game &quot;Neu&quot;, a fast and simple multiplayer card-game with quite some similarities to Uno.<br/><br/>In Cirno's Math Game, players have a hand of three cards numbered from 1 to 9. They play these cards in turn, refilling their hand as they play. Each card adds to the total sum. The player who plays a card that makes the sum exceed 12 (Cirno can't count to more than twelve) loses and gets a loss point. The game ends when someone has three loss points.<br/><br/>Apart from the numbered cards, there are the &quot;divide by 2&quot; card, the &quot;multiply by 2&quot; card, and then there are the special cards &quot;Turn&quot; (reverse play order), &quot;Pass&quot; (play passes to the next player), &quot;Shot&quot; (choose a player, it's now his turn) and &quot;Double&quot; (next player has to play two cards). The special cards you draw when you lose a round can also be used as special cards. Also, the card with a 9 in a circle makes the total a nine - always. Whenever a 9 is involved, Cirno will full of self-confidence reply &quot;nine&quot;.<br/><br/>This game is based on the flash animation &quot;Cirno's Perfect Math Classroom&quot; in which the character Cirno tries to learn math by adding and subtracting. The flash animation is in turn based on an internet meme regarding one of the boss characters from the video game &quot;Embodiment of Scarlet Devil&quot;, a home made shooting game for Windows. A note in the manual caused the fan base to declare Cirno being a total dimwit, closely associated with the number 9, mostly depicted in a circle.<br/><br/>Translated box back:<br/>Cirno's Math Game ~ let's study with your friends<br/>is a game where Cirno studies math (mostly addition) with her friends because she one day thought that<br/>I'm not stupid! I know! Math is clever!<br/><br/>The rules are simple. Each turn, play a card, draw a card. The card's number is added to the sum total, and the player who plays a card which causes the total to exceed Cirno's comprehension span (12), is out. The lesson is redone many times, and the most competent player becomes THE PERFECT CIRNO.<br/><br/>When you are out, you get a &quot;friend&quot; card. The friend cards can be used to change hands, make Cirno be able to count to 20 and so on. Perhaps they can help you turn the tables?<br/><br/>With simple rules and a quick tempo, this is a card game with the power enough to improve your brain somewhat, playable for all people, from those already married to Cirno, to those who barely know what project Shrine Maiden is.<br/><br/>For 2-6 players<br/>Playtime: 5-15 minutes<br/>Recommended age: Older than a fairy<br/><br/>"}, "70575": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"176334": "English/European GameCube edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic763341.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"4972": "Dungeons & Dragons"}, "videogamecharacter": {"26365": "Drizzt Do'Urden"}, "usersrated": "136", "average": "6.88787", "videogamegenre": {"2339": "Action RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4423": "Game Boy Advance"}, "videogamehonor": {"30184": "2002 D.I.C.E.

It was released on several platforms between 2001-2004.<br/><br/>In Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance up to two players take on the roles of one of three mercenary heroes (Human Archer, Dwaven Warrior or Elven Sorceress) who embark on an adventure to save first the city of Baldur's Gate and then the whole Faerun continent from an alliance of evil beings bent on its submission and destruction.<br/><br/>In Dark Alliance players get missions from PCs in local settlements to explore the associated dungeon areas, uncovering plot points and compelling the game whilst hoarding weapons, equipment and loot. The game is played as a top down view hack and slash fantasy adventure game. As players progress they gain experience by defeating enemies and completing tasks. As is the case with many RPGs, this experience allows the characters to 'level up', increasing their stats and gaining skill points which can be spent to gain new abilities unique to each character.<br/><br/>Dark Alliance was not only the first Baldur's Gate game to be released on consoles (rather then just on PC/Mac) but also the first game to implement the 3rd Edition rules of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG system. It boasted several improvements upon previous video game instalments at the time, including advanced 3D graphics and the option to play through the game either with just 1 player or 2 players cooperatively.<br/><br/>The Game Boy Advance version features several differences to the console ports, including no coop mode, only one playable character (Human, although Class can be picked from Fighter, Archer or Mage), several new side quests, no jumping and a new character class (Elven Fighter) is unlocked upon the game's completion.<br/><br/>Dark Alliance was a commercial success, and gained many awards including the 2001 Role-Playing Game of The Year award from Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences and appeared on many Top 100 Game Lists.<br/><br/>The sequel Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II was also released in 2004 exclusively on the Playstation 2 and XBox.<br/><br/>"}, "70577": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Cybercon", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic996289_t.png", "average": "0", "boardgamepublisher": {"11925": {"name": "Elvin Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic996289.png", "boardgameversion": {"34810": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "poll": {}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Cybercon is a game of Fences! each person is attempting to complete a line of marbles from one border to an opposite border while at the same time trying to block another player from doing the same thing.

The Trollland is now infested with Men, who ate cooked meat, Elves with dubious habits, Gobs who played barbarian music and hardworking Dwarves who steal the trolls jobs. As a result, Trollland is now in full decadence.<br/><br/>The Troll king has decided to set it straight and put things back in order. As a troll governor, your mission is to arrest and send back home, in carriages or in dragon charters, as many unwanted aliens as possible.

Teams and tanks can be ordered to move, lay suppressive fire, rally, find cover, and charge the enemy.<br/><br/>The focus on team command is emphasized by providing the player with a highly unstable firing capability.

Even though it brought back the eclectic excessive esthetics of its predecessors, Guilty Gear X2 provided gamers with a more technical approach.<br/><br/>It is considered by many to be the best 2D fighter ever produced, although it has suffered from severe balance issues ever since the first Guilty Gear game, and a lot of 2D fighting fanatics prefer less luxuriant graphics. It uses a gauge system, akin to Street Fighter Alpha's Super Combo techniques, allowing &quot;super&quot; specials and one-hit &quot;Destroy&quot; kills.<br/><br/>GGX2 uses six buttons, generally corresponding to a punch, a kick, a slash [weapon], and heavy slash [slower harder strike]. The fifth button taunts or greets the opponent, who thereby gains tension in his or her gauge. GGX2 also features a Dust button [which can be used to sweep enemies or propell them into the air to initiate air-combos.]<br/><br/>The main characters of the series are Sol Badguy, Ky Kiske, Potemkin, Millia Rage, Zato-1 [Eddie], May, and Potemkin. The main antagonist is Justice, a sentient robot &quot;gear&quot; system who resides at what appears to be the gates of heaven. Throughout the years, however, more characters gained prominence. GGX2's roster contains 23 characters. Although two versions of RoboKy exist.<br/><br/>The game's main slogan &quot;Heaven or Hell, let's rock&quot; fits very well with the overall musical theme of the game. Daisuke Ishiwatari's musical preferences permeate the game's presentation, characters, storyline, and even the names of the special moves yelled by the characters. &quot;Ride the lightning!&quot;<br/><br/>As mention above, several versions and re-editions of Guilty Gear XX exist. Most of which bring minor changes to the original. The main difference, usually, consists of the addition or omission of the RoboKy character, who plays more like a quicker mobile unorthodox variation of the original Ky than the clunky bomb-ejecting robot of later adaptations. The latest version, although not always welcomed by fans of the series, adds Order Sol and A.B.A. to the roster.<br/><br/>"}, "70615": {"statistics": {}, "name": "MadWorld", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"79207": "European Wii edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1076088.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "usersrated": "35", "average": "6.45", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "videogamehonor": {"31149": "2009 Spike Best Nintendo Console Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1076088_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box: SPECTACULAR MAYHEM!

Its leader, Vindel Mauser, desires a world of eternal war to make humanity improve more through war. His plan is to send his agents towards another dimension, spy on the defense forces of the world in order to make adjustments on the attack, and eventually conquer it.<br/><br/>The player is given a choice as one of the two possible volunteers of the dimensional jump to the &quot;Advance&quot; world from the Shadow-Mirror universe and will later discover through their own way whether the Shadow-Mirror is right or wrong.<br/><br/>Axel Almer is one of the two selectable characters. He is one of the top agents of the Shadow-Mirror and is in a relationship with its top researcher, Lemon Browning. He used to be a cold-hearted, but dedicated soldier towards the belief of the Shadow Mirror. If chosen as the main protagonist, Axel will suffer amnesia due to his jump and will develop second thoughts on the Shadow-Mirror's intentions throughout the course of the game. The player may choose the Ash Saver or the Laz Angriff if playing on a real robot route or the Soulgain or Vaisaga on a super robot route.<br/><br/>Lamia Loveless is the other selectable character. She is an android created from Lemon's W-Series project, in the hopes she can create an artificial intelligence on par with humans. Lamia is the 17th creation, thus nicknamed &quot;W17&quot;. As a machine, she is bound to orders, which is an obstacle towards Lemon's intended purpose on her. If chosen as the protagonist, Lamia's communication device will be damaged in the jump, causing her to develop a broken grammar speech pattern and unable to contact her superiors, allowing her freedom to move around in the mission, while enabling her to develop her own consciousness and making decisions of her own. Lamia can pilot any of the mechs Axel can, with the exception of the Soulgain; in its place is the Angelg.<br/><br/>The original robots debuting in Super Robot Wars Advance are based on the original robots in Super Robot Wars 64.

The game supports 2-4 players in multiplayer and features over 75 missions.<br/><br/>Koma (panel) is the term for the characters that the player can use in the game. Each koma uses from 1 to 7 squares of the koma deck at the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS. The deck has 20 squares (4 x 5) for the player to place his koma.<br/>There are three types of koma: help koma, support koma and battle koma.<br/><br/>Help koma are only one square large. They'll boost up or help players in the game, but they will not appear on Battle Screen.<br/>Support koma are two to three squares large. These koma will show up briefly on the battle screen to help the player, generally by attacking, blocking, restoring health, or some other move.<br/><br/>Battle koma are four to seven squares large, and these koma fight throughout each round. These koma represents the characters that the player controls in the battle screen, and the player can switch between characters by tapping their koma in the koma deck like a tag battle.<br/><br/>The player can build and store up to ten koma decks, and each deck must have at least one help koma, one support koma and one battle koma to be valid for use in battle. There are also a set of predefined decks that the player can use, but the player cannot change or delete those. It is also possible to exchange decks between friends, but they won't be able to edit the decks.<br/>Ally boosting is done by placing koma next to each other in the deck maker. If the koma placed next to each other are &quot;compatible&quot;, their attributes will go up.

There are no plans for the game to be released outside of Japan, largely due to international licensing issues for the plethora of series represented.[citation needed]<br/><br/>The game keeps many features from its predecessor, and adds many more. The game boasts 305 characters (56 of which are fully playable) from 41 different Sh\u014dnen manga series compared to 160 characters (34 fully playable) from 27 different manga in the original. However, the characters from Hikaru no Go and Mr. Fullswing do not return in this sequel (Steel Ball Run is unaccounted for because it has been revised into a story arc within JoJo's Bizarre Adventure between the releases of both games).&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Jump_Ultimate_Stars,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70626": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic743618.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2336": {"name": "Kevin Wilson"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgamepublisher": {"17": {"name": "Fantasy Flight Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic743618_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "At the Fantasy Flight Games event center, they held an event titled &quot;The Realms of Terrinoth Event&quot; which was a collection of gaming events for Descent, Runebound, and Runewars.<br/> As a promo item handed out to attendees, they received this 24-page booklet which is a Scenario Guide promo for Descent and Runewars.<br/><br/>Inside are three scenarios for Descent and one for Runewars.<br/><br/>Descent Scenarios :<br/><br/><br/>    1 : Snitty State of the Invincible Overlords<br/><br/><br/>This quest pits one overlord against another -- Red versus Blue -- in a low stakes battle of dungeon mastery.

Are you a teacher or librarian who would like to introduce your students to the game, but you're reluctant to take on the regular time commitment of a full-blown campaign?<br/><br/>There are a great many reasons to share D&amp;D with kids. Besides being just the kind of imaginative play that kids naturally engage in, Dungeons &amp; Dragons develops an array of essential educational skills, including:<br/><br/><br/>     Math skills<br/>     Reading skills<br/>     Writing skills<br/>     Cooperation and leadership<br/>     Problem-solving<br/>     Creative thinking<br/><br/><br/>We've heard from many of you out there that you've been wanting to unlock these benefits for your kids, but you feel that they're not ready for the basic game or you just don&rsquo;t have the time to run your own campaign. So we put together this variation, based on the new novel for young readers, Monster Slayers by Lukas Ritter. Monster Slayers: The Heroes of Hesiod captures the flavor, fun, and educational benefits of Dungeons &amp; Dragons in a fast-paced, easy-to-learn experience for kids ages six years old and up.<br/><br/>Monster Slayers: The Heroes of Hesiod requires no previous knowledge of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and all you need to play is included in this adventure, aside from a few dice and pencils (and some friends to play it with). Play time can be as little as fifteen minutes or as long as an hour, depending on how many monsters you run.<br/><br/>Monster Slayers: The Heroes of Hesiod isn't just for kids. It's also a fun diversion for experienced players who need their D&amp;D fix but don&rsquo;t have the time for a full-length game.

The human fighter Rannek is a master of melee combat. Illius, a sorcerer, casts spells to protect his friends or attack his enemies. A half-drow, half-wood-elf rogue named Zhai easily vanishes into the shadows before sneaking up on her enemy for the kill.<br/><br/>The two villains are equally enemies of the heroes and of each other. The first villain &mdash;Ygorl&mdash;is the leader of the Slaad army. Cireka, general of the Githyanki, is the second. The game's introduction explains that the only thing keeping each of them from taking over the realm is their hatred of each other. Fearing that the realm would be at the mercy of whichever villain was victorious, the great mage Khelben Blackstaff sealed them both within a Demon Stone.<br/><br/>The story develops as the three heroes battle two orc armies near the jewel-rich Gemspark Mines. A great red dragon, sent by Ygorl, leads the group to these mines. Once there, they unwillingly release Ygorl and Cireka from the Demon Stone and into the world. The three heroes must undo their mistake by joining forces to right the wrong they caused ...before the realm is lost.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Players have control over all three characters and can change character at any time (after all three main heroes arrive). There are many fighting moves, and players must use each character's skills to play the game effectively. Rannek uses a sword and breaks things with his gauntlets. Illius fights with a staff and uses magic (the game's most powerful ranged attack; the other two can throw knives (Zhai) or axes(Rannek)). Zhai uses two daggers and becomes invisible in shadows&mdash;this is useful for sneaking up on enemies and killing them. Bosses overpower characters in one-on-one fighting but can be defeated with the combined power of all three heroes. Although much of the game is hack-and-slash, there are several tasks that require the use of various skills.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Forgotten_Realms:_Demon_Stone,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70686": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Hitman 2: Silent Assassin", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"116439": "English/European Windows edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic753435.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5156": "Hitman"}, "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "videogamegenre": {"2167": "Shooter"}, "usersrated": "98", "average": "7.33133", "videogamefranchise": {"6410": "Best of Classics (Best Selling Xbox Games, PAL)"}, "videogameplatform": {"4425": "GameCube"}, "videogamehonor": {"29727": "2003 D.I.C.E.

The Orcs, now under the leadership of Ner'zhul, staged a new invasion of Azeroth and overwhelmed the citadel of Nethergarde, which guarded the remnants of the portal. The Alliance itself had been splintered after the Second War and Gilneas and Stromgarde had withdrawn their support. The arch-mage Khadgar summoned heroes of Azeroth, Alleria Windrunner, Danath Trollbane, Turalyon and Kurdran Wildhammer to rally the forces of the Alliance. The Horde was beaten back and Khadgar decided to take the initiative to push through the Portal into the Orcs' homeland. Before being pushed back, Ner'zhul managed to steal the spellbook of Medivh which was needed to create new Portals.<br/><br/>The Alliance gained a foothold and made preparations to seal the rift forever while the Orcs reorganized. Khadgar needed the spellbook of Medivh and the Skull of Gul'dan to accomplish it. They razed the Shadowmoon Citadel, seat of Ner'zhul's Shadow Council. While the Alliance army and navy only barely held out, Khadgar managed to acquire the items with help from the Laughing Skull Clan. Ner'zhul managed to open portals to the Twisting Nether and escaped through one of the new Portals. The violent energies began to destroy Draenor and also threatened Azeroth. Khadgar destroyed the Portal on the side of Draenor to prevent harm to Azeroth, trapping the remaining Alliance forces beyond the Dark Portal in the dying land of Draenor. Khadgar and the warriors of Azeroth then entered one of the portals not knowing where it would lead to avoid being killed by the violent rifts tearing the planet apart. With the release of World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade, it is revealed that the Alliance forces actually remained on Draenor rather than escaping through a portal as said in Beyond the Dark Portal's ending.

The land is divided and ruled by two large warring factions: the Empire and the Federation.

Originally this game had nothing to do with Bowser, Yoshi, or any of his friends, but was actually &quot;rebranded&quot; to include these famous characters when the game was ported over to the United States.  <br/>In Tetris Attack, you need to think fast to match up colored blocks to erase them from your side to keep your block wall low.  Adding to the complexity of this simple concept is the fact that if you are able to create a group of 4 or more blocks that will be erased at one time, you begin to send chucks of blocks over to your opponent's side.  This back-and-forth struggle ends when one person's screen fills all the way to the top.  There are additional modes that the game offers including a Puzzle Mode where you are given a set amount of moves to clear all the blocks off of your screen.<br/><br/>Tetris Attack was released in 1995 in Japan and 1996 in the US for the SNES.<br/><br/>"}, "70794": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Bob, Lord of Evil", "rpgproducer": {"37405": "Sue Benger"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic719478.jpg", "usersrated": "10", "rpgitemversion": {"86046": "PDF Version"}, "average": "9.5", "rpggenre": {"185": "Comedy / Satire"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic719478_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Book:<br/><br/>The Dark Lands, ruled by Bob, Lord of Evil, is a silly place where you can play light-hearted adventures with a techno-fantasy-horror theme.

The Macintosh version used a video player developed by Sierra instead of an off-the-shelf technology such as Quicktime, and had a tendency to crash or run slowly on 680x0 processors.

The game was designed by Jane Jensen, Gabriel Knight's creator. In a departure from the previous two entries, the score is composed by David Henry, expanding on some of original composer Robert Holmes's themes. The game also sees Tim Curry return in the role of Gabriel although the voices of other re-occurring characters such as Grace and Mosely have been recast. It was released in 1999 for PCs and again in 2001 as a part of Sierra's Best Seller Series.<br/><br/>Each installment in the Gabriel Knight series has had a significant change in graphic design, with the first featuring computer-generated, partially rotoscoped graphics as well as scanned comic book art and the second being entirely FMV. Gabriel Knight 3 is the first game in the series to be in full 3D. Despite critical and financial success it would be the last adventure game published by Sierra.<br/><br/>The plot of the game now concentrates on vampires (previous titles concentrated on the paranormal aspects of Voodoo, and werewolves) but also has a great deal to do with the history of the Knights Templar, the proposed conspiracies relating to the Freemasons and The Priory of Sion as well as Jesus.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Gabriel_Knight_3:_Blood_of_the_Sacred,_Blood_of_the_Damned,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70840": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Panzer Tactics DS", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"35530": "US DS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic726663.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2273": "War - World War II"}, "usersrated": "13", "average": "8.10769", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic726663_t.jpg", "description": "From the Back of the Box<br/><br/>The year is 1939, and the world is on the brink of one of the greatest conflicts in human history: The Second World War.<br/><br/>Prepare to assume command of one of the three most powerful armies of that time: the German Wehrmacht, the Red Army or the Western Allies.

The games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and, while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between them in order to complete the games' Pok&eacute;dexes.<br/><br/>The games received generally favorable reviews. Most critics praised the addition of Wi-Fi features and felt that the gameplay, though it had not received much updating from previous games, was still engaging. Reviewers were divided on the graphics, however; and the audio was criticized as being primitive. The games enjoyed more commercial success than their Game Boy Advance predecessors: with around 15 million units sold worldwide, Diamond and Pearl have sold around 1 million more units than Ruby and Sapphire and almost 3 million more units than FireRed and LeafGreen.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Pok\u00e9mon_Diamond_and_Pearl,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70842": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Nanostray", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"35534": "US DS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic721545.jpg", "videogameseries": {"10480": "Nanostray"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "8", "average": "6.625", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic721545_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Nanostray is a vertical scrolling shooter video game for the Nintendo DS.

Fireteam Bravo 2 features an entirely new campaign, multiplayer maps, and new features such as Command Equity (CE) and Local Influence (LI) (see below). Fireteam Bravo 2's campaign mode offers 14 story missions, a variety of partners including the sniper LONESTAR, and two partners codenamed BRONCO and WRAITH, a support gunner and stealth/CQC specialist, from SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs: Mobile Recon which was only available for cell phones, and an innumerable number of dynamically generated instant action missions. Rather than spanning multiple countries like past games in the series, the game takes place solely in the fictional country of Adjikistan. The country is supposedly situated somewhere in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region of Central Asia and features a number of environment and climate zones, allowing for the game to feature a wide variety of landscapes and settings while working within one large, connected story.

It was the first game to include the name &quot;Sid Meier&quot; in its title as an effort by MicroProse to attract fans of Meier's earlier games, most of which were flight simulators[1]. The game is a simulation of the life of a pirate (more accurately, a privateer) in the Spanish Main in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.<br/><br/>Pirates! is a single-player game. The player receives a letter of marque authorizing service as a privateer  for Spain, the Dutch Republic, England, or France in the Caribbean. The player's loyalties may change over the course of the game; he may also hold rank with multiple countries and may turn to piracy at any time. Gameplay is open-ended; the player may choose to attack enemy ships or towns, hunt pirates, seek buried treasure, rescue long-lost family members, or even avoid violence altogether and seek to increase his wealth through trade. The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. Also, as the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point he is given a position in his future life, from beggar to King's adviser, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments.<br/><br/>The game tests a wide range of skills: hand-eye coordination  during the fencing sections, tactical ability during the land and sea combat phases, and strategic thinking, for everything from choosing a wife to deciding when to divide up the plunder. Moreover, each game is likely to take a different course, as most events in the game are random, including the economic and political systems, and early in the game these can greatly affect future strategic options. &quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Sid_Meier's_Pirates!,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70867": {"boardgamedesigner": {"37483": {"name": "Crystal Neal"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Rapture Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "1989", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic720612_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic720612.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"35569": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Players alternate turns by drawing Fellowship Cards.

Each terrain type provides specific benefits or obstacles to the different game pieces. Opposing pieces, printed as blue and red chess pieces (but which may be substituted by actual chess pieces), are initially placed in specific locations designated on the game board. Each type of piece has a unique type of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, by its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece, as in chess. Each side takes turns moving a single one of their pieces trying to gain positional advantage, capture opponents, and achieve their objectives. The Cardinal&rsquo;s pawn type pieces are an important exception to normal movement rules.  If a pawn is selected to be moved, a total of two pawns may move during a single turn.  These are the only pieces that may do so.  The Three Musketeer player&rsquo;s knight type pieces may not move until the d&rsquo;Artagnan rook type piece finishes a turn adjacent to each and activates it.  Until they are activated, they face backwards on the game board and may not move.

The Blu-ray disc version was released in Australia and Europe on September 20 and September 21, respectively, but was not released in Japan.[1]<br/><br/>Warhawk was initially intended to have both single-player and multiplayer modes, however the single-player element was canceled during development due to concerns that it was inferior to the game's multiplayer component.[2] The game was released with five maps (each with five possible configurations) and four game types, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Zones and Capture The Flag. After the 1.4 update, the number of game types increased to six with the addition of the Hero and Collection modes. Three optional expansion packs for the game containing new maps and equipment increase the number of available maps to eight.<br/><br/>Warhawk was met with a generally positive reception by reviewers. However, for a few months after its initial launch it was plagued by connection and server issues, including ranking issues with players, which were subsequently corrected in updates.[3] The player is able to rank-up though 20 ranks ranging from Recruit to General, unlocking new personnel and aircraft customization options at each rank.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Warhawk_(2007_video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70910": {"statistics": {}, "name": "MotorStorm", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"46540": "IT PS3 Version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic747056.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5309": "MotorStorm"}, "usersrated": "41", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "average": "6.53659", "videogamefranchise": {"6404": "Greatest Hits (Best Selling PlayStation Games, US)"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "videogamehonor": {"32709": "2008 British Academy Game Awards Best Sports Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic747056_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;MotorStorm is a racing video game developed by Evolution Studios and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the Sony PlayStation 3 computer entertainment system.

The age of the Northern Crusades has begun.The path to virtue, glory and riches lies in front of your heroes, but countless enemies stand between them and their goals: the ruthless Lithuanians of Archduke Mindaugas, the Mongol raiders of Genhgis Khan's Golden Horde, and emerging Russian Princes like young Aleksandr Nevskij. And in the deep woods and dark marshes of the Baltic Coast, fantastic creatures and ancient deities await.<br/><br/>This book contains all the information required to run your Northern Crusade game with the Basic Roleplaying game system, including magic rules for the Christian crusaders and the pagan druids and witches, as well as game statistics for creatures of the Baltic folklore. Create your own scenarios, with your heroes siding either with the Crusading invaders or with the Baltic natives, or play through the included campaign that spans over several years of game time and takes you through the most important events of the Baltic epic.<br/><br/>"}, "70928": {"rpgitemversion": {"35733": "Censored Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Exxxalted: Scroll of Swallowed Darkness", "rpgproducer": {"9821": "John Chambers"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic721254.jpg", "usersrated": "6", "rpgsetting": {"2315": "Age of Sorrows"}, "average": "5.91667", "rpggenre": {"2672": "Adult / Mature"}, "rpg": {"886": "Exalted Second Edition"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic721254_t.jpg", "description": "This was White Wolf Publishing's April Fool's joke for 2009.<br/><br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/><br/>'On the bed, on the floor, by a demon &lsquo;til your sore,<br/>in the tub, in the hall, up against the temple wall'<br/><br/>Mastery of the arts of the bedchamber and playroom comes not easily to all.

It follows our inexperienced hero, Guybrush Threepwood, as he begins his quest to become a mighty pirate. Along the way, you'll have to sharpen your tongue to master the art of sword fightery (insults written by Orson Scott Card!), break and enter for successful in idol stealery, and hone your sense of direction for treasure huntery. You'll meet pirates, mean pirates, ugly pirates, dirty pirates, grog-swiling pirates, smelly pirates, stupid pirates, rude pirates, stranded pirates, important pirates, ghost pirates, and other types of pirates! Also a monkey. You might also consider buying a larger pair of fancy pants, because you'll need some place to store all the loot that you pick up.<br/><br/>Designed by Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer, and Dave Grossman, The Secret of Monkey Island is the fifth game developed using the Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion (SCUMM) engine. It is a story of adventure, excitement, and romance. Monkey Island is a hilarious romp through a comic world of mischief, and also pirates. Did I mention pirates?<br/><br/><br/>The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is an enhanced remake of The Secret of Monkey Island for the PC, Playstation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and iPhone/iPod touch developed internally by LucasArts and released on 15 July 2009.<br/><br/>The Special Edition features new character art and hand-painted environments in the style of the original, presented in 1920 x 1080 widescreen resolution. It also features a re-recorded and re-mastered score, and the principal voice artists from The Curse of Monkey Island read the previously unspoken lines, with Dominic Armato as Guybrush, Alexandra Boyd as Elaine, and Earl Boen as LeChuck.<br/><br/>The interface itself is streamlined, hiding the verb table and inventory that previously took up the lower part of the screen. These, including the nine-option verb table from the enhanced editions of the game, can be pulled up as a menu, while verbs can also be selected by cycling through preset commands. Another new feature is the three-level hint system, which (at the third level) presents a bright yellow arrow showing the player where to go.<br/><br/>It is possible to switch between the 256 color enhanced and the new version of graphics without interrupting the flow of the game. This also switches between the original CD Audio soundtrack and the remastered score with ambient sound effects, and the loss of voice-over work for the original version. The game did insert Spiffy, the famous dog on the back of the original game's box, and removed the infamous stump joke.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "70946": {"videogame": {"81340": "Zehn Adventures: Die Adventure Spielesammlung"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"55972": "English/European Amiga edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic779607.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5072": "Monkey Island"}, "videogametheme": {"2509": "Comedy"}, "videogamefranchise": {"27676": "Better Description Needed"}, "videogamecharacter": {"5161": "Elaine Marley"}, "average": "8.33479", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "usersrated": "434", "videogamecompilation": {"165978": "Monkey Island Madness"}, "poll": {}, "vgcharacterversion": {"218931": "Elaine Marley"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic779607_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge is an adventure game developed and published by LucasArts in 1991.

For example, in Archery, the player holds the Wii Remote vertically to hold the bow, and pulls back the Nunchuk to pull back the bow's string. The new feature that Wii Sports Resort brings is Wii MotionPlus compatibility, which enables 1:1 control and allows the games to be played with greater accuracy. For example, in Wii Sports Tennis, the player's shots were all determined by which direction the Wii Remote is swung like a racket. Wii Sports Resort offers a new variation, Table Tennis (previously featured in Wii Play), where the player has greater control over adding spin to the ball by twisting the Wii Remote while swinging. Wii MotionPlus is required for all Wii Remotes being used with Wii Sports Resort. Most sports with up to 3 or 4 players will allow one Wii Remote to be shared among players while taking turns.

It is scalable, with larger and smaller versions available. A chess-wargame fusion that uses 5 different types of simple short-range chess-like pieces, it mimics various aspects of an ancient battle on a 12x16 rectangular field. Four chiefs [the strongest but not the fastest pieces] per side lead their 32 piece armies in a set-piece battle that begins just after the 2 armies start to close with each other.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by killing all 4 enemy chiefs before your 4 get killed. Players move as many pieces per turn as they have friendly chiefs on the board. The moving pieces must be within &quot;command control range&quot; of the chiefs, generally 3 squares, to be able to move that turn. This forces the royal pieces to be active participants in the heat of the battle, rather than trying to hide in the corners like the kings of chess.<br/><br/>Most games, regardless of size, are determined in 30-40 turns. The game is designed so the pace increases from beginning to end. The players start with 1 chief for every 8 pieces, so they move about 12% of their armies each turn in the beginning. By midgame, 20-25% of the army moves each turn, and by the endgame, roughly 50% of the remaining pieces move each turn.<br/><br/>The game trades space for time compared to western chess. Where attacks in chess are sequenced deeply in time but concentrated in space, in Chieftain multiple attacks are spread out across space, but can't be accurately calculated more than 2 or 3 turns deep in time. It has a deliberate, almost defining theme, yet it is a pure abstract game, with perfect information, and in its specific &quot;combat&quot; pieces and their movement rules, there is no semblance of reality. What it allows is a game played on 2 levels, the tactical level being a pure, simple chess variant, and the strategic level being a simulation of a wargame.<br/><br/>The game may be played online at chessvariants.org, or a Chieftain Chess set can be made from 2 complete sets of chesspieces and 3 same-sized chess boards, one cut in half, for face to face play.<br/><br/>"}, "70984": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Chaotic: Shadow Warriors", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"212854": "North American Nintendo DS edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1701876.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamegenre": {"2414": "Tactical Role-Playing Game"}, "average": "7", "videogamefranchise": {"5412": "Chaotic"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "usersrated": "2", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1701876_t.jpg", "description": "Enter the realm of Chaotic and assume the role of one of its Creatures in this turn-based arena combat fighting game.&nbsp;

This rare breed seeks out lethal conflicts, deadly beasts, and cunning foes with reckless abandon, forever searching for a greater conquest, for the ultimate thrill. Brelin Swift is one such man, but thankfully an honorable nature guides him towards battles that can benefit the world. Born into a noble family on a small prime material world, Brelin spent his adolescence on deadly safaris. His dabbling in the mystical arts provided broad new vistas to hunt: the elemental and outer planes. All the multiverse was his playground, and many of his battles led him to greater and greater mastery of strange spells and incantations which strengthened and empowered his body. And powerful he became. By the time he was 20, Brelin was known as a slayer of demons, devils, and worse, yet he was still not satisfied. He was a good man at heart but the hells could not be changed by his conquests. Dejected, he turned his attention to the mortal realms, and one world caught his attention - Exodus.<br/><br/>"}, "70997": {"rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Hostile Environment 2", "rpgproducer": {"38431": "Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"}, "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic721381.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"35875": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"3944": "NeoExodus: A House Divided"}, "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic721381_t.jpg", "description": "<br/>Publisher's blurb<br/><br/>Every world has its wilderness.

These sinister spider-folk exist on the fringes of First One society, prowling places too dark for even their colleagues.  The Aneishi resemble anthropomorphic spiders.  They have only two arms and two legs, but their bodies are covered with a sturdy brownish carapace and short, bristly hairs, and their faces are more arachnid than humanoid.
