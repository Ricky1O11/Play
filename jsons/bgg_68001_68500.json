European powers had commanded vast tracts of the Pacific region for centuries, and the British Empire remained the largest in history. On the other side of the world, Germany had dominated almost the whole of continental Europe, so the idea of powerful nations taking territory by force was an attractive idea that, today, might seem repugnant.<br/><br/>Despite naval actions in oceans over the globe, it was Japan&rsquo;s entry into the war that truly turned hostilities into a World War. By attacking Pearl Harbour, Japan ensured the United States was put into a position whereby it could no longer remain neutral. No longer was the fighting confined to Europe and Africa, with warships trading blows overseas. Now the people of almost every continent were directly affected by war.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Japan failed in its gamble. Before it fell, however, it had dealt the United States a grievous blow, and all but ended the hold European countries had in the region (not least because they had their own problems back in Europe).

The Japanese knew of the importance of Australia, but lacked the resources to conquer it, so they decided on the next best thing: Isolate Australia from the United States by building an airfield on the island of Guadalcanal, from which planes could disrupt the Allied supply lines.<br/><br/>The United States, ill-prepared as it was for any offensive actions, immediately attacked with the 1st Marine Division under the command of Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift, caught the Japanese by surprise and easily took control of the airfield. The Japanese 17th Army, under the command of Lt. Gen. Harukichi Hyakutake, counterattacked with an ever-increasing number of troops.

One of them is the teller, who read (or imagine) the beginning of a short tale &mdash; his/her current draft. Each other player incarnates a tentative hero (a gnome, a princess, a little boy, etc.) who tries to be the main character of the teller's tale. 3 times during the game, the teller asks the other players how they think things happened at that time of the story. They must choose an item depicted on one of the cards laying at the center of the table and use it to continue the story. Depending on how convincing they are to the teller, and how well they integrated their character and the item to the current twist, they get points in the shape of &quot;quill&quot; markers. Each item can only be used once by any player, who keeps it afterwards, and who puts his/her markers on top of the card.<br/><br/>At the end of the three turns, the two players with the most quill markers are selected to compete in the epilogue. The teller reads (or makes up) an idea of an ending to the story. Now, each finalist in turn has 30 seconds to present a relevant proposal for including his character and both items figured on the two remaining cards on the table into the ending. (A sand timer is included.) Both players have to use the same two objects, but the second one speaking cannot use them in the same way than the first (more or less compensating the fact he had more time to prepare his part).<br/><br/>Eventually, the teller decides which of the two finalists wins, depending on the relevance of their proposals.<br/><br/>The game comes with two proposed variants :<br/>- &quot;Experienced players&quot; : all the players tell the same tale, each one adding an element to the same storyline and bound to continue using the plot of the former speakers.<br/>- &quot;Collective&quot; : there are no quill markers and appraisal given by the teller.

A scorpion the size of a bull? An elephant the size of a pony? A lizard that could eat a tiger? A tiger with 9-inch fangs? The Mythus Bestiary is more than just a list, however.

Denizens of the briny deep are not neglected; a sea voyage might be cut short  by anything from the lowly barracuda and the great white shark to the sea mugger (a giant oceanic crocodile), the serpent whale, or the true sea serpent (as its name implies, there are several such monsters). There is more to Aerth than just the two worlds on the inside and outside, however. The Mythus Bestiary also deals with the strange creatures inhabiting the dank caves and stygian passages of Subterranean Aerth: cave apes, centaurants, smotherslugs, drownweed and other nightmare monsters.<br/><br/>Reptile Men? Intelligent Foxes? Walking Mushrooms? Living Rocks? In addition to the &quot;dumb animals&quot; noted above, the Mythus Bestiary also includes many tribes of humanoids: primitive cave-dwellers, savage lizard-men, flying bat-people... the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>The world of Aerth can be a dangerous place for the unwary.

Gems are used to either win new objects for their mine through simultaneous 4-way auctions, or to enhance their mines, objects, and victory point count. Another innovative part is that each object has to be upgraded to fully use its benefits, e.g. a level 1 dwarf only gives you 1 income per round, some level 3 dwarves give you 3 income.<br/><br/>On the King's way through the mountain, the requirements for upgrading some special cards always change, and only the player who wins the sapphire auction knows where the next turn will lead to.

Central to the game is the concept of the Narrator and Players. The Narrator acts as the author of the Story, describing events and actions taken by secondary characters. Players roleplay the part of Excursionists, the main protagonists of the Story.<br/><br/>When beginning a game of Chthonian it is recommended that the Narrators and the Players are all on the same page. Be sure that everyone knows the Style of play, the themes to be explored throughout, and what their Excursionists are expected to be able and unable to do.<br/><br/>You will notice that there is no Narrator section here. This is because the Narrator needs to know no extra rules outside of Creating an Excursionist and Mechanics. A good Narrator should remember that the Players and the Narrator are creating a Story together, and should encourage suggestions from Players for the Story and allow the Players the full use of their Nodules.<br/><br/>Style<br/><br/>This game is designed to be played with several levels of Style. For fans of action-packed adventures filled with goons that drop like flies from a hero's revolver, the Style is Pulp Adventure. If the Excursionists only slightly better than average at dealing with the supernatural and bizarre, it is called a Weird Tale. The grittiest, and potentially most dangerous Style is a Shocking Discovery, where most Excursionists will wind up dead, mad, or somewhere in between.<br/><br/>Materials<br/><br/>Aside from a pencil and paper, you should have a twelve-sided die, a duodecahedron being the weirdest of the regular polyhedrons.

Sometimes you need a castle or a mansion as a setting for your game, but have o time to create an elaborate building.  You grab something of your role-playing collection and skim the book for a floor plan your players don't already know and that fits, or you try to avoid the problem with some scribbled lines and a lot of phrases to describe the house.  As long term game masters, we have often been in this situation, and now we want to help you as well.  That is the reason why this booklet was created, a collection of complex floor plans for all sorts of occasions.<br/><br/>The adventure ideas with a fantasy setting use names, creatures and places of the fantasy world of Glorantha (with permission of Greg Stafford), well known as the default setting of the role playing games &quot;RuneQuest&quot; and &quot;HeroQuest&quot;.  Even so, the adventure ideas should be easily adaptable for most other fantasy settings.<br/><br/>From the Back cover:<br/><br/>Inside you will find:<br/>Ten floor plans for all occasions.  Seven complex buildings, plus three inns in extra large size ready to use.<br/><br/>Each building comes with:<br/>- a sketch of the building to show your players<br/>- two sets of complete floor plans:<br/>one for the players, the other for the GM<br/>- an adventure idea in/around this building.<br/><br/>Suitable for ALL game systems.<br/><br/>"}, "68301": {"rpgdesigner": ["Robert Baldwin", "Jennifer Brandes", "Edward Carmien", "Graeme Davis", "Loren Dean", "Marcelo Figueroa", "Chris Hepler", "Spike Y.

Released in 2009 in Japan and 2010 in North America and PAL regions, it is the thirteenth installment in the Final Fantasy series. The game introduced a few innovations to the series: a fast-paced combat mechanic, a new system determining which abilities are developed for the characters called &quot;Crystarium&quot;, and a customizable &quot;Paradigm&quot; system to control which abilities are used by the characters. Final Fantasy XIII also includes elements from the previous games, such as summoned monsters, chocobos and airships.<br/><br/>The game takes place in the fictional floating world of Cocoon, whose government, the Sanctum, is ordering a purge on civilians who have supposedly come into contact with those from Pulse, the much-feared world below. Lightning, a former soldier from Cocoon, begins her fight against the government in order to save her sister, who has been branded a l'Cie&mdash;unwilling servants to the beings known as the fal'Cie, who maintain order on both Cocoon and Pulse&mdash;and thus has become an enemy of Cocoon. Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies, and together the group also become l'Cie after their encounter with a Pulse fal'Cie. Together, they rally against the Sanctum, while also trying to discover their &quot;Focus&quot; as l'Cie&mdash;the tasks they must complete before their time comes to an end.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Final_Fantasy_XIII,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "68320": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "British and Foreign Animals", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1820", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1003145_t.jpg", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Wm.

It was originally manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and was later licensed for production in the United States by the Midway division of Bally. Space Invaders is one of the earliest shooting games and the aim is to defeat waves of aliens with a laser cannon to earn as many points as possible. In designing the game, Nishikado drew inspiration from popular media: Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. To complete it, he had to design custom hardware and development tools.<br/><br/>Though simple by today's standards, with basic two-dimensional graphics, it was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry. When first released, Space Invaders was very successful and popular. Following its release, the game caused a temporary shortage of 100-yen coins in Japan, and by 2007 had earned Taito US$500 million in revenue. Guinness World Records ranks it the top arcade game.<br/><br/>The game has been the inspiration for other video games, re-released on numerous platforms, and led to several sequels. The 1980 Atari 2600 version quadrupled the system's sales and became the first &quot;killer app&quot; for video game consoles. Space Invaders has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows, and been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions. The pixelated enemy alien has become a media icon representing video games as a whole.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Space_Invaders,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Microbadges<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "68324": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "An historical game of England: The royal generalogical pastime of the sovereigns of England from Egbert to George 3rd", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1804", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: England"], "boardgameartist": ["S. l.

And while there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with such universes, I had something different in mind for Fires of Heaven &ndash; an interstellar civilization with enough size to provide plenty of adventure, yet not so vast the heroes will never see more than a tiny fraction of it. A young, expanding union of worlds with plenty of room for heroes to explore new worlds, make first contact with unknown alien races, and play key roles in the unfolding story if desired. I also wanted to keep technological and societal advances as plausible as possible, extrapolating from the modern-day save for nods to two science fiction mainstays &ndash; faster than light travel and artificial gravity. Finally, I set myself the challenge of basing the systems off current astronomical data on nearby stars and extrasolar worlds.<br/><br/>"}, "68330": {"rpgartist": ["Rick Becker", "Chris Carlson", "Leslie Cohen", "Liz Danforth", "Gene Day", "Lela Dowling", "Peter Laird"], "statistics": [], "name": "Sorcerer's Apprentice (Issue 6 - Spring 1980)", "rpgdesigner": ["Liz Danforth", "Larry DiTillio", "Thomas M.

It's the main strategy, hence the name of the game: Mentirosa (Spanish: liar).<br/><br/>EACH SET INCLUDES:<br/><br/>* 6 Mentirosa Player's Tubes<br/>    * 6 sets of casino-grade poker dice<br/>    * Loser Chips : These chips will help you keep track of the winners and losers.<br/>    * Mentirosa Professional or Travel storage case<br/>    * Instructions in English and Spanish.<br/><br/>2 to 20 Players (with extra sets) Ages 10 and up.<br/><br/><br/>How to play Mentirosa<br/><br/>In this version of liar's dice, the object of the game is to guess the number rolled, of any suit, among all the dice.<br/><br/>To begin the game, each player rolls a single die in open view of other players. The player<br/>with the highest suit starts the play. If a tie occurs, only those players in the tie roll again.<br/><br/>Players throw five poker dice into their tube. They look in their tube to see what they rolled.<br/><br/>A turn begins when the starting a player makes a call, for example three Jacks. This<br/>means they believe that there are at least three Jacks among all the dice in play.<br/><br/>The next player has two options:<br/><br/>1. Raise the call. This is done by, raising the suit called, raising the number of dice<br/>      called, or both. In this example, the next player could call three Queens, three<br/>      Kings, three Aces, or four of anything else. Any of these would be higher than the<br/>      three Jacks called. Or...<br/><br/>2. Challenge the call. When a player challenges a call, he or she does not believe<br/>      that the hand called, in this case three Jacks, exists among all the dice in play.<br/>      To challenge, a player raises their tube, revealing their hand and signaling to the<br/>      other players to do the same. At this point, the suit in play is counted.<br/><br/>In this example, if there are at least three Jacks among all the dice in play, the<br/>challenger receives a loser chip and a new turn begins. If there are less than three Jacks among the dice in play, the calling player receives a loser chip and a new turn begins.<br/><br/>The loser begins the next turn. There is no passing. Once a call is raised, it is the next player&rsquo;s turn and he or she has the same two options.The game continues in this manner, player after player, until a call is challenged.<br/><br/>Once a player receives 5 loser chips, they are out of the game. Last man standing wins!<br/><br/><br/>History of Mentirosa<br/><br/>The game of Mentirosa&reg; is known in many countries, by many different names. Its ancestry comes from a close relative, Cubilete, a game known to have been played as early as the Roman Era, especially in Spain.<br/><br/>Traveling to the Americas during the Spanish Empire, it became widely popular in Cuba and other parts of Latin America during the 19th and 20th centuries.<br/><br/>It is rumored that Mentirosa came about when the American GI's in Cuba combined the popular American game, Liar's Poker, with the cups and Spanish Poker dice used to play Cubilete.<br/><br/>Arriving in South Florida with exiled Cubans in the 1950s, Mentirosa&rsquo;s 21st century rebirth will give a new generation of players the opportunity to enjoy this classic game the way it was meant to be played.<br/><br/>Source: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.mentirosa.org' rel='nofollow'>www.mentirosa.org</a><br/><br/>"}, "68393": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Panzer", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1980", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic690161_t.jpg", "average": "3.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Gamecraft Ltd."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic690161.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Gamecraft First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Wargame", "World War II"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "User Summary:<br/>One of Gamecraft's Pocket Wars games.

By importing many of the decisions you made in the first game will have a small impact on the situation in the second.<br/><br/>No longer a Spectre agent working for the alien council, or a commander of a human System Alliance ship, Mass Effect 2 sees Shepard teaming up with the shadowy Cerberus corporation in order to investigate the disappearance of human colonies--and possibly prevent another assault from the Reapers. During your quest you will run into old contacts, as well as recruit new squad members.<br/><br/>Many criticisms of the first game have been addressed. The planet-exploring Mako has been replaced with a faster, nimbler hovercraft called the Hammerhead (while the missions containing the Hammerhead can only be accessed via downloadable content, they are free to anyone who purchased the game new). Secondary missions offer more variety and no longer occur in the same sterile, white-washed facilities that dominated the first game. Infinite ammo has been removed. Weapons now require thermal clips, and sub-machine guns and a variety of heavy weapons have been added to the game. Combat still occurs from a third person over-the-shoulder perspective, but each squad member can now only activate one biotic power at a time--and must wait for it to cooldown before activating another. This speeds up combat by lessening the amount of time spent pausing the game and issuing orders. You still earn points to spend on your squad members by leveling them up, but there are now fewer levels per power and fewer powers available. However, by collecting schematics scattered around the galaxy and researching them on your ship you can acquire new weapons or provide bonuses for your team.<br/><br/>From the game box:<br/><br/>Entire human colonies on many worlds are vanishing.

While occurring in real-time, combat can be switched to a turn-based mode using a re-implementation of the V.A.T.S. system from earlier games, utilizing action points and an auto-targeting system; V.A.T.S. can also be disabled, allowing combat to be played out FPS-style.<br/><br/>The game begins with the development of your character growing up in Vault 101.  This process controls your character generation, though the game allows you to override the selections determined by your choices.  Following up on the disappearance of your father, your character emerges outside the ruins of Washington D.C., where you are free to explore the various locales.  While the primary plot-line revolves around your quest for your father, many sub-quests offer insight into the world and development for your character.  As in previous games, your actions and conversations with various NPC's alter the way the you are perceived by the world around you, which can lead to additional side-quests.  Your actions also allow you to be joined by NPC companions, though you may only have one follower at any time.

Cyrodiil!  And it's up to you to save it (or ignore it if you'd rather).<br/>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the sequel to Morrowind and as was also true with the former, Oblivion allows you to do whatever you want, travel wherever you want, and play however you like. Play as an assassin, thief, wizard, alchemist, warrior, archer, or as any combination you desire! With ten races to choose from: four human, four elven, and two beast; the sheer number of different ways to play Oblivion are staggering.<br/><br/>As an RPG you create your character from scratch, picking their race, basic attributes, skills, and specializations, along with even more options. The main quest revolves around saving the land from daedra (demon-like beings) who keep appearing through Oblivion Gates (rift portals) and closing their access to the world of Nirn, which will be easier said than done.

Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.<br/><br/>7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.<br/><br/>In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.<br/><br/>Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["ADC Blackfire Czech edition", "Asmodee German second edition", "Asmodee Spanish edition", "Asterion Italian first edition", "Dutch only edition", "Galapagos Jogos Brazilian edition", "Hobby Japan edition", "Kaissa Greek first edition", "Kaissa Greek second edition", "Lautapelit.fi edition", "Lautapelit.fi second edition", "Lautapelit.fi third edition", "Polish edition", "Rebel.pl edition", "Repos Chinese edition 2013", "Repos EN/BG/KR/UA edition", "Repos EN/NL edition 2016", "Repos EN/NL/RO edition 2015", "Repos EN/NL/SP edition 2014", "Repos English 2015", "Repos English edition 2016", "Repos English first edition", "Repos English fourth edition", "Repos English second edition", "Repos English third edition", "Repos English third edition 2011 with 4 awards", "Repos French first edition", "Repos French second edition", "Repos German edition", "Repos German third edition 2011 with 5 awards", "Repos Hungarian edition", "Repos multilingual EN/DE/IT/NE/SP edition 2011", "Repos multilingual EN/DU/GR edition 2011", "Repos multilingual GR/HU/JP/KO edition 2011", "Repos Nordic edition", "Russian Edition"], "average": "7.8347", "name": "7 Wonders", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["154638", "110308", "111661", "92539", "83445", "133993", "164649", "140098", "138187", "134849", "131947", "132146", "164648", "164647"], "usersrated": "52289", "boardgameaccessory": ["7 Wonders: Art Pack", "7 Wonders: Metal Coins", "7 Wonders: Palace", "7 Wonders: Playmat", "7 Wonders: Repos Production Playmat"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["7 Wonders", "Tableau Building"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#45: Six-Player Six Pack;

With that said, never forget the game is a board game and as such has been modified to keep game play fun. The arena is based (again, loosely) on Rome&rsquo;s largest and oldest circus, Circus Maximus (called a circus because of the oval shape).<br/><br/>Attacks are allowed to simulate the whipping and bumping that occurred in a chariot race and the curves are more dangerous in the board game because they were in the real races.<br/><br/>Chariot Arena has two different playing boards to allow for better game play. The larger board comprised of four pages<br/>with smaller hexes was designed for a larger group of players and for those who enjoy longer more detailed game play. The<br/>smaller board comprised of two pages with larger hexes is designed to allow a smaller number of players to have more<br/>interaction in few laps and its charts are less complicated. Try both and play the one that best suits your style of play.<br/><br/>As each player takes their turn, they must first move their pawn 6 hexes. They then have the option to stay where they are or roll 2d6 (two six sided dice) and moving their pawn across the board one hex at a time the number of hexes shown on the dice. Movement can be forward left, forward right or forward. Moving a pawn backward on the track is not permitted. Only one<br/>pawn can occupy a hex at a time. If a pawn is in your way, you must move around it. The player also has the option to move<br/>the pawn less hexes than indicated on the dice (example: a player rolling 10 can move only 7 hexes if they wish). If a pawn&rsquo;s path is blocked by other pawns and it is impossible to move forward while moving the base 6 hexes, the player must choose which pawn to stop behind.

The most notable differences included marking all hidden passageways with white spots; replacing all the specialized status restoration items with a generic &quot;Remedy&quot; item that healed all status changes; and removing many character abilities from the battle system. Also, the secret &quot;developer team&quot; room that lies hidden in the full game was not accessible in Easy Type.<br/><br/>The American release: Final Fantasy II and the numbering<br/>As FFII and FFIII for the NES were never released in the US, the title of FFIV was changed to Final Fantasy II for the US release, years later causing confusion. Notably, the American release was in reality &quot;Final Fantasy IV Easy Type&quot;. Also, a short conversation scene in the starting town, where a dancer girl, being scared of the main character's Dark Knight appearance, throws off her dress and dances in her underwear, was deemed &quot;inappropriate&quot; and was removed. The dancer girl keeps her dress on in the US release. This caused internet rumours that the scene contained explicit nudity, which of course it didn't.<br/><br/>FFV also never got a US release, so FFVI, the last FF for the SNES, was named Final Fantasy III in the US.
