You must work around the weather and the extinction of natural resources as well as negotiate deals to protect your wives while you decide between monotheism or polytheism. In this tableau-building game, you'll send your population out to hunt native species of Greenland &mdash; but some might not come back. (Historically, the climate turned frigid and all but the Thule (Inuit) died out.)<br/><br/>In the game, play takes place over six phases; all players complete each phase in turn order, then the next phase starts. Each turn is one generation. In order:<br/><br/><br/>     Resolve events: Examples include elder deaths, animal migrations, feuds, or global cooling. If a trade ship arrives, an auction is held for its wares. <br/>     Assign hunters: Hunters are assigned to hunting grounds, resource gathering, colonizing the New World, raiding other tribes for wives or animals, or promotion to an elder.<br/>     Negotiate: Players can bribe others to peacefully withdraw hunters, including marrying them to their daughters. Players with a War Chief Elder can use hunters to attack others on the same card. The New World turns hostile if there are too many colonists.<br/>     Resolve hunting: Roll a die for each hunter and modify it for technologies and marriages. Success can result in gaining new hunters, resources, hand cards, wives, and/or technologies. Beware, as some animals can be confused by the prey-predator relationship and your hunters might not return. Some successes let your take cards from the central play area into your hand if within hand limit. <br/>     Maintain livestock: Pay to keep the animals you've already domesticated.<br/>     Take elder actions: Examples include invention, domestication, proselytization, and witch-burning. If you have no elders, you can convert to monotheism.<br/><br/><br/>Depending on each player's ending theistic worldview, he has a variable scoring based on successful hunts (polytheism) or resource gathering (monotheism).<br/><br/>LIVING RULES<br/><br/>Vassal module<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition", "Second edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "name": "Greenland", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Dice Rolling", "Simulation", "Worker Placement"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["185308"], "usersrated": "750", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "average": "7.1565", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 45 -- All The Pretty Shiny Things", "Episode 49 -- Whale Blubber and Automotive Upgrades", "Episode 53 -- The First Time Ever I Saw Your Meeple", "Episode 90 -- The Secret Life and Death of a Bowhead Whale", "ET98: Libert\u00e9, Homesteader\u00e9 y Groenlandi\u00e9", "Game Design and Greenland with Phil Eklund and Philipp Klarmann", "Low Player Count - Ep. 4 - Getting Ready for 'Sommer' Vacation", "Planeta de Juegos 29 - Lo que nos espera en Essen 2014", "TDT # 405 - Metagaming", "The Game Pit: Episode 31 - Essen 2014 Treasure Hunt Special (part 1)", "The Good The Board and The Gettin\u2019 Capped: Episode 85 \u201cInterview with Clay of Capstone Games\u201d"]}, "156502": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2226798.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mike Elliott", "Ethan Pasternack"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "14", "boardgamepublisher": ["WizKids"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2226798_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Science Fiction"], "description": "Victory is life!

For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.<br/><br/>This installment explores the draconic heritage, and characters whose mythic power comes from the majestic and terrifying creatures known as dragons. Whether you can trace your ancestry back to a powerful and terrible great wyrm, you act as a favored agent for such  creature, or you simply serve as a focal point for the powers of a draconic totem, this mythi heritage allows you to tap into the incredible power of dragons. The book includes 17 new mythic abilities, all of which are part of the draconic mythic heritage. In addition to timeless draconic powers like breath weapons, leathery wings, and scales that turn aside both blades and spells, these abilities also include such powers as the ability to sniff out treasures, empower draconic sorcerer blood, and grow more powerful with age, just as ancient dragons do.

These games have been integrated into a single app called Mind Games.  The games are based, in part, on concepts from cognitive psychology.  The Mind Games app will allow you to track your scores on each of the games.  The scoring system utilizes some concepts from standardized testing so that you can compare your scores with the scores of others and across games.<br/><br/>Description of Games:<br/><br/>Anticipation &ndash; This game allows you to practice your ability to think ahead and respond rapidly.  A series of images appear, and you must choose whether the two on the left match as quickly as possible.  In order to get the best score, you have to also pay attention to the images that are coming next.<br/><br/>Attention Training Game - This game is based on the flanker attention task.  A series of arrows will appear, and you must choose the direction that the middle arrow points, while ignoring the other arrows.<br/><br/>Divided Attention I - This game allows you to practice your divided attention skills and processing speed.  Two categories appear at the top of the screen and a group of images below.  Tap all the images that fall into the two categories as quickly as possible.  To get the best score, keep both categories in mind at the same time.<br/><br/>Face Memory Game &ndash; This game allows you to develop your ability to quickly learn and recognize faces.  Two lists of nine faces are briefly shown, and you must recognize the faces that were shown from faces that were not in the original list.<br/><br/>Math Star - This game will help you practice basic arithmetic skills (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); however, the main point of this game is not arithmetic skills.  The problems are easy, but you must focus and be quick to improve your score. Your score is based on the speed and accuracy of your performance.

Strictly speaking, this is not a traditional stand-alone &ldquo;module&rdquo; type adventure, but more of an outline of ideas and first steps for setting up Roman-era characters in a unique sandbox setting. Everything herein<br/>should be usable in any TSR edition of D&D or related retro-clone (Labyrinth Lord, Swords & Wizardry, OSRIC, and so on).<br/><br/>As you may also guess, XVI Troop was designed to be a quick facilitator to tacking on an ancient Roman feel to the basic D&amp;D rules while also folding in a bit of light-hearted fun, imported from some old TV situation comedies. Will this particular mash-up work at the game table? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out!<br/><br/>The basic idea for the setting is an out-of-the-way Roman fort on the northern British frontier. The site of VINDOLANDA, just south of Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall in what is now called Northumberland, contains an auxiliary fort, or castrum, filled with (mostly) locally recruited troops. What few true Roman citizens are present are figureheads, tolerated for the order they maintain. The time-frame is around 140&ndash;150 AD. The emperor Antoninus is busy trying to extend the bounds of the empire northward, and is building the Antonine Wall 100 miles to the north in Scotland. Vindolanda hasn&rsquo;t seen a full Roman legion &ndash; or the discipline that goes with it &ndash; in decades, but that all may be changing with the arrival of a new commanding officer.<br/><br/>"}, "156586": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Duncan Wright"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Redcap Manor", "playingtime": "25", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Rock-Paper-Scissors", "Secret Unit Deployment"], "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1966735_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Rustan Curman"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["The Game Crafter, LLC"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1966735.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Fantasy", "Horror"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "25", "description": "For almost three hundred years no Coldrum set foot in Mossdown, a largely self-imposed exile recently ended by my acquisition of the ruins of our ancestral home. With the restoration of Coldrum Manor ongoing, there has never been a better time to document its history, and it seems apt that it should be a Coldrum to relate the tale.<br/><br/>Coldrum Manor, more commonly known as the derisory &ldquo;Redcap Manor&rdquo;, was built atop Mossdown Hill, a site long associated with spirits and faeries. Legend speaks of a series of standing stones that once stood near the hill, and Roman records of the area describe pagan rites involving human sacrifice. The strategic location of Mossdown Hill has long been recognised, and several strongholds have been constructed at this site over the last one thousand years.<br/><br/>'Redcap Manor' draws from the most traditional tales of haunting in the British Isles, in which it was faeries, not ghosts, that kept people awake at night. In 'Redcap Manor', each player represents one of four Edwardian investigators sent to the titular mansion, to gather as much evidence for the uncanny as they can over three nights. To this end, the protagonists will use the recently-harnessed power of electromagnetism against the Fae.<br/><br/>'Redcap Manor' is an auction/bluffing card game, divided into three turns representing the three nights of terror. Each turn, the players select a number of Haunt cards from their hand, to be secretly shuffled into the Haunt deck for the next night. Haunt cards are divided into three types: Fae, Presence, and Influence cards, each of which is countered by a different Ward card. Each player then places one of their three Ward cards face-down, and takes it in turns to uncover the top-most Haunt card. Eight cards are revealed per turn, representing eight hours before the dawn. After revealing a Haunt card, a player may choose to flee the Manor, but may not re-enter that night. The Haunt card remains face-up, and may be taken by subsequent players, together with any newly revealed cards. Alternatively, the player may take the Haunt card(s) - any Haunt cards countered by their Ward are taken as evidence (victory points); however, if the top-most card is not countered by their Ward, it is taken as a curse. Each Haunt card (24 unique cards, one for each hour of each night) has its own effect, influencing how the game is played. The player must determine whether taking a curse is worth the opportunity to acquire more evidence.<br/><br/>At the end of the third night, the player with the most evidence points is the victor.<br/><br/>"}, "156587": {"poll": [], "name": "CivClicker", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Web Browser edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1964616.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Medieval"], "usersrated": "5", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Clicker / Incremental"], "videogameplatform": ["Web Browser"], "average": "5.46", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1964616_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In CivClicker, the player manages a civilization which begins as a hamlet.

Badly outgunned and outnumbered, the Imperial Ethiopian Army resisted for six months before its final collapse. Italian forces deployed tanks, aircraft and poison gas against the Ethiopian levies, who fought back with suicidal courage and little else.<br/><br/>Conquest of Ethiopia is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these battles. You do not need any other game to play any of its 40 scenarios. Design is by Lorenzo Striuli and Ottavio Ricchi, authors of our Fronte Russo supplement.<br/><br/>The Italian invaders rely heavily on colonial troops, long-service professionals recruited in Eritrea, Somalia and Libya. They also have Blackshirts, Carabinieri, elite Alpini mountain troops, tanks and a great deal of air power. And the Italian advantages continue: motor transport, much more artillery and armored cars.<br/><br/>Ethiopia&rsquo;s defenders include the elite Imperial Guard, and a number of regular battalions that are fairly good troops armed with modern weapons. Beyond that, things get a pretty bad for the Ethiopians pretty quickly. There are three distinct Ethiopian forces at play: the Imperial Regulars, the Imperial Levies (local forces loyal to the throne) and Provincial Levies (local forces loyal to their own leaders, usually a Ras or Duke). None of the levies are very well-armed.<br/><br/>The game includes eight semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with all others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too). Plus 517 playing pieces: smooth, scorchless, sootless laser-cut pieces, a joy just to hold in your hands.

War elephants will be bumping and crashing into each other on a tight course sending the others into a spin that will cost them crucial game points. Players must carefully balance a number of objectives, be quick with reactions, and recognize all of the scoring combinations to be able to beat their opponent. It is a game where experience counts for a great deal although a little bit of luck always helps. New and young players will be able to jump in fairly quickly and give the vets a run for their money.<br/><br/>War Elephant Racing uses Xhaos cards to spice up the race and increase the competitive action. Xhaos cards are special cards that call upon a special ability of an elephant of renown to give the players huge advantages to use against their competition. Special timing will provide the players with an edge over the other war elephant racers.<br/><br/>War Elephant Racing is played closely to Cribbage, each player is dealt war elephant racing cards and then must take turns laying one card at a time from their hand to attempt to get pairs, runs, and target numbers to score points. Each point allows the player to move their elephant an equal amount of points. Once each player has played all of the cards from their hand they then take turns adding up the different combinations of &quot;points&quot; in their hand to move their elephants. Players move around the tight track for six laps.<br/><br/>While players are moving their elephants if they land in a space that has another elephant they &quot;bump&quot; them. When a bump occurs the bump dice are rolled allowing the elephant to pass through, or send the bumped elephant in a spin, or send themselves in a spin costing valuable points.<br/><br/>War Elephant Racing also has &quot;Xhaos&quot; cards which allow them to make ranged attacks, powerful bumps, throw spectators in the path, and more. The xhaos cards are a great fun edge that each player will have to help them win the race. Almost all of the xhaos cards are named after famous elephants in history, and their effect in the game is related to their fame.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "12", "name": "War Elephant Racing", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Press Your Luck", "Trick-taking"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Cribbage", "Sports: Auto Racing"]}, "156637": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1965280.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Matt Anderson", "David Hanold"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Bryant Koshu", "Drake Tsui"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Drawn by Clouds", "Wyrd Miniatures"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1965280_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Collectible Components", "Science Fiction", "Video Game Theme"], "description": "Fall Schematic: The Cooperative Card Game is set in a world in which virtual identities pilot unique mechanized constructs called &quot;frames&quot; across a physical world.<br/><br/>Some of the more legendary frames of the world are equipped with powerful relics that they use to energize and deploy dormant lesser constructs called &quot;rigs&quot; to battlefields.

The other power-hungry drow families of Holoth may despise her but they know a true leader when they see one, and House Gullion has been revealed as the path to glory. With the entire Underworld in chaos and the Spider Goddess regularly communing with her chosen Matron, far greater dreams than mere regional conquest are within the grasp of the drow as Maelora prepares a grand dark elf army for victory! With mystical allies in place, other Underworld races beneath her heel or cowering behind fortified walls, and every drow ready to play their part when she gives the word, it is time for the PCs to make their move against the evil Matron Maelora and her increasing dominance, but how will they go about it?

Fierce economic competition between Britain and Spain has broken into open war: the War of Jenkin&rsquo;s Ear.<br/><br/>As His Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s naval commander-in-chief in the Caribbean, your duties have suddenly multiplied. Their Lordships at the Admiralty demand action. Parliament expects the speedy conquest of Spain&rsquo;s New World possessions &ndash; ALL of them &ndash;&nbsp;but is unwilling to supply men and ships. That would require the adoption of methods suitable only under a &lsquo;French Despotism&rsquo;. Before you utter them let it be known that your objections are unpatriotic and un-British. Meanwhile, the powerful Planters&rsquo; Lobby is insisting you make defending their islands your top priority, while the equally powerful Traders&lsquo; Lobby is demanding convoy protection and simultaneously accusing you of &lsquo;pressing&rsquo; merchant seamen into service aboard your ships.<br/> Or, can you honourably serve the great House of Bourbon, whose scions rule France and Spain? The English heretics have unjustly fabricated a war. They are jealous of Spain&rsquo;s greatness and desire her colonies for their own. For years they have paid lip service to the international laws of commerce while breaking those same laws at every opportunity. Of late, His Most Catholic Majesty had graciously agreed to accept arbitration for so-called &lsquo;wrongs&rsquo; done to British traders, waiving compensation for similar wrongs done to Spain. But when she offered payment, the English dogs slapped Spain&lsquo;s hand aside, saying it was not enough! This insult will not go unavenged. The King has ordered you to secure our trade routes and has issued letters of marque for the harrying of British merchantmen &ndash; let their own methods be used against them! In the fulness of time, our brother France has promised his support.<br/><br/>Control the seas and you control the fate of the New World. Whichever side you choose, glory and honour &ndash; and prizes galore &ndash; are yours for the taking. Provided you avoid court martial and disgrace.<br/><br/>Yellow Jack is a naval war game for two players, set during the years 1739-1743. It explores the roles of the navies of Britain, Spain, and France in the Caribbean. Scale is &ldquo;operational&rdquo; &ndash; that is, the playing pieces represent squadrons of as many as four ships, rather than individual men-o-war. Other counters represent leaders (good and bad), &ldquo;light&rdquo; forces such as frigates and galleys, and &ldquo;formations&rdquo; that allow you to concentrate your forces.<br/><br/>Tactical themes are eschewed in favour of operational issues: keeping your forces in fighting trim, being at the right place at the right time, &amp; dealing with a mounting list of instructions, orders, and unfilfillable mandates from your Government. Combat, though abstracted, takes into account leadership, the class and condition of your ships, and of course the Weather Gauge. In an Age of Sail, wind and water conditions are critical, even at the &ldquo;operational&rdquo; level. Movement uses a point-to-point system where costs change with the wind and you will often be unable to go where you desire. Actions are &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo;, but unlike many naval games, plotting is not required. Special features of Yellow Jack include the Hurricane Season, amphibious assaults and land campaigns, and the Yellow Jack itself &ndash; Yellow Fever.<br/><br/>Time Required: 3 hours for a Minor Scenario; 1 weekend for the Campaign Game. As a bonus, there are also scenarios for 1744-1748, when the Caribbean struggle became submerged in the greater War of the Austrian Succession; these allow an Extended Campaign covering 1739-1748.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>6 die cut counter sheets &ndash; 720 counters &ndash; including the naval forces of Britain, Spain, and France, plus Pirates (no Caribbean naval game is complete without Pirates). One of the counter sheets includes all the important naval leaders who participated in the War of the Austrian Succession; another consists of land units &ndash; all the regiments that fought in the Caribbean. There is also a sheet of generic markers.<br/><br/>37 wooden disks representing &ldquo;task forces&rdquo; (boxed game only; regular counters are also supplied to represent these items).<br/>48&rdquo; x 54&rdquo; map depicting the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and Carolinas coastline.<br/><br/>1 series rulebook, 1 exclusive rule book, 2 scenario/OOB books, 1 set of charts &amp; tables, historical commentary. 1 set of display cards.<br/><br/>"}, "156641": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Fiat: Diceless Roleplaying Compact", "rpgdesigner": ["Peter Kisner"], "rpgproducer": ["Peter Kisner"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1961528.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Fiat: Diceless Roleplaying Compact"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1961528_t.png", "description": "from the website:<br/><br/>...

Token systems are nothing groundbreaking in RPGs. Similar things have been used before to help skew the odds of a given outcome in games using dice.

That is to say, settings like Star Trek have elements which are inconsistent. Traditional RPGs often functions best in consistent set of setting presumptions. If a players fires his phaser at a ship and it is powerful enough to destroy it then he will reasonably expect it to happen every time he fires at a ship. However, in many stories there are exceptions that move the story forward.<br/><br/>To resolve this we need to look to cooperative role-playing systems. In this manner, a group of like minded people can use such a system to explore settings that do not follow a predictable set of rules. Plot exceptions can be agreed upon by the Group and not become a point of disruption in a game but rather an event to drive the story forward.<br/><br/>from DRAT System:<br/>DRAT System stands for Dice-less Role-playing And Tactics System. The goal of this system is to provide the tools for a cooperative storytelling experience. If everyone in the group is not committed to telling a story, the game will not work.

The game is played over 3 rounds (periods). The players should ideally play facing each other and have access to a 6-card inverted pyramid game area.<br/><br/>Each game area consists of 3 rows. The row closest to the player represents the goalkeeper. A single card is placed in this row. The second row holds two cards, representing defenders. The third, and final row, holds three cards, representing the forwards on the team. All cards are placed face up in a portrait orientation except the goalkeeper which is placed face down in a landscape orientation.<br/><br/>The first player, determined in whatever fashion the players desire, shuffles the deck and secretly looks at the top card. He can choose to place this card in any open position in his own play area. Once placed, the card cannot be moved. Once all six spots are filled, the deck is passed to the opponent who fills his own six spots in like manner.<br/><br/>Players take turns advancing on their opponent. Each turn begins with the player flipping over the top card of the deck and comparing it to his opponent's line of forwards. If the card matches or beats another card in value, both cards are discarded and the player is considered having advanced past that hockey player. If multiple cards meet the criteria, the player chooses which route to take.<br/><br/>There is a strategic element when deciding which route to take when advancing on your opponent. With your first card, you compare against the three forwards. Once you have overcome a forward, your options for advancement may be limited. At no point are you allowed to skip another card in order to reach a more favorable card.<br/><br/>Let's say that you use your first card to overtake the center forward with your first card &mdash; you now have clear line of sight to both remaining forwards and the two defenders, but the goal is still blocked. If, on the other hand, you advanced past the left side forward, only the center forward and left defender are &quot;open&quot; to you.<br/><br/>Once the goal is &quot;open&quot;, you are free to attempt to score at any point. You simply announce that you will shoot instead of taking on a hockey player. Your card is compared to the value of the goalkeeper. If your card is <i>higher</i> in value, you have scored a goal. Regardless, both cards are discarded as usual.<br/><br/>Whether a goal is successfully scored or not, it is now your opponents turn. Play also switches if you fail to successfully overtake enough players to clear an open path to your opponent's goal.<br/><br/>Your opponent will begin his turn by first filling any open spots as was done when the game began. He then takes his turn as normal.<br/><br/>Special Rule: When only one card is left in the deck, a player may, on his turn, assuming his team slots are filled, attempt a shot on goal regardless of whether an open path exists or not.<br/><br/>Once the deck is exhausted, the period is considered having ended. All cards are gathered up, play switches to the next player who shuffles and drafts his team as was done at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>Once three periods have been played, the player with the most goals is declared the winner.

The dealer tries to guess how many answered 'Yes' or 'No', and if they guess correctly, they keep the question card. If not the dealer decides which stories they want to hear why people answered 'Yes' or 'No'. If the dealer wants to hear the 'Yes' stories and you as a player answered yes, you can choose to tell the story to win the card, or keep quiet and remain anonymous. If there are more than one 'Yes' cards, then multiple people can tell their stories and the dealer decides which story wins.

In time, the Church of Law and Order suppressed the Druunic teachings, and the ancient holy sites were lost, forgotten, or converted to other uses.<br/><br/>One such former site is located in the capital city of Dolmvay in the center of a small neighborhood known as Whiteoak Square. This neighborhood has recently been experiencing a strange phenomenon: At night, small dancing lights have been seen floating throughout the neighborhood. The residents were afraid of this sorcery at first, however, the lights seem to exude a feeling of peace and contentment, and the locals have grown used to them.<br/><br/>How it Started<br/><br/>A few weeks ago, a butcher named Walton Brand was clearing out his cellar when he stumbled upon a secret underground passage that led to an ancient Druun hall. This hall was filled with lost relics, arcane lore, and forgotten treasures of the Druun.<br/><br/>Walton told his friends, Loomis the Baker and the chandler Stefan of Walsbury, and the three men began sneaking away from their wives at night to dress in Druun finery and pretend to be men of wealth. A harlot named Red Kirsten was hired to attend them as they drank, feasted, and cavorted in the sacred hall.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to the revelers, the Druun hall still retained some of its magical powers and their merriment awakened the ancient guardian spirits of the grove. These creatures, known as faerlings, are the lights that have been seen dancing throughout the neighborhood. The faerlings were given life by the revelers' glee, and they project that joy and happiness onto the other residents of the neighborhood. This glee, however, is about to turn to horror. . .<br/><br/>Oak Grove Whispers is a Labyrinth Lord adventure designed for 3-6 characters of 1st-3rd levels (about 10 levels total). The adventure is broken up into three chapters that take place in a small neighborhood located in the capital city of Dolmvay (the Labyrinth Lord is free to substitute any medium- to large-sized city from his own campaign world).<br/><br/>Oak Grove Whispers involves a mixture of roleplaying, investigation, and dungeon crawling, so a diverse range of classes is recommended. As the adventure is set in a civilized city, the characters must also be careful their interaction with NPCs does not land them on the wrong side of the law.<br/><br/>"}, "156687": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jobe Bittman"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "The One Who Watches From Below", "rpgartist": ["Tom Galambos", "Friedrich A.

These rare, exotic, and above all forbidden spells are few and far between, but the immense opportunity that they provide to those who find a way to claim them is well worth the risks. And the risks are many: not only is there a risk that any practitioner who takes up such a spell will be hunted for dabbling in forbidden and &ldquo;black&rdquo; magic, but the spells themselves invite danger, and by casting them, the mage opens himself up for the possibility of losing control, and causing a terrible calamity.<br/><br/>Still, such forbidden magic is highly desirable to spellcasters of every sort, because despite all of that, or perhaps because of it, these spells contain more power than those of the average sorcerer or wizard. Destroy your enemies with powerful killing spells like power word massacre and damnation, or take up more defensive magic, like mirror of the witch, which surrounds the caster with nigh-impenetrable mirrors that protect her from all forms of attack. Alternatively, cast dance of demons, and laugh as your victims destroy themselves and each other by enacting a vrock&rsquo;s dance of ruin. Strip virtually any target of spellcasting ability with demise of the warlock, or force your victims to kill themselves with proclamation of suicide.<br/><br/>The Book of Forbidden Magic includes 47 new spells with the forbidden descriptor. These spells are more powerful than traditional spells, but come with a drawback in the form of profane points, and the possibility that each time one is cast, they may cause a horrible calamity to befall the caster. The book also contains detailed rules governing profane points and calamities, including nearly 50 different specific types of potential calamities, from horrible magical backlash of various sorts to accidental planar rifts of all kinds and numerous sorts of mental intrusion by otherworldly entities. If you want spellcasting in your game to be more exciting, or are looking for more options for your character and enjoy taking risks and dabbling with powers man was not meant to know, look no further than The Book of Forbidden Magic.<br/><br/>"}, "156692": {"rpgartist": ["Joseph J.

If the hexes are 5 miles across, then it's about 175 miles by 180 miles - or 31,500 square miles, a heavily forested inland area that's around the size of South Carolina or the Czech Republic. Here is the description of this world:<br/><br/>&quot;The so-called Wilderness really consists of unexplored land, cities and castles, not to mention the area immediately surrounding the castle (ruined or otherwise) which housed the dungeons.&quot;<br/><br/>If you actually read the wilderness description in OD&D volume 3: The Underworld & Wilderness Adventures, it turns out that the implied details of the setting are weird. Fighters in castles demand to be jousted, magic-users cast Geas and send them out after treasure, clerics demand a tithe or send the characters on a Quest.<br/><br/>But the real weirdness, and this was apparently confirmed in Gary Gygax's campaigns, is what is there when you start wandering about the wilderness. Mountains are haunted by cavemen and necromancers; deserts are home of nomads and dervishes. The &quot;Optional&quot; animal listings turns swampland into the Mesozoic Era - rather than alligators and snakes it is full of tyrannosaurs and triceratops. Arid plains are Barsoomian, with banths, thoats, calots and the lot, while mountains are outright paleolithic, peopled by mammoths, titanotheres, mastodons, and sabre-tooth cats. Gygax confirms this:<br/><br/>&quot;When I was using the pre-World of Greyhawk map for my world setting, the West Coast of North America was the Pleistocene<br/>region inhabited by savage cavemen and their contemporary fauna.&quot;<br/><br/>... more and more I'm finding that I like the idea of this setting. It's radically different from, say, the more comfortable World of Greyhawk, or most other fantastic realms; it's a true outland, where civilization hangs on by a thread. It leaves open terrific possibilities; the nomads, dervishes, cavemen, and berserkers all live in the world around towns; so do centaurs and pixies and minotaurs. I want to start to go into what the oddities of this setting are, and how they fit; it's a good match for the concept of &quot;Demon-Haunted Lands,&quot; which I'm seeing more and more as a way to make something unique out of this setting.<br/><br/>user summary:<br/>An edited collection of essays on various aspects of the implied OD&amp;D setting based upon the map from Avalon Hill's Outdoor Survival boardgame, which was part of the recommended additional equipment for the original Dungeons & Dragons.

Sometimes dangerous, sometimes delightful, sometimes both intertwined in a passionate embrace. At least, that is what we want to happen when we bring the fey into a campaign: to create an atmosphere of absolute wonder and mystery. All too often, however, that magical vision in our minds just doesn't come through, and the fey end up as just another monster with a veneer of pretension.<br/><br/>Faerie Mysteries changes all of that with an innovative system of crossing over the warped reality where the influence of the fey makes itself known in the world. These fey impulses vary from rumors that are mostly atmospheric and sensory effects to ripples that disrupt and disturb creatures and objects to full-fledged ruptures that bring rapid and radical change both beautiful and bizarre. This system does for the fey what haunts do for undead, showing how their influence is not limited to simple encounters. That said, Faerie Mysteries also provides a wealth of sample encounters and events focused on the fey and the strange circumstances that may surround a meeting with them or may follow in their wake, and also deals with making subtle variations of existing non-fey creatures to provide unexpected challenges for creatures who think they know it all when it comes to fighting the fey.<br/><br/>Brought to you from the magical minds at Legendary Games, Faerie Mysteries also serves as a sequel to Faerie Passions, providing a rich mechanical supplement to the role-playing concepts and player options presented there. If you're running a campaign where the fey play a significant role, or even if you just want to inject a bit of magical mystery into your game, download this 29-page supplement today and Make Your Game Legendary!<br/><br/>"}, "156737": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1963897.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Kevin Wilson"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["menton3"], "boardgamepublisher": ["IDW Games", "Pandasaurus Games"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1963897_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Bluffing", "Movies / TV / Radio theme", "Science Fiction"], "description": "In The X-Files, players take on the role of Mulder, Scully, and the X-Files team as they work to uncover global conspiracies and threats while going up against various members of the Syndicate.

It's what happens when you mix Camelot with a spoonful of Torchwood, add a pinch of cyberpunk, a dash of Joss Whedon's Angel, and a sprinkling of Shadowrun. If you enjoy these, you're going to love Corporia.<br/><br/>From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Corporia is a tabletop role-playing game of genre-bending fiction and futuristic urban fantasy. Play as one of the reborn Knights of the Round Table or one of their supernaturally powered allies, fighting an invisible war against the rise of monsters, magicks, and the powerful mega-corporations that want to control it all.<br/><br/>In the near future&hellip;<br/><br/>Corporations control the world, and Order is the rule of the day. New technologies clean the evironment and raise glittering skyscrapers in outwardly utopian cities, but at the cost of personal freedoms and liberties. It is surely the time foretold in legend, when the Knights of the Round Table would return in the hour of mankind&rsquo;s greatest need.<br/><br/>Yet the Knights are scattered, their memories fragmented, and King Arthur nowhere to be found. Worse, their return breached the barriers of reality, opening portals to the dimensions of Chaos. Now every day brings new horrors as magical anomalies bestow either superhuman abilities or horrible mutations on the populace, monsters spawn in the dark places, spirits return as electronic geists, and software becomes self-aware. The corporations outwardly dismiss these outbreaks as effects of cosmic radiation (aka &sbquo;the Flux&lsquo;) even while waging hidden wars to master this new energy source. Only you and your allies stand for justice in the battle between corporate Order and magical Chaos.<br/><br/>Fortunately, you have powerful benefactors - Sir Lancelot (awakened as a megacorp CEO) and his allies: Sir Percival, the sorceress Nimue, and the artificial intelligence known as M.E.R.L.I.N. As a member of the Knightwatch, Lancelot&rsquo;s secret special operations team, you battle magical monstrosities and augmented humans, dive into living computer networks, infiltrate rival mega-corporations, and more.

At the end of the game, the player with the most treasure wins!<br/> THE DECK<br/>80 Kitten Cards: Ten each of ranks 1-7 and ten of rank 9 (There is no rank 8 in Kombat Kittens.) Each card has treasure value from 1 to 4.<br/>Five Dog Cards: Each Dog card has a treasure value of 5. Dogs do not have a rank.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Remove all Dog cards from the deck and deal each player five Kitten cards.<br/> For two players: Deal out three Kitten cards face up in the center of the table - these are the Recruit cards. Add three Dog cards to the remaining deck, each \u2153 of the way through the deck, with the last on the bottom. This is the Draw pile. Place it in the center of the table.<br/> For three to five Players: Deal out one Kitten card face up in the center of the table - this is the Recruit card. Add two Dog cards to the remaining deck, one at the center, and one on the bottom. This is the Draw pile. Place it in the center of the table.<br/> The player with the most realistic &ldquo;meow&rdquo; goes first.<br/><br/>TAKING TURNS<br/>On each turn, the player can either:<br/>1) Draw a card from the Draw pile. (If they have less than seven cards in their hand.)<br/>or<br/>2) Take a Recruit card and replace it with a card from their hand.<br/>or<br/>3) Battle another player: do this by declaring which player you wish to battle.<br/> We recommend passing a turn token (coin, salt shaker, stuffed mouse, etc.) around the table as you play this game. It is always okay to ask how many cards another player has.<br/><br/>Battles<br/>In a battle, both players attempt to make the best three card set from the cards in their hand.  <br/> To indicate they are ready to battle, each player holds their first card face down over the table. When both players are ready, they reveal their cards simultaneously. They repeat this process until three cards have been played (unless a player forfeits, as described below.) After the third card, the best hand is determined and the winner chooses their treasure (see below).<br/><br/>DETERMINING THE WINNER OF A BATTLE<br/>The winner is the player with the best hand based on the hierarchy below, from high to low. If two hands of the same type are played, the one with the highest rank wins.<br/>Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank. Example: 4,4,4 beats 2,2,2 and all straights, pairs and high card hands.<br/>Three Card Straight: Three cards of adjacent rank. Example: 4,5,6 beats 2,3,4 and all pairs and high card hands.<br/>Pair: Two cards of matching rank, plus one other card. For matching pairs, the one with the highest 3rd card wins. Example: 6,6,5 beats 6,6,3 or 4,4,7 and any high card hand.<br/>High Card Hand: A hand without a straight and no pairs. Example: 7,4,3 beats 6,5,2.<br/><br/>TIES<br/>If there is a tie, all players involved in the tied battle discard the played cards and take the number of cards they played from the draw pile instead of drawing up to five cards. No treasure is taken in a tied battle.<br/><br/>CAPTURING TREASURE<br/>At the end of battle, the winning player captures Treasure from the losing player(s) as follows:<br/> Three to Five Player Game: The winner may now take either one card from the losing player&rsquo;s played cards or the lowest value treasure from the losing player&rsquo;s captured treasure. If there are multiple lowest value cards, the winner chooses whichever of these they want.<br/> Two Player Game: The winner takes one of the loser&rsquo;s played cards - they cannot take captured treasure.<br/><br/>AFTER A BATTLE<br/>Once battle is resolved, all uncaptured cards that were played are put into a discard pile, which we call the Litter Box. Then,  all players who participated who have fewer than five cards left, draw new cards until they have a total of five in their hand.<br/> All captured cards are placed face up in front of the player who captured them, so that their treasure value and suit are visible to all. Additionally, if a player forfeited (see below), they draw an extra card now. If a battle ended in a tie, then each of the players in the battle (primary and helper) draw the number of cards they played (three or one).<br/><br/>HELPING<br/>Once a battle has been announced, but before the first card is played, each player involved in the battle may ask for help. If Player B agrees to help Player A, then Player B will play a single card at the end of the battle, after Player A has played their three cards. In a four or five person game, each side in a battle may ask for and receive help. If both sides have a helper, then each helper reveals their card simultaneously after the two main combatants have shown all three cards.<br/><br/>After all cards are played, each side makes their best three card hand out of the four cards available.<br/><br/>Taking treasure: In a helper battle, two cards are taken from the loser. The main combatant on the winning side chooses one card from the played cards (all four cards, if the losing side had a helper) and one card from the main losing combatant&rsquo;s captured treasure. If the main combatant on the losing side has no captured treasure, then the winning side takes two cards from the cards played. Once they&rsquo;ve taken treasure, the winner can choose to give one of those cards to the player who helped them.<br/> Example: Kim announces she will battle Josh. Josh and Kim both ask for help. Mike agrees to help Kim, and Vivian agrees to help Josh. Kim and Josh then simultaneously reveal three cards from their hand in sequence. Mike and Vivian then both reveal a card from their hand. Kim&rsquo;s side ends up with 5,5,5,7 and Josh&rsquo;s side ends with 4,5,6,7. Kim&rsquo;s side wins, because she has three 5&rsquo;s which beats Josh&rsquo;s hand of 5,6,7.<br/> Kim then takes one card from Josh&rsquo;s captured treasure, and one of the four cards played (one of the 4,5, 6 or 7).  Although she could add both cards to her own treasure, she gives Mike one of the two as a reward for helping her.<br/><br/>FORFEITING<br/>Either of the main combatants in a battle may forfeit after playing their first or second card. Players who are receiving help can forfeit as well, but even if they do, the helper must play a card. Cards played by the forfeiting player or their helper are subject to being taken by the winner, just as in any other battle.<br/> If a player forfeits, they are allowed to take an additional card from the Draw Pile after the battle. If they are left with fewer than five cards at the end of battle, they first draw until they have five cards then take their additional card. Helpers on the forfeiting side may not take an additional card. They only take new cards if they have less than five in their hand at the end of battle.<br/><br/>DOGFIGHTS<br/>If at any point during play a player draws a Dog card from the deck, they immediately place it face up in the center of the table and a Dogfight commences. (Before the Dogfight, the player who drew the Dog draws a new card and any other players who were in mid-draw should finish drawing.)<br/> Players must play at least one card in the Dogfight, but they may forfeit after playing their first or second card. The winner of the Dogfight takes the Dog card and places it face up in front of them in their captured treasure. As in normal battle, all players select a card and hold it face down over the table, then reveal their cards at once. Unlike a normal battle, players may not ask for help.<br/> The Dogfight ends when either a) all players but one have forfeited, or b) all players who are still in the Dogfight have played three cards. In the case of Ties, the Dog is discarded, and all players who played three cards take three cards from the draw pile.<br/> As with normal battle, any players who forfeit the Dogfight battle draw an extra card at the end of the battle and all players who have fewer than five cards draw until they have five.<br/><br/>REACHING THE END OF THE DECK<br/>Two Players: At the end of the first deck, there will be a single Dogfight (the bottom card is always a Dog) and then the game is over.<br/> Three to Five Players: At the end of the first deck, after the Dogfight, take all the discarded cards from the Litter Box and reshuffle them. Then add the last three Dogs to this deck, each card roughly \u2153 of the way through the deck with the last Dog on the bottom of the deck. When you reach the end of the second deck there will be one final Dogfight and then the game is over.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>Two players: The game ends after the Dogfight at the end of the first deck.<br/>Three to Five players: The game ends after the Dogfight at the end of the second deck.<br/> Note: If any player has fewer than five cards or needs to draw cards due to a previous battle, then shuffle the discards from the Litter Box and draw cards before the final Dogfight.<br/><br/>DETERMINING A WINNER<br/>At the end of the game, each player adds up the treasure value of all cards in their captured treasure (the ones face up in front of them) and adds any Suit Bonuses (as described below). The player with the highest total wins! They should be patted on the head and given a treat.<br/><br/>SUIT BONUSES<br/>A player who has four or more treasure cards of the same suit receives a 10 point bonus at the end of the game.

Each player equips fleets with escort ships and upgrades and uses them to control star systems for VPs. Diplomatic leverage, cunning, and brute force will determine the victor.<br/><br/>Each round in Fleets: The Pleiad Conflict consists of six phases:<br/><br/>1) Player order. Every round has a new randomized player order. Being first has its pros and cons, so does being last.<br/><br/>2) Build. The players take turn buying new fleets, escort ships, and upgrades, using their megacredits. The fleets each consist of a flagship and space for some combinations of escort ships and upgrade cards. Which fleet you choose and how you develop it will determine its strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>3) Deployment. The players place their fleets at the different systems they want to control.<br/><br/>4) Diplomacy. Players take turns using diplomatic actions. There are 2 basic actions: A) Use 2 diplomatic points to retreat your fleet from the board. B) Use 6 diplomatic points to retreat an opposing fleet from a system where you have a fleet. There are also diplomatic actions on some fleets, systems, and action cards.<br/><br/>5) Battle. At every system with more than one fleet there will be a battle where every ship gets to shoot once. Each fleet has different initiative numbers for its ships, describing when they get to act. Late ships risk being shot down before they have a chance to fire. During battle, players can also use battle actions on action cards, upgrade cards, fleets, and escort ships. Most battle actions cost energy from the fleet. If a flagship is destroyed, its owner must immediately retreat all surviving escort ships from that battle and discard the fleet.<br/><br/>6) Reward. Players get 1 VP for each system they have to themselves (The first player to reach 7 VP is the winner.). Then each fleet gets energy from its reactor and resources from the system where they are located. Then each player gets 2 diplomatic points, 6 megacredits, and an action card, and then the next round can begin.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "6.95488", "name": "Fleets: The Pleiad Conflict", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["181320"], "usersrated": "82", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "156751": {"poll": [], "name": "Monopoly Junior: Planes", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Trading"], "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Celebrities: Walt Disney", "Monopoly"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2427066_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Hasbro", "Winning Moves Australia Pty Ltd", "Winning Moves UK Ltd."], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2427066.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Economic"], "age": "5", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "A version of Monopoly Junior based on the Disney movie Planes.

The game is worth buying at least for the illustrations on the cards: very vividly depicted representatives of the Russian criminal world.<br/>Also the cards have classical card suits on them. So you can play classical card games with one of the decks, if you want to.<br/><br/>The game consists of two decks - fighters and property. Each card has a toughness value. If the toughness of the fighter is higher than the toughness of the property, he can capture it and become it's guard. The owner of that fighter becomes the owner of the property.

Even as you lead your bravest warriors into battle, you must plan for the future, establishing a presence on planets before the tides of war consume them in blood and fire. You must conquer the Traxis sector by strength of arms for in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.<br/><br/>Warhammer 40,000: Conquest introduces seven distinct factions: Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, Chaos, Dark Eldar, Eldar, and Tau. Each of these factions possesses a unique flavor and style of play, and an alignment wheel introduces the possibility of forming an alliance between two factions.<br/><br/>At the start of play, the Traxis sector lies open before you, with planets awaiting the tramp of armies on the road to war. Each round begins with you and your opponent preparing for battle. Planet cards are arranged in a row between the players at the beginning of the game, and the planet farthest to the left of the starting player is the first planet. Each round, you or your opponent will clash at the first planet, and the victor will capture the first planet.<br/><br/>Capturing planets is your ultimate goal. Some planets possess essential materials necessary for the armies of the 41st millennium. Others offer strategic advantages to those who hold them, while yet others are home to great technological wealth. Each of the planet cards possesses one or more symbols in the upper left hand corner, designating that planet's assets. These symbols grant no abilities by themselves, but the first player to collect three planets sharing a common symbol dominates the sector and wins the game.<br/><br/>Your warlord grants powerful special abilities, determines your starting resources and hand size, and serves as a vital part of your army, so you'll want to build your deck around your warlord to take full advantage of his strengths &mdash; and cover his weaknesses, as defeating the opponent's warlord is another way to victory.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese First Edition", "English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish edition", "Spanish First edition"], "average": "7.48467", "name": "Warhammer 40,000: Conquest", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": ["203745", "179174", "180571", "177476", "170276", "164680", "194717", "190019", "205381", "197581", "194718", "174560", "162355", "163340", "168677", "202240", "196383", "182377", "189308", "166897"], "usersrated": "2052", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Customizable Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["CCGs (Collectible Card Games)", "Living Card Game", "Warhammer 40,000 Card Games", "Warhammer 40,000: Conquest LCG"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Adeptus Podcastus - Episode 1", "Adeptus Podcastus - Episode 2", "Adeptus Podcastus - Episode 3", "Adeptus Podcastus - Episode 4", "Adeptus Podcastus - Episode 5 \" The Power Of Chaos\"", "Conquering the Galaxy With An LCG: Our Warhammer: Conquest Review", "Episode 1 \u2013 Space Wolves Inbound", "Episode 10", "Episode 11 - \"spoiler Alert\"", "Episode 11: Speed-dating in a Competitive Meta", "Episode 12 \"loyal=Good\"", "Episode 12: Full.

Animals shun it. Adventurers share whispered rumors about it over the campfire's last embers. It is Castle Farkinwald. Built long ago by an intensely perverse wizard named Farkinwald the Fantastic, the castle that bears his name occupies a lonely mountain range in the middle of an uninhabited plain. Farkinwald never stirs from his lair giving rise to the notion every ten years or so that he&rsquo;s finally passed away, leaving his piles of incalculable wealth unattended. Adventurers, braggarts and drunks, fired by visions of becoming as wealthy as sultans, invariably risk everything to explore the truth of these rumors, never to return. The only question that matters however is: will *you* dare to brave the forlorn fastnesses of Castle Farkinwald?<br/><br/>This dungeon is supposed to kill you. Don't be discouraged by dying early, often and gruesomely. It's not intended to be fair; sometimes you will be killed simply for taking the wrong Hindrances or Edges. That's the way Farkinwald rolls.<br/><br/>Castle Farkinwald is intended to work with whatever swords-and-sorcery setting you'd like to run. Feel free to adapt it as you need to so that it will fit within your campaign of choice.<br/><br/>Why even attempt a dungeon like this? Well, it was designed as a one-shot so if you're just looking for something ridiculous to play with your gaming buddies for a night, this'll give you some laughs. If you're of a more serious frame of mind, you can play this tournament style and see who amasses the most points by the end of the night. If your campaign allows for easy resurrection magic, you could place this dungeon in your world as a sort of &quot;sports dungeon&quot; that adventurers go through while fans watch via crystal balls and other divination magic.<br/><br/>"}, "156778": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "statistics": [], "name": "Mustache Force", "rpgdesigner": ["Collin Terrell"], "rpgproducer": ["Collin Terrell"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1964994.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["Version 1.0 PDF"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Comedy / Satire", "Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)", "Modern (Pop Culture)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1964994_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>Elevator Pitch:<br/>Tom Selleck.

One that is playable from the Soviet side and one from the German point of view. The campaigns are story driven, using graphic novel-type panels to propel the plot. A turn-based game, Heroes of Stalingrad retains Lock 'n Load's engaging impulse system while adding features, such as flanking fire, hidden units, and residual machine gun fire, that would just be too fiddly for the boardgame.<br/><br/>In each campaign gamers will not only need their tactical wits as the fight company-sized battles in, and on the approaches to, Stalingrad, but will also need to manage their troops in the campaign interface. It is in the campaign interface that they decide who to take into to battle, how to spend their precious resource points, and whether to lead a tank-heavy force, vulnerable to enemy infantry in the streets of Stalingrade, or a less mobile, infantry only, contingent.<br/><br/>Heroes of Stalingrad ships with 15 stand alone missions for those who want to jump right in to the fighting. There are bridge seizures, Partisan ambushes, and even a reprisal of several of the scenarios from Lock 'n Load Publishing's fast-selling Not One Step Back.<br/><br/>Fully integrated multiplayer support means easy player matching, no extra configuration required and seamless head to head play with 9 balanced multiplayer scenarios.<br/><br/>As you have come to expect from Lock &lsquo;n Load Publishing, the art is superb. David Julien, Marc von Martial, Nicolas Eskubi, Gabriel Gendron, Guillaume Ries and Pete Abrams have combined to make soldiers, tanks, and maps that pull you into the conflict and won&rsquo;t let go. An engaging soundtrack written and performed by Jeff Edwards adds to the immersion.

There are 21 different animals, including &quot;Man,&quot; and they range from the lowly mosquito to the mighty Lion.<br/><br/>The game is played in days and each day, players take turns either asking another player a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; question (in a quest to learn the identity of that player's animal) or attacking another player's animal (if they believe their animal is stronger that day). When an attack occurs, the player with the more powerful animal ON THAT DAY wins the attack and stays in the game. The losing animal is revealed to all and the player with that animal is out of the game. The game continues until.  only one player/animal remains and is declared King of the Jungle.<br/><br/>While each animal has a usual strength (i.e., the Frog (3), the Crocodile (12), the Lion (20)), each day comes with a different condition (i.e., flood, monsoon, drought, Beautiful Day). The condition of a day can change the strength of some of the animals. For example, while the Lion (20) on most days is more powerful than most animals when the jungle is flooded, the strength of the Crocodile rises to 21 and on this day can defeat the Lion. Learning which player has which animal, how to keep the identity of your animal a secret,and when to attack another player's animal are all key components to becoming King.<br/><br/>To enhance the strategic element, play with Advantage Cards (included).

As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot;, the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?<br/><br/>Black Orchestra begins with each player choosing an historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).<br/><br/>But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.<br/><br/>On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions &mdash; at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling &quot;Conspire&quot; action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.<br/><br/>After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.<br/><br/>To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator &amp; fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of &quot;Target&quot; symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any &quot;Eagles&quot; rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.<br/><br/>Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of it's cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English second edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.58908", "name": "Black Orchestra", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Point to Point Movement", "Press Your Luck", "Set Collection", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["213777", "214319"], "usersrated": "578", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["#24: The HYPE Episode!

The heroes also receive powerful new assets in Manor of Ravens, gaining access to two new heroes as well as new hero classes for Warriors and Scouts.<br/><br/>A new lieutenant also enters the scene as the heroes attempt to investigate the manor house. Skarn is a magical construct, composed of pieces of the manor house and possessed of limitless potential. If Skarn is not stopped, he could continue to grow and eventually overwhelm the world.

It has an endless number of variations, so the summary below will deal with the most common rules in use today.<br/><br/>Chicago is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The object of the game is to score points by having the best poker hand. Each poker hand is assigned a point value (p), as follows:<br/><br/>1p &mdash; One Pair: Two cards of the same rank (e.g.: A, 10, 10, 6, 2).<br/>2p &mdash; Two Pair: Two pairs of different ranks (e.g.: K, K, J, 4, 4).<br/>3p &mdash; Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank (e.g.: Q, Q, Q, 9, 6).<br/>4p &mdash; Straight: Five cards in rank sequence (e.g.: J, 10, 9, 8, 7).<br/>5p &mdash; Flush: Five cards of the same suit (e.g.: A, J, 10, 7, 3; all diamonds).<br/>6p &mdash; Full House: Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (e.g.: Q, Q, Q, 9, 9). <br/>7p &mdash; Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same rank (e.g.: J, J, J, J, 8).<br/>9p &mdash; Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (e.g.: J, 10, 9, 8, 7; all diamonds).<br/><br/>Points are also awarded for taking the last trick of each round (5 points), or for scoring a &quot;Chicago&quot; by taking all five tricks of the round (15 or 25 points, must be declared by calling &quot;Chicago&quot; before any trick is played).<br/><br/>The first player to reach a pre-determined number of points (typically 50, 52, or 100) wins the game.<br/><br/>Common scoring variants include awarding an automatic &quot;Chicago&quot; for a holder of a straight flush instead of the normal points awarded for that hand at the end of the round. Others award points equal to the game goal (50, 52, or 100) if the straight flush is also &quot;Royal&quot; (meaning, ranks A, K, Q, J, 10).<br/><br/>Playing a round<br/><br/>Each player (including the dealer) is dealt 5 cards after which 3 phases follow. Before each phase, the players are allowed to discard any unwanted cards face down to the central playing area and are dealt an equal number of replacement cards.<br/><br/>First and Second Phase<br/><br/>Each player may now declare any poker hand which they hold (honor system). Highest hand scores points according to the value of the poker hand combination. The other players do not score. In the case of a tie, highest card used to score the hand wins (highest triple in the event of a full house). If still tied, highest non-scoring card breaks the tie. If still tied, each tied player scores full points.<br/><br/>Variant: If you scored a poker hand, but discard at least one of the scoring cards before the next phase, you must simply announce that you are &quot;not keeping&quot; your hand.<br/><br/>Third Phase<br/><br/>The player to the left of the dealer leads out by playing a card in front of themselves. Each other player must follow suit, if able. The winner of the trick leads out the following trick, and so on.<br/><br/>It is important for all players to keep their own cards separated from other player cards. All played cards should be clearly visible to all players.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the first trick, and only during the first trick, before a player has played their card, they may call &quot;Chicago&quot;. Should this happen, all players gather any cards they played back into their hand (as applicable) and the player who called &quot;Chicago&quot; will lead out instead. In order to score a successful &quot;Chicago&quot;, all five tricks must be won, no exceptions.<br/><br/>Round Scoring<br/><br/>The winner of the fifth and last trick scores 5 points (variant: score 10 points if you won the trick with a 2). As was done during the first two phases, the best poker hand also scores. If a successful &quot;Chicago&quot; was played, no other points are scored. A failed &quot;Chicago&quot; instead results in the caller receiving a score penalty equal to the points normally awarded (-15 or -25 points). A cumulative negative score is possible.<br/><br/>At the end of scoring, if any player has reached the pre-determined final score, the game ends. Otherwise, or in the event of a tie, play continues. Deal passes to the left. The entire deck is re-shuffled before the initial deal each round.<br/><br/>"}, "156891": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bill Burg", "James M.

The game uses a new OpenCL system based on the Unity 3D engine to allow players to change the terrain in anyway, create new objects in any form, and do it anywhere.<br/><br/>In Planet Explorers, it is the year 2287, one of the first colony ships sent out by Earth arrives at the planet Maria, in the Epsilon Indi Star System. During its landing sequence, something appears in front of the massive ship that causes it to lose control and crash into the planet. Some of the colonists survive in lifeboats, but what they find is an unforgiving land filled with creatures ready to outlast the visitors from Earth. Now the survivors must explore, gather, build, create, fight, and ultimately, conquer the land.<br/><br/>The gameplay will be in 3rd and 1st person perspectives. Players will be able to customize their character, combine and create weapons, vehicles, and buildings. At the same time, players will have to defeat multitudes of enemies of varying intelligence and defend the remnants of the colonists. There will also be a mission system that features NPCs giving the player goals to achieve to advance the storyline. The game will feature a single player story line as well as random single and multiplayer adventure maps. Multiplayer will feature prominently in Planet Explorers.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "156899": {"rpgartist": ["Bruno Balixa", "Jacob Blackmon", "Nicholas Cloister", "Todd Gamble", "Rick Hershey", "Mates Laurentiu"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Rise of the Drow: Player's Guide", "rpgdesigner": ["Mike Myler", "Jonathan Nelson", "Stephen Yeardley"], "rpgproducer": ["Joshua Gullion", "Mike Myler", "Jonathan Nelson", "Tommi Salama", "Stephen Yeardley"], "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1969003.jpg", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Edition"], "rpgsetting": ["Aventyr Campaign Setting"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["AAW Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Rise of the Drow"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1969003_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb<br/><br/>Obtain information on Rybalka and the surrounding environs, meet important NPCs, hear local rumors, and discover new races!<br/><br/>The Rise of the Drow Player&rsquo;s Guide is the perfect introduction to the incredible adventure trilogy and brings everything you need to know to join in the game!<br/><br/>"}, "156900": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version (r2)"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Simple Game System", "rpgdesigner": ["Chris Gonnerman"], "rpgproducer": ["Chris Gonnerman"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1968420.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["The Simple Game System"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1968420_t.png", "description": "from the rules:<br/>a role-playing game of supreme simplicity, ease of play, and fast action.<br/><br/>To resolve any action in the game where there is a significant chance of failure, or any action opposed by another character, dice are rolled.

He would be a danger to any survivor if he hadn't decided to focus his murderous instinct on zombies. He finds being surrounded by potential victims that are actively hunting him terribly exciting. The human mind has nothing left to teach him. The zombie mind, however, even though it seems simpler, has an interesting potential. Well, you have been warned.<br/><br/>- Against all odds, Chuck has managed to survive the rise of the zombies. Living in his parent's basement, this 30 something man child's lack of real world experience hasn't been that much of a disadvantage, since there isn't much of a world anymore. Armed with a deep knowledge of zombie survival lore gleaned off videogames and the internet, Chuck is an unlikely, chubby ally - and possible food source if things get desperate.<br/><br/>- &quot;Gary, master of none&quot;, so people used to say. Gary didn't have a solid education and his demeanor seemed too &quot;cool&quot; to find reliable work and live in the mold of everyday people. He was almost a pariah when the apocalypse struck and shattered the &quot;everyday&quot;. Don't be fooled by his outfit: for his casual unconsern, Gary has done well on its own so far. Gary has always been a survivor, and the zombies didn't really change his habbits. If you're open-minded enough to see through Gary's disguise, he could trust you and share his precious tools of the trade.<br/><br/>- Mack's story is like most - an ordinary, happy man untill the zombies rose, forced to dig deep or die. His peacefull previous life hid his true potential - unfortunatly it took burying his wife and two daughters to bring it out. Taking a car from his lot, he began a cross country zombicide, eventually joining the motley crew of survivors. Mack's fighting spirit has made him a precious resource for any team, and his manic grin gets even wider the worse the odds are!<br/><br/>- Working with putty and tiny tools, Mike has been cooped up for years in his home studio sculpting miniatures for boardgames and the like. Obsessed with his craft, he didn't notice when his wife left and took his daughter with her, and he didn't notice the zombie apocalypse either! Well, that is, until he had to stab the mailman in the eye with a sculpting pick, and the wandered outside out of curiousity to find out what was going on. Mike now works with the other survivors, although they're a little disturbed by how much joy he seems to take in the fact that actual real zombies are &quot;finally&quot; running around.<br/><br/>- Smith mustered out of the special forces straight into private &quot;security&quot;, working all over the world for the highest bidder. Specializing in wetwork and asking no questions, Smith was in town for a contract when all hell broke loose. Fortunatly for him, and unfortunatly for the zombies, he had his arsenal stashed nearby. Though used to working alone, even Smith knows he doesn't have enough bullets to take on the zombie hordes by himself.

This battle for the lead enhances the game experience and expands the tactical and strategic possibilities of the players.

It breaks them down into prosthetics (fully functional replacements for normal body parts), bionics (the lite stuff powered off your body's own bioelectric field), and cybernetics (the heavy stuff, requiring a power supply to function). Beyond this, it breaks them down into three categories of minor, moderate, and major. In addition to defining a cost breakdown, this categorization makes it easy for GMs who want to limit the amount and type of implants available in his setting. One GM might permit only light and moderate prosthetics and bionics in his game, while another might allow full cybernetic conversions if the operative can afford it and wants to pay the price.<br/><br/>Implants do mess with your body's harmony and bioelectric field, and some would say your soul.

At least that's how I'm defining it in this case.  My goal is to reinvigorate my love for a beautiful thing.  I love Shadowrun, but sometimes what I really want is Shadowrun's younger, skinnier, sexier cousin.  They're both awesomely amazing and should be checked out as soon as possible.  This game takes the simple elegance of its forebearers and pairs it with the Shadowrun setting and themes we have all grown to cherish.  I hope you enjoy shadow-hack.<br/><br/>"}, "156997": {"poll": [], "name": "Heroes of the Storm", "videogamemode": ["Cooperative", "Network Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3318360.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy", "Science Fiction"], "videogamefranchise": ["Warcraft"], "videogamecharacter": ["Arthas Menethil", "Malfurion Stormrage", "Uther the Lightbringer"], "usersrated": "35", "videogamedeveloper": ["Blizzard Entertainment"], "videogamegenre": ["MOBA / A-RTS"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "videogamehonor": ["2014 Gamescom Best Multiplayer Game of the Year Nominee", "2014 Gamescom Best PC Game of the Year Nominee", "2015 Global Game Awards Best Free-to-Play Game of the Year Nominee", "2015 Global Game Awards Best MOBA Game of the Year Nominee", "2016 D.I.C.E.

The theme and core of this game is quite obviously based off of Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson's classic role-playing game and the various iterations of it that followed. Mechanically, the game takes many influences from the works of Vincent Baker, John Harper, Eric Provost, Kirin Robinson, Adam Koebel, Sage LaTorra, Jason Morningstar, Clinton R. Nixon, and Michael Wight.<br/><br/>At its core, the game's adventuring system is largely inspired by World of Dungeons and its predecessors. For combat, Old School Hack served as the primary model for phased rounds and combat zones. Experience is driven by a system derived from The Shadow of Yesterday. The relationships between the adventurers are culled from various Fiasco playsets. The style is of classic dungeon-delving, dragon-fighting, old-school adventure. I'll admit it is mostly constructed with borrowed materials, tweaked and slapped together into a fantasy frankenstein of sorts, but I thought there was enough here to warrant a name and layout.<br/><br/>"}}
