        "description": "The three players  in Greenland represent the Norse (red), Tunit (green), and Thule (yellow) tribes inhabiting Greenland from the 11th to the 15th centuries.<br/><br/>As a tribe, you attempt to secure food, resources, and technology to increase the size of your tribe and support children, elders, and livestock while also wiping out competing species or gathering resources to collect victory points. You must work around the weather and the extinction of natural resources as well as negotiate deals to protect your wives while you decide between monotheism or polytheism. In this tableau-building game, you'll send your population out to hunt native species of Greenland &mdash; but some might not come back. (Historically, the climate turned frigid and all but the Thule (Inuit) died out.)<br/><br/>In the game, play takes place over six phases; all players complete each phase in turn order, then the next phase starts. Each turn is one generation. In order:<br/><br/><br/>     Resolve events: Examples include elder deaths, animal migrations, feuds, or global cooling. If a trade ship arrives, an auction is held for its wares. <br/>     Assign hunters: Hunters are assigned to hunting grounds, resource gathering, colonizing the New World, raiding other tribes for wives or animals, or promotion to an elder.<br/>     Negotiate: Players can bribe others to peacefully withdraw hunters, including marrying them to their daughters. Players with a War Chief Elder can use hunters to attack others on the same card. The New World turns hostile if there are too many colonists.<br/>     Resolve hunting: Roll a die for each hunter and modify it for technologies and marriages. Success can result in gaining new hunters, resources, hand cards, wives, and/or technologies. Beware, as some animals can be confused by the prey-predator relationship and your hunters might not return. Some successes let your take cards from the central play area into your hand if within hand limit. <br/>     Maintain livestock: Pay to keep the animals you've already domesticated.<br/>     Take elder actions: Examples include invention, domestication, proselytization, and witch-burning. If you have no elders, you can convert to monotheism.<br/><br/><br/>Depending on each player's ending theistic worldview, he has a variable scoring based on successful hunts (polytheism) or resource gathering (monotheism).<br/><br/>LIVING RULES<br/><br/>Vassal module<br/><br/>",

Here there be monsters indeed, from treacherous sea hags and malevolent devilfish luring sailors to be devoured or enslaved to titanic terrors of the deep like the sea serpent and dragon turtle that hunt out of instinct and hunger but pose no less a peril. Size hardly equates to stupidity, however, as clockwork leviathans are relics of ancient and advanced civilizations still following the residual programming from ages long past, while krakens are beings of unfathomable intellect and ineffable evil. Still, a few citizens of the sea might lend a sympathetic flipper if approached the right way, like the selkie and the seaweed leshy. As if these mythic sea monsters were not enough, Mythic Monsters: Sea Monsters also explores an assortment of feats uniquely suited to aquatic creatures, helping to lend a legendary touch to creatures from the briny blue. The 13 sea monsters contained herein, ranging in CR from 3 to 22, are updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every one has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic draugr crew's phantom broadside and ship of the damned to the ionic meltdown and orichalum alloy of a mythic clockwork leviathan!<br/><br/>"

For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.<br/><br/>This installment explores the draconic heritage, and characters whose mythic power comes from the majestic and terrifying creatures known as dragons. Whether you can trace your ancestry back to a powerful and terrible great wyrm, you act as a favored agent for such  creature, or you simply serve as a focal point for the powers of a draconic totem, this mythi heritage allows you to tap into the incredible power of dragons. The book includes 17 new mythic abilities, all of which are part of the draconic mythic heritage. In addition to timeless draconic powers like breath weapons, leathery wings, and scales that turn aside both blades and spells, these abilities also include such powers as the ability to sniff out treasures, empower draconic sorcerer blood, and grow more powerful with age, just as ancient dragons do. Harness the power and majesty of dragons for yourself!<br/><br/>"

Located to coreward of Clement Sector, Peel Subsector is the cutting edge of colonization into this new sector.  The last stops before heading into the unknown!<br/><br/>Laylah was the second world in the subsector to be settled.  The world was settled in 2280 by colonists from Minerva (Franklin 0401) seeking religious freedom.<br/><br/>New Perth is a former Australian colony which was founded in 2284.  New Perth is able to defend itself and project power through the use of Republic of Australia Naval Units which were left stranded here after the Conduit collapsed.<br/><br/>Peel is home to an increasingly unstable military dictatorship.  The most populous planet in the subsector as well as the namesake for the subsector was once a parliamentary democracy but is now inching towards chaos.<br/><br/>Neachdain is a world controlled by a rigid technocracy in which a group of fifteen people determine what is best for the entire population.  Some believe that Neachdans have delusions of grandeur while others feel that the world might someday be an expansionistic threat.<br/><br/>Alverca is an independent colony founded by Portuguese settlers in 2282.  The world is both fiercely Catholic and famous for its wild Carnival.<br/><br/>Rocroi is a small colony founded by a French eccentric, Jean-Marc Savard in 2331. Savard is now the self-styled King of Rocroi.<br/><br/>Ariel is a joint Israeli-Palestinian colony on which religious differences have been set aside to form a new culture.  Ariel was colonized in 2286 and named for the sector itself in an effort to become the predominate world for the sector&rsquo;s future.<br/><br/>The Peel Colonies comes with detailed descriptions of each of these settled worlds along with information concerning the remainder of the Peel subsector.  Random encounters and adventure hooks are included for each world to get your characters into the action with a minimum of preparation.<br/><br/>The Peel Colonies can be used as part of a continuing campaign within Gypsy Knights Games' Clement Sector background or as part of any Traveller or science fiction setting.  These worlds can be used in concert or be taken one at a time for your own Traveller universe.<br/><br/>Adventure awaits in the new colonies!<br/><br/>"

        "description": "Princess Emerald and her companions are questing deep into the Lordship Ruins to confront the evil that resides there. Brooding from his darkened hallways, the Forgotten King is a cursed lord who has pledged himself to the service of the Dark Consul, darkening his once lush and verdant lands. At his side are two new mini-bosses: Trent, a towering guardian of the forest with thick bark and brambles for armor, and Boris, a raging brute with snarling ursine features.<br/><br/>In Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King, players explore the Fae Wood, home of the Kodama, sentient forest spirits with a taste for adventuring Heroes. Wisps lure Heroes into ensnaring traps as terrifying, man-eating plants sprout from the loamy forest floor to devour them. Continue into the Lordship Ruins where the once proud bramble knights, now corrupted and twisted into servants of the Dark Consul, stalk the stony ruins for any who would defile their lord's holdfast. Don't get too close to the trees, though, as we hear the squirrels are in an ill mood.<br/><br/>Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King includes five new Heroes to brave the depths, including the Thundervale Huntress, Fae Alchemist, Royal Warden, and the brave Questing Knight. Each lend a new dynamic to gameplay and your strategy to conquer the Forgotten King and his minions.<br/><br/>Forgotten King contains two play modes: Classic Mode, in which someone controls the dungeon and its monsters while everyone else takes the roles of the plucky heroes, or Arcade Mode, which allows for a fully co-operative game for up to five players.<br/><br/>Forgotten King, while itself a standalone game, is compatible with all previously published Super Dungeon Explore expansions and supplements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nova Suecia - the Board Game&copy; is a board game about colonization, trade and survival in the New World. The players take on the role as governors of the Swedish colony Nova Suecia in the 17th century Delaware. They must cooperate to build a viable economy in the fragile colony since no player can control all parts on his or her own. The colonists need food, the colony needs money and the resources must be manufactured into tradable goods. The players must also, secretely, allocate common and own resources to the budget to prevent the colony from falling to internal and external threats. Each player must thus find a way to get the upper hand in this cooperative act of balance to emerge as a winner in the end. If they fail and the colony of Nova Suecia falls, all players lose!<br/><br/>Game mechanisms include<br/><br/>1. Player balance: The players grow by one district per turn and are thus always equally strong.<br/>2. Game balance: The game has a delicate balance between wealth, food and production. If one area grows on behalf of the others, the game will fall and so will the players.<br/>3. Bidding: All card drawings are followed by biddings where judgement rather than luck determines the outcome.<br/>4. Production &amp; Trade: The players build and develop the game together.<br/>5. Taxation: The players must secretly choose how much to pay for common expenses, thus introducing free-rider and prisoners' dilemma challenges<br/>6. Interdependence: The players must both cooperate and compete to survice.<br/><br/>"

Hawkmoor started off as a setting for the first edition of the World’s Most Popular Role Playing Game, but has been attached to many different game systems since those early days. This document is the latest official version of Hawkmoor, presented here as a companion volume for S. John Ross&rsquo; most excellent Risus: The Anything RPG.<br/><br/>Herein I have tried to take Hawkmoor back to its roots and preserve that &ldquo;old school&rdquo; feel without abandoning the &ldquo;new school&rdquo; design aesthetic that makes Risus tick. Whether I have accomplished this or not is something that I leave up to you, the reader, to determine. Regardless of whether or not I have achieved this goal, I hope that you enjoy Hawkmoor and find that it provides you with many hours of fantasy adventure.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "I have released a series of games oriented towards improving cognitive skills in a number of important areas.  These games have been integrated into a single app called Mind Games.  The games are based, in part, on concepts from cognitive psychology.  The Mind Games app will allow you to track your scores on each of the games.  The scoring system utilizes some concepts from standardized testing so that you can compare your scores with the scores of others and across games.<br/><br/>Description of Games:<br/><br/>Anticipation &ndash; This game allows you to practice your ability to think ahead and respond rapidly.  A series of images appear, and you must choose whether the two on the left match as quickly as possible.  In order to get the best score, you have to also pay attention to the images that are coming next.<br/><br/>Attention Training Game - This game is based on the flanker attention task.  A series of arrows will appear, and you must choose the direction that the middle arrow points, while ignoring the other arrows.<br/><br/>Divided Attention I - This game allows you to practice your divided attention skills and processing speed.  Two categories appear at the top of the screen and a group of images below.  Tap all the images that fall into the two categories as quickly as possible.  To get the best score, keep both categories in mind at the same time.<br/><br/>Face Memory Game &ndash; This game allows you to develop your ability to quickly learn and recognize faces.  Two lists of nine faces are briefly shown, and you must recognize the faces that were shown from faces that were not in the original list.<br/><br/>Math Star - This game will help you practice basic arithmetic skills (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); however, the main point of this game is not arithmetic skills.  The problems are easy, but you must focus and be quick to improve your score. Your score is based on the speed and accuracy of your performance.  Be careful because your attention to detail is important.<br/><br/>Mental Categories - This game will help you practice your mental processing speed and rapid categorization of pictures.  Four types of pictures will display, and your job is to as rapidly and accurately as possible choose the category to which the image belongs.<br/><br/>Mental Flex - This game allows you to practice your cognitive flexibility.  You must rapidly switch mental sets, which is an &ldquo;executive function.&rdquo;  A directive will appear (either Word or Color), and you must choose the shape that matches the directive.  If the directive is Color, you choose the shape that is the color of the word.  If the directive is Word, you choose the shape designated by the word, but ignore the color of the directive.<br/><br/>Memory Racer - This game allows you to practice your working memory, concentration, and processing speed.  You must rapidly decide if each image is the same or different from the image that was previously displayed.<br/><br/>Memory Span - The game allows you to practice your attention, concentration, and working memory.  A series of stimuli are displayed on each trial and highlighted in a specific order.  Your job is to pay close attention and touch the images in the same order after they are displayed.<br/><br/>Serial Memory Game &ndash; This game allows you to improve your sequential memory.  You will be presented with a sequence of 10 numbers and 10 faces on the second trial.  You attempt to learn this 10 item sequence in as few trials as possible.  This seems very difficult at first, but keep trying and you will learn the sequence.<br/><br/>Spatial Memory Game &ndash; This game allows you to improve your memory for spatial locations.  A grid of tiles is presented, and tiles will flip over on each trial.  Remember as many tiles as you can, and then flip the tiles to match the initial presentation.<br/><br/>Visual Memory Game &ndash; This game allows you to improve your visual memory.  You will be presented with a mix of visual stiumuli and then be asked to identify the stimuli you saw versus new stimuli.<br/><br/>Vocabulary Star - This game allows you to improve your vocabulary and spelling skills.  It contains a large database of words and their definitions.  The words are at a high school through college level.  You will need to practice this game for several months.  It is a fun way to increase your word knowledge.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "from the Introdvction:<br/>This booklet is my unofficial response to William Dowie&rsquo;s challenge1 to craft an awesome old-school Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) adventure with an ancient Roman theme. Strictly speaking, this is not a traditional stand-alone &ldquo;module&rdquo; type adventure, but more of an outline of ideas and first steps for setting up Roman-era characters in a unique sandbox setting. Everything herein<br/>should be usable in any TSR edition of D&D or related retro-clone (Labyrinth Lord, Swords & Wizardry, OSRIC, and so on).<br/><br/>As you may also guess, XVI Troop was designed to be a quick facilitator to tacking on an ancient Roman feel to the basic D&amp;D rules while also folding in a bit of light-hearted fun, imported from some old TV situation comedies. Will this particular mash-up work at the game table? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out!<br/><br/>The basic idea for the setting is an out-of-the-way Roman fort on the northern British frontier. The site of VINDOLANDA, just south of Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall in what is now called Northumberland, contains an auxiliary fort, or castrum, filled with (mostly) locally recruited troops. What few true Roman citizens are present are figureheads, tolerated for the order they maintain. The time-frame is around 140&ndash;150 AD. The emperor Antoninus is busy trying to extend the bounds of the empire northward, and is building the Antonine Wall 100 miles to the north in Scotland. Vindolanda hasn&rsquo;t seen a full Roman legion &ndash; or the discipline that goes with it &ndash; in decades, but that all may be changing with the arrival of a new commanding officer.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "For almost three hundred years no Coldrum set foot in Mossdown, a largely self-imposed exile recently ended by my acquisition of the ruins of our ancestral home. With the restoration of Coldrum Manor ongoing, there has never been a better time to document its history, and it seems apt that it should be a Coldrum to relate the tale.<br/><br/>Coldrum Manor, more commonly known as the derisory &ldquo;Redcap Manor&rdquo;, was built atop Mossdown Hill, a site long associated with spirits and faeries. Legend speaks of a series of standing stones that once stood near the hill, and Roman records of the area describe pagan rites involving human sacrifice. The strategic location of Mossdown Hill has long been recognised, and several strongholds have been constructed at this site over the last one thousand years.<br/><br/>'Redcap Manor' draws from the most traditional tales of haunting in the British Isles, in which it was faeries, not ghosts, that kept people awake at night. In 'Redcap Manor', each player represents one of four Edwardian investigators sent to the titular mansion, to gather as much evidence for the uncanny as they can over three nights. To this end, the protagonists will use the recently-harnessed power of electromagnetism against the Fae.<br/><br/>'Redcap Manor' is an auction/bluffing card game, divided into three turns representing the three nights of terror. Each turn, the players select a number of Haunt cards from their hand, to be secretly shuffled into the Haunt deck for the next night. Haunt cards are divided into three types: Fae, Presence, and Influence cards, each of which is countered by a different Ward card. Each player then places one of their three Ward cards face-down, and takes it in turns to uncover the top-most Haunt card. Eight cards are revealed per turn, representing eight hours before the dawn. After revealing a Haunt card, a player may choose to flee the Manor, but may not re-enter that night. The Haunt card remains face-up, and may be taken by subsequent players, together with any newly revealed cards. Alternatively, the player may take the Haunt card(s) - any Haunt cards countered by their Ward are taken as evidence (victory points); however, if the top-most card is not countered by their Ward, it is taken as a curse. Each Haunt card (24 unique cards, one for each hour of each night) has its own effect, influencing how the game is played. The player must determine whether taking a curse is worth the opportunity to acquire more evidence.<br/><br/>At the end of the third night, the player with the most evidence points is the victor.<br/><br/>"

As citizens are added, they consume food at a particular rate of food per second.  When employed as farmers, food is generated to counter this rate.  Thus, a stockpile or deficit of food is produced.  The same occurs for the civilizations wood and stone, which is used to construct buildings and upgrade the civilization.<br/>Eventually, a player must employ blacksmiths, apothecaries, clerics, and so on, to manage other effects in their empire such as production of metal, illness, piety, and more.<br/><br/>All of these events and statistics are measured in numbers that change each second depending on the status of employed citizen, random events, and - most centrally - the player's mad clicking to manually collect resources and manage the civilization.<br/><br/>"

The board is replaced by a square grid made of nine street cards. The suspects, and among them Mr.Jack, are pictured on the cards. Holmes, Watson and a dog are turning around the grid, a system already used by Bruno Cathala in several games, and can &ldquo;look&rdquo; at the streets in a row or column. Every round, like in Mr.Jack, four actions are available. The first player selects one, his opponent two, and the first player then uses the last remaining action. Actions allow moving a detective one or two spaces clockwise around the grid, turning a card in order to change the view of the streets, swapping two street cards or drawing an alibi card. At the end of the round, Mr.Jack states if he can be seen by one of the detectives. Of course, the detectives must identify Jack, who must stay hidden long enough to escape.<br/><br/>Source: BoardGameGeek, Mr. Jack Pocket<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>Without the formality of a declaration of war, in October 1935 Italian armies stormed into Ethiopia from both north and south. Badly outgunned and outnumbered, the Imperial Ethiopian Army resisted for six months before its final collapse. Italian forces deployed tanks, aircraft and poison gas against the Ethiopian levies, who fought back with suicidal courage and little else.<br/><br/>Conquest of Ethiopia is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these battles. You do not need any other game to play any of its 40 scenarios. Design is by Lorenzo Striuli and Ottavio Ricchi, authors of our Fronte Russo supplement.<br/><br/>The Italian invaders rely heavily on colonial troops, long-service professionals recruited in Eritrea, Somalia and Libya. They also have Blackshirts, Carabinieri, elite Alpini mountain troops, tanks and a great deal of air power. And the Italian advantages continue: motor transport, much more artillery and armored cars.<br/><br/>Ethiopia&rsquo;s defenders include the elite Imperial Guard, and a number of regular battalions that are fairly good troops armed with modern weapons. Beyond that, things get a pretty bad for the Ethiopians pretty quickly. There are three distinct Ethiopian forces at play: the Imperial Regulars, the Imperial Levies (local forces loyal to the throne) and Provincial Levies (local forces loyal to their own leaders, usually a Ras or Duke). None of the levies are very well-armed.<br/><br/>The game includes eight semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with all others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too). Plus 517 playing pieces: smooth, scorchless, sootless laser-cut pieces, a joy just to hold in your hands. And 40 scenarios.<br/><br/>This game is sold only direct from Avalanche Press.<br/><br/>",

Conflict of Heroes: Ghost Divisions adds two exciting new campaigns to Conflict of Heroes as well as full multiplayer support, allowing those campaigns to be played head to head using the integrated multiplayer server.<br/><br/>Army Group Center, under the command of Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, fought a series of pocket battles as it pushed towards Moscow in the summer of 1941.<br/><br/>The Army Group consisted of the 4th Army ( von Kluge ) and the 9th Army (Strauss ) in the center.<br/><br/>The wings of the Army Group were the fast moving armor and motorised units of the two Panzer Groups.  Panzer Group 3 under Hermann Hoth formed the Northern wing.  Panzer Group 2 under Heinz Guderian formed the Southern wing.  The two Panzer Groups smashed through the Russian defenses and performed a series of pincer movements, trapping large groups of enemy forces.<br/><br/>The speed with which these forces moved and the surprise that their appearance often created in the enemy often made them seem like ghosts, appearing in areas where no enemies were thought to be to strike suddenly at a flank or encircle a strong position.  Speed, coordination, concentration and combined arms allowed the Wehrmacht to control the initiative and keep the Red Army reeling.<br/><br/>Still, the forces of the Panzer Groups were often stretched thin. Some Soviet units fought to escape, while others fought to open the pockets to save their comrades. Many battles were chaotic and the front lines shifted as the battles evolved. In the end, hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers surrendered, and entire Russian Armies were destroyed.<br/><br/>Conflict of Heroes: Ghost Divisions puts you in command of platoon and company-sized forces from the 7th Panzer Division and the Grossdeutschland Regiment in challenging scenarios that can be played as part of two linked campaigns or as completely stand-alone scenarios.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"

The main goal of each player is to use game cards inspired by the world of archaeological science and collect so called scientific points.<br/><br/>The first player who reaches the required amount of scientific points wins the game. Obtaining those points depends on the abilities of individual cards (and their combinations), that are used for construction of gaming decks. These cards are divided into five main card types. A player can play artecafts, archaeological sites, scientists, event cards and cards of so called written sources. Cards are also divided in unique and non-unique categories (unique means that you can play a card just once, non-unique cards can be played multiple times) and temporary (especially event cards) and permanent cards. Every player owns his or her own constructed deck, whose construction and the ability to defeat an opponent depends clearly on his or her combinational skill and his or her own inventiveness.<br/>During the game players draw cards from their decks and play them from their hands. They can play cards to support their gaming strategy or to disturb the opponent's game.<br/><br/>The game primarily serves as an instrument of popularization and education in archaeology.<br/><br/>",

It was designed to be the start (or part of) an ongoing campaign where the GM and the players can explore the Thaecian<br/>Isles together. So instead of the regular adventure or a dry sourcebook, the islands are presented as an open-ended realm where the characters can explore freely, encountering adventure and danger at every turn.<br/><br/>Designed for a mid-to high level party.<br/><br/>It begins with the player characters receiving a mission to find a Gnorl&rsquo;s missing Secret. She will pay the for the characters to reach Thaecia Isle just in time for the famous Festival of the Bizarre. While the hunt for the Secret is the impetus for the characters to travel to the islands, they are in no way constrained to follow the one plotline and are free to explore any part of the islands they desire. While terrible dangers lurks at every turn, there is also the opportunity for great rewards, including the chance to uncover rare magics and treasures not seen since the Great Disaster.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "What do you get when you mix Chaos, Cribbage, and Carnage?<br/><br/>War Elephant Racing (W.E.R.) is a fast paced game of chance and skill. War elephants will be bumping and crashing into each other on a tight course sending the others into a spin that will cost them crucial game points. Players must carefully balance a number of objectives, be quick with reactions, and recognize all of the scoring combinations to be able to beat their opponent. It is a game where experience counts for a great deal although a little bit of luck always helps. New and young players will be able to jump in fairly quickly and give the vets a run for their money.<br/><br/>War Elephant Racing uses Xhaos cards to spice up the race and increase the competitive action. Xhaos cards are special cards that call upon a special ability of an elephant of renown to give the players huge advantages to use against their competition. Special timing will provide the players with an edge over the other war elephant racers.<br/><br/>War Elephant Racing is played closely to Cribbage, each player is dealt war elephant racing cards and then must take turns laying one card at a time from their hand to attempt to get pairs, runs, and target numbers to score points. Each point allows the player to move their elephant an equal amount of points. Once each player has played all of the cards from their hand they then take turns adding up the different combinations of &quot;points&quot; in their hand to move their elephants. Players move around the tight track for six laps.<br/><br/>While players are moving their elephants if they land in a space that has another elephant they &quot;bump&quot; them. When a bump occurs the bump dice are rolled allowing the elephant to pass through, or send the bumped elephant in a spin, or send themselves in a spin costing valuable points.<br/><br/>War Elephant Racing also has &quot;Xhaos&quot; cards which allow them to make ranged attacks, powerful bumps, throw spectators in the path, and more. The xhaos cards are a great fun edge that each player will have to help them win the race. Almost all of the xhaos cards are named after famous elephants in history, and their effect in the game is related to their fame.<br/><br/>",

The other power-hungry drow families of Holoth may despise her but they know a true leader when they see one, and House Gullion has been revealed as the path to glory.

        "description": "Autumn, 1739. Fierce economic competition between Britain and Spain has broken into open war: the War of Jenkin&rsquo;s Ear.<br/><br/>As His Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s naval commander-in-chief in the Caribbean, your duties have suddenly multiplied. Their Lordships at the Admiralty demand action. Parliament expects the speedy conquest of Spain&rsquo;s New World possessions &ndash; ALL of them &ndash;&nbsp;but is unwilling to supply men and ships. That would require the adoption of methods suitable only under a &lsquo;French Despotism&rsquo;. Before you utter them let it be known that your objections are unpatriotic and un-British. Meanwhile, the powerful Planters&rsquo; Lobby is insisting you make defending their islands your top priority, while the equally powerful Traders&lsquo; Lobby is demanding convoy protection and simultaneously accusing you of &lsquo;pressing&rsquo; merchant seamen into service aboard your ships.<br/> Or, can you honourably serve the great House of Bourbon, whose scions rule France and Spain? The English heretics have unjustly fabricated a war. They are jealous of Spain&rsquo;s greatness and desire her colonies for their own. For years they have paid lip service to the international laws of commerce while breaking those same laws at every opportunity. Of late, His Most Catholic Majesty had graciously agreed to accept arbitration for so-called &lsquo;wrongs&rsquo; done to British traders, waiving compensation for similar wrongs done to Spain. But when she offered payment, the English dogs slapped Spain&lsquo;s hand aside, saying it was not enough! This insult will not go unavenged. The King has ordered you to secure our trade routes and has issued letters of marque for the harrying of British merchantmen &ndash; let their own methods be used against them! In the fulness of time, our brother France has promised his support.<br/><br/>Control the seas and you control the fate of the New World. Whichever side you choose, glory and honour &ndash; and prizes galore &ndash; are yours for the taking. Provided you avoid court martial and disgrace.<br/><br/>Yellow Jack is a naval war game for two players, set during the years 1739-1743. It explores the roles of the navies of Britain, Spain, and France in the Caribbean. Scale is &ldquo;operational&rdquo; &ndash; that is, the playing pieces represent squadrons of as many as four ships, rather than individual men-o-war. Other counters represent leaders (good and bad), &ldquo;light&rdquo; forces such as frigates and galleys, and &ldquo;formations&rdquo; that allow you to concentrate your forces.<br/><br/>Tactical themes are eschewed in favour of operational issues: keeping your forces in fighting trim, being at the right place at the right time, &amp; dealing with a mounting list of instructions, orders, and unfilfillable mandates from your Government. Combat, though abstracted, takes into account leadership, the class and condition of your ships, and of course the Weather Gauge. In an Age of Sail, wind and water conditions are critical, even at the &ldquo;operational&rdquo; level. Movement uses a point-to-point system where costs change with the wind and you will often be unable to go where you desire. Actions are &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo;, but unlike many naval games, plotting is not required.

        "description": "from the website:<br/><br/>... I wasn't enthralled with some of the particulars of [the Amber Diceless] system (such as the fact that the outcome of all conflicts is clearly determined even before they begin).<br/><br/>To get around this aspect of pre-determined outcome a system of token spending has been implimented in Fiat. Token systems are nothing groundbreaking in RPGs. Similar things have been used before to help skew the odds of a given outcome in games using dice. But in Fiat spending tokens doesn't simply provide a greater chance of success at a given action, it causes events in general to unfold in a more unlikely (and hopefully more impressive or interesting) way that the player intends.<br/><br/>So while the outcome of a conflict is no longer pre-determined neither is it left to chance. Whatever happens at least one of the conflict participants will end up having the narrative unfold as they prefer.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "from What it is About:<br/><br/>One of the primary goals of the DRAT System is to create a role-playing system that facilitates systems and settings that do not translate well to traditional role-playing systems. That is to say, settings like Star Trek have elements which are inconsistent. Traditional RPGs often functions best in consistent set of setting presumptions. If a players fires his phaser at a ship and it is powerful enough to destroy it then he will reasonably expect it to happen every time he fires at a ship. However, in many stories there are exceptions that move the story forward.<br/><br/>To resolve this we need to look to cooperative role-playing systems. In this manner, a group of like minded people can use such a system to explore settings that do not follow a predictable set of rules. Plot exceptions can be agreed upon by the Group and not become a point of disruption in a game but rather an event to drive the story forward.<br/><br/>from DRAT System:<br/>DRAT System stands for Dice-less Role-playing And Tactics System. The goal of this system is to provide the tools for a cooperative storytelling experience. If everyone in the group is not committed to telling a story, the game will not work. To that end, make sure that all members of the group are aware and willing to participate in telling the story as well as describing their character&rsquo;s action.<br/><br/>"

I quickly read all four books in the series in quick succession and then re-read them. As I read, I kept wondering if J.K. Rowling was a former gamer, because the parameters of her world were so carefully thought out. Underneath the prep school fantasy, there was a tautly constructed world with its own internal logic that begged to be further fleshed out.<br/><br/>This variant requires GURPS Basic at the very least. A full-fledged GURPS Harry Potter campaign requires GURPS Compendium I, Grimoire and Magic as well. GURPS Bestiary, Fantasy Bestiary, Fantasy Folk and Undead are handy, but not essential.<br/><br/>"

All cards are played on top of one another so that only the most recently played card is visible.<br/><br/>If a played card matches the rank (number) of the top card of the pile (e.g. a &quot;6&quot; is played on top of another &quot;6&quot;) it creates a &quot;breakaway&quot; for that player. Jacks always create breakaways when played, regardless of the previous card in the stack.<br/><br/>Once a breakaway has been created, that player now needs to try to match the rank of the next card played by the opponent. If able to do so, a goal is scored.<br/><br/>The player with the most goals at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "Stormy Weather is two player game about two mad scientists competing to win a gardening trophy, using a series of increasingly powerful weather machines. Play takes place on a 3x5 board, where each square has one of five types of weather. Players take on the identity (and abilities) of one of the mad scientists.<br/><br/>Players use their weather machines to move or create weather, with the aim of getting good weather to their side of the board or giving bad weather to their opponents. These can range from the humble remote control cloud to the gargantuan Noahmatic or the planetary realigner. Each machine can normally be used once per round, so the sequencing of play is important. At the end of each turn, sun and rain help gardens to grow, while heatwave and lightning cause them to wither and die.<br/><br/>The final action of the game comes from the play of a 'taunt' card, which contains a special, hidden move and an associated threat to yell at your opponent.<br/><br/>The player with the most flowers at the end of the game will be the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each card depicts an event in the history of the Belgian television, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>Timeline: 60 ans de t&eacute;l&eacute;vision &agrave; la RTBF can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Card Hockey League is an ice hockey simulation game played with a standard deck of 52 cards.<br/><br/>The two players take on the roles of team managers. The game is played over 3 rounds (periods). The players should ideally play facing each other and have access to a 6-card inverted pyramid game area.<br/><br/>Each game area consists of 3 rows. The row closest to the player represents the goalkeeper. A single card is placed in this row. The second row holds two cards, representing defenders. The third, and final row, holds three cards, representing the forwards on the team. All cards are placed face up in a portrait orientation except the goalkeeper which is placed face down in a landscape orientation.<br/><br/>The first player, determined in whatever fashion the players desire, shuffles the deck and secretly looks at the top card. He can choose to place this card in any open position in his own play area. Once placed, the card cannot be moved. Once all six spots are filled, the deck is passed to the opponent who fills his own six spots in like manner.<br/><br/>Players take turns advancing on their opponent. Each turn begins with the player flipping over the top card of the deck and comparing it to his opponent's line of forwards. If the card matches or beats another card in value, both cards are discarded and the player is considered having advanced past that hockey player. If multiple cards meet the criteria, the player chooses which route to take.<br/><br/>There is a strategic element when deciding which route to take when advancing on your opponent. With your first card, you compare against the three forwards. Once you have overcome a forward, your options for advancement may be limited. At no point are you allowed to skip another card in order to reach a more favorable card.<br/><br/>Let's say that you use your first card to overtake the center forward with your first card &mdash; you now have clear line of sight to both remaining forwards and the two defenders, but the goal is still blocked. If, on the other hand, you advanced past the left side forward, only the center forward and left defender are &quot;open&quot; to you.<br/><br/>Once the goal is &quot;open&quot;, you are free to attempt to score at any point. You simply announce that you will shoot instead of taking on a hockey player. Your card is compared to the value of the goalkeeper. If your card is <i>higher</i> in value, you have scored a goal. Regardless, both cards are discarded as usual.<br/><br/>Whether a goal is successfully scored or not, it is now your opponents turn. Play also switches if you fail to successfully overtake enough players to clear an open path to your opponent's goal.<br/><br/>Your opponent will begin his turn by first filling any open spots as was done when the game began. He then takes his turn as normal.<br/><br/>Special Rule: When only one card is left in the deck, a player may, on his turn, assuming his team slots are filled, attempt a shot on goal regardless of whether an open path exists or not.<br/><br/>Once the deck is exhausted, the period is considered having ended. All cards are gathered up, play switches to the next player who shuffles and drafts his team as was done at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>Once three periods have been played, the player with the most goals is declared the winner. There are no rules for breaking ties.<br/><br/>",

You will be amazed about what you will find out about your friends.<br/><br/>It's a simple and fun adult card game that is different every time you play, as different groups will respond in different ways. You will find out more about your friends or new people at a party. You will be amazed and surprised about the answers you get to intimate, probing questions. We are sure you will be surprised about what you learn about your friends.<br/><br/>In its simplistic form, a dealer reads a question from the deck and you anonymously answer 'Yes' or 'No'. The dealer tries to guess how many answered 'Yes' or 'No', and if they guess correctly, they keep the question card. If not the dealer decides which stories they want to hear why people answered 'Yes' or 'No'. If the dealer wants to hear the 'Yes' stories and you as a player answered yes, you can choose to tell the story to win the card, or keep quiet and remain anonymous. If there are more than one 'Yes' cards, then multiple people can tell their stories and the dealer decides which story wins. At the end of the game, the player who has gathered the most cards wins the game.<br/><br/>The great thing about this game is that you have the freedom to choose to remain anonymous or to share the stories behind your answer - so you decide on what to divulge to the group you&rsquo;re playing with, it allows you to freely express something in public without the repercussions.<br/><br/>The game provides the environment to share stories and situations and engage in conversations that you would not normally engage in. You will be amazed what you find out about your friends. Is an adult game(18+), so as you can imagine there are some pretty risque questions.<br/><br/>Here are a couple of 'tame' sample questions in the deck:<br/><br/>Have you ever had a DUI?<br/>Have you ever been arrested?<br/>Have you ever lied on a tax return?<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Ages ago, a religious order known as the Druun practiced rituals from inside sacred oak groves, ceremonial pools, and stone henges. In time, the Church of Law and Order suppressed the Druunic teachings, and the ancient holy sites were lost, forgotten, or converted to other uses.<br/><br/>One such former site is located in the capital city of Dolmvay in the center of a small neighborhood known as Whiteoak Square. This neighborhood has recently been experiencing a strange phenomenon: At night, small dancing lights have been seen floating throughout the neighborhood. The residents were afraid of this sorcery at first, however, the lights seem to exude a feeling of peace and contentment, and the locals have grown used to them.<br/><br/>How it Started<br/><br/>A few weeks ago, a butcher named Walton Brand was clearing out his cellar when he stumbled upon a secret underground passage that led to an ancient Druun hall. This hall was filled with lost relics, arcane lore, and forgotten treasures of the Druun.<br/><br/>Walton told his friends, Loomis the Baker and the chandler Stefan of Walsbury, and the three men began sneaking away from their wives at night to dress in Druun finery and pretend to be men of wealth. A harlot named Red Kirsten was hired to attend them as they drank, feasted, and cavorted in the sacred hall.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to the revelers, the Druun hall still retained some of its magical powers and their merriment awakened the ancient guardian spirits of the grove. These creatures, known as faerlings, are the lights that have been seen dancing throughout the neighborhood. The faerlings were given life by the revelers' glee, and they project that joy and happiness onto the other residents of the neighborhood. This glee, however, is about to turn to horror. . .<br/><br/>Oak Grove Whispers is a Labyrinth Lord adventure designed for 3-6 characters of 1st-3rd levels (about 10 levels total). The adventure is broken up into three chapters that take place in a small neighborhood located in the capital city of Dolmvay (the Labyrinth Lord is free to substitute any medium- to large-sized city from his own campaign world).<br/><br/>Oak Grove Whispers involves a mixture of roleplaying, investigation, and dungeon crawling, so a diverse range of classes is recommended. As the adventure is set in a civilized city, the characters must also be careful their interaction with NPCs does not land them on the wrong side of the law.<br/><br/>"

The secret cave of the mystics holds a hoard of treasure vast enough to buy the kingdom seven times over. Gold coins piled as high as snow banks! Gleaming swords and jewel-encrusted wands crackling with arcane energy! Precious gems as large as your fist! The only thing standing between your present circumstances and a life of fabulous wealth is a pesky, slumbering elder god with a penchant for consuming entire worlds, an endless army of vat-grown hybrid monstrosities, a veritable tidal wave of disembodied eyes with awesome powers, giant acid worms, and a curse with the power to rip the still-living eyes from your skull. Do you have the mettle to stare down a god or will your eyes forever adorn the vault of The One Who Watches From Below?<br/><br/>The winner of the Mystery Map Adventure Design Competition! In June 2012, Goodman Games sponsored a special adventure design competition. Our Free RPG Day 2012 adventure module included an incomplete adventure map. Readers could complete the map, send in their associated &shy;adventure proposal, and compete for a $1,000 contract to write that adventure. A panel of distinguished judges read the flood of proposals, and finally whittled the field down to a handful of contenders. After lengthy debate, a winner was chosen.<br/><br/>This adventure is the winner of the Mystery Map Adventure Design Competition. There were many great submissions to the competition, but Jobe Bittman&rsquo;s stood out above them all. This adventure has a strong Appendix N theme, unique encounters that your players will remember for a long time, many highly visual scenes that will stand out in your players&rsquo; minds, and some terrific twists and turns. It also features one of the most creative player handouts you have ever seen. Prepare for a very fun time. We think you&rsquo;ll enjoy this adventure as much as we did.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Forbidden Spells of Incredible Power!<br/><br/>Everyone knows that there are some spells that are too dangerous, too wild, or just plain too powerful for any ambitious mage to cast. These rare, exotic, and above all forbidden spells are few and far between, but the immense opportunity that they provide to those who find a way to claim them is well worth the risks. And the risks are many: not only is there a risk that any practitioner who takes up such a spell will be hunted for dabbling in forbidden and &ldquo;black&rdquo; magic, but the spells themselves invite danger, and by casting them, the mage opens himself up for the possibility of losing control, and causing a terrible calamity.<br/><br/>Still, such forbidden magic is highly desirable to spellcasters of every sort, because despite all of that, or perhaps because of it, these spells contain more power than those of the average sorcerer or wizard. Destroy your enemies with powerful killing spells like power word massacre and damnation, or take up more defensive magic, like mirror of the witch, which surrounds the caster with nigh-impenetrable mirrors that protect her from all forms of attack. Alternatively, cast dance of demons, and laugh as your victims destroy themselves and each other by enacting a vrock&rsquo;s dance of ruin. Strip virtually any target of spellcasting ability with demise of the warlock, or force your victims to kill themselves with proclamation of suicide.<br/><br/>The Book of Forbidden Magic includes 47 new spells with the forbidden descriptor. These spells are more powerful than traditional spells, but come with a drawback in the form of profane points, and the possibility that each time one is cast, they may cause a horrible calamity to befall the caster. The book also contains detailed rules governing profane points and calamities, including nearly 50 different specific types of potential calamities, from horrible magical backlash of various sorts to accidental planar rifts of all kinds and numerous sorts of mental intrusion by otherworldly entities. If you want spellcasting in your game to be more exciting, or are looking for more options for your character and enjoy taking risks and dabbling with powers man was not meant to know, look no further than The Book of Forbidden Magic.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "from On OD&amp;D's Setting:<br/>The map from Avalon Hill's Outdoor Survival was the stated setting of original Dungeons & Dragons, and it's gotten a lot of love as a simple world for hexcrawling. If the hexes are 5 miles across, then it's about 175 miles by 180 miles - or 31,500 square miles, a heavily forested inland area that's around the size of South Carolina or the Czech Republic. Here is the description of this world:<br/><br/>&quot;The so-called Wilderness really consists of unexplored land, cities and castles, not to mention the area immediately surrounding the castle (ruined or otherwise) which housed the dungeons.&quot;<br/><br/>If you actually read the wilderness description in OD&D volume 3: The Underworld & Wilderness Adventures, it turns out that the implied details of the setting are weird. Fighters in castles demand to be jousted, magic-users cast Geas and send them out after treasure, clerics demand a tithe or send the characters on a Quest.<br/><br/>But the real weirdness, and this was apparently confirmed in Gary Gygax's campaigns, is what is there when you start wandering about the wilderness. Mountains are haunted by cavemen and necromancers; deserts are home of nomads and dervishes. The &quot;Optional&quot; animal listings turns swampland into the Mesozoic Era - rather than alligators and snakes it is full of tyrannosaurs and triceratops. Arid plains are Barsoomian, with banths, thoats, calots and the lot, while mountains are outright paleolithic, peopled by mammoths, titanotheres, mastodons, and sabre-tooth cats. Gygax confirms this:<br/><br/>&quot;When I was using the pre-World of Greyhawk map for my world setting, the West Coast of North America was the Pleistocene<br/>region inhabited by savage cavemen and their contemporary fauna.&quot;<br/><br/>... more and more I'm finding that I like the idea of this setting. It's radically different from, say, the more comfortable World of Greyhawk, or most other fantastic realms; it's a true outland, where civilization hangs on by a thread. It leaves open terrific possibilities; the nomads, dervishes, cavemen, and berserkers all live in the world around towns; so do centaurs and pixies and minotaurs. I want to start to go into what the oddities of this setting are, and how they fit; it's a good match for the concept of &quot;Demon-Haunted Lands,&quot; which I'm seeing more and more as a way to make something unique out of this setting.<br/><br/>user summary:<br/>An edited collection of essays on various aspects of the implied OD&amp;D setting based upon the map from Avalon Hill's Outdoor Survival boardgame, which was part of the recommended additional equipment for the original Dungeons & Dragons.  Essay topics include character strongholds and their relationship to the landscape, and discussions of the common terrain types and what effect terrain has on other aspects of the game.<br/><br/>"

Your tank, marked by a unique color, carries a special payload that must be fired from &quot;The Zone&quot; to disable the enemies communications base. Reach The Zone with your commander, and you win. Capture the enemy commander, and you win.<br/><br/>So how do you do it? To reach The Zone, you must navigate the terrain and capture or circumvent enemy tanks. To capture a tank, move your tank into the space it occupies.<br/><br/>Each space on the board features one of four types of terrain, either dirt, grass, hill, or mud. Each space gives you a different combination of attack and movement range when you move from that space. You can get stuck in the mud with a movement of zero, or blast down a hill with a movement of 2! Your attack range is consistently 1, except for when you have the high vantage point of the hill space.<br/><br/>This has the feel of a classic strategy game like Othello or Stratego. It's very simple to learn but hard to master. Understanding the terrain and effectively positioning your forces will be the key to your success. Pretty simple, right? Then get moving, Commander!<br/><br/>"

You will be going back to the Communist era during the winter of 1983 to fight for ration cards for meat, sugar and other goods. Your goal is to buy the goods on your shopping list before your guests arrive.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the goods in stores are rationed, and the number and kind of ration cards distributed rarely corresponds with what you need. Instead those cards might land in the hands of other players. You soon realize that success depends on how clever and smooth you are in exchanging ration cards with players standing in the same queue &mdash; but you need to hurry as the clerk will finish her tea in just one minute and start selling the goods.<br/><br/>As with all IPN publications, Reglamentacja: Gra na Kartki was created as an educational tool to remind the world of why the Communist economy fell. The richly illustrated booklet includes a historic overview of the last decade of Communism in Poland and the principles of distribution of controlled goods.<br/><br/>",

On one side you have the Mayor - respected, powerful, able to affect real change. On the other side you have the Village Idiot.<br/><br/>Challenge other players to a battle of skill and luck. Add to the rules of the game as you seize power but beware! No one is above the law. Claw your way to the top and do your best to stay there in this fast, fun, trick taking game with a twist! Village Idiot plays in less than an hour for 3-10 people. You'll be jumping right out of your seat!<br/><br/>Based on several classic party games, Village Idiot combines trick taking, rules making and six rounds of play with every round progressively changing as players build upon the basic rules.<br/><br/>Objective: Become the mayor of your small, medieval village.<br/><br/>Game Play: The entire deck is dealt out to all of the players. The deck consists of numbered cards from 2 - 15. Several cards have special abilities or act as wild cards.<br/><br/>In round one, whoever has the Start card (a 4) begins play. Each player must then play one or two cards of a higher number. Play continues clockwise. The first player to discard all of their cards becomes the Mayor and scores 5 points. The second becomes the Councilor and scores 4 points, and so on.<br/><br/>The last player with cards in their hand becomes the Village Idiot.<br/><br/>Players then rearrange their seating So that play begins with the Mayor, proceeds to the Councilor and so on. The player who has become the Mayor then gets to add one rule to the game, which must be followed until the game ends. Any player who does not follow this rule finds themselves drawing more cards rather than playing them.<br/><br/>The game continues for six rounds, with seating changing and new rules entering play. At the end of the sixth round, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Easy to learn as all of the rules fit on two standard, poker sized cards. Village Idiot can be played with family or friends and be as fun or as cutthroat as you want it to be!<br/><br/>"

Though not all hallways are exciting, occasionally you can add an extra splash to their surroundings and make them wonder what else they've missed. It starts by determining which sense you use for the description, then deciding what element you&rsquo;re describing and gaining some sensory detail about that element.<br/><br/>For example, if you&rsquo;re detailing a castle hallway filled with mirrors (Smell/Mirrors/Cracking) you might get...<br/><br/>&ldquo;Many small mirrors line the walls of this hallway. Now aged and dirty, if you clean some of the grime away you can see cracks forming in the silver backing of a few. But it's the smell you find odd... a combination of dust and an unfamiliar dampness as though something wet is oozing through those cracks behind each pane of glass...&rdquo;<br/><br/>Thousands of possible combinations will inspire an insane number of adventurous encounters and hidden dangers. Your players may wonder if you double as an actor in horror movies with all the crazy things you add to the scene...<br/><br/>This is the next in a series of short (2- to 4-page), system-neutral supplements from Moebius Adventures designed to encourage more creative descriptions in your games.<br/><br/>"

Most of their abilities seen to be an amalgamation of the powers of several different types of creature that qualify as potential originators of that bloodline. That is absolutely fine for a sorcerer whose bloodline originated in exposure to some demonic energy, or a blessing from the heavens. But what if your bloodline is more focused?.<br/><br/>This book is for those sorcerers that can trace their actual ancestry back to a specific influx of exotic blood. It offers you 16 new variant sorcerer bloodlines for your game, each one a new take on one of the core bloodlines. Each has a list of bonus spells and bonus feats applicable to the bloodline, a new bloodline arcana, and at least one (and as many as five), replacement bloodline powers. Select from among the following:<br/><br/>     Artificer &ndash; An arcane bloodline that specialises in the use of charged magic items rather than metamagic.<br/>     Barbed &ndash; An infernal sorcerer with a spiky outlook on life whose ancestry can be traced back to spiny devils.<br/>     Depthspawn &ndash; The blood of slimy deep sea aberrations flows through the veins of this sorcerer.<br/>     Faerie &ndash; This fey sorcerer has actual faeries in its ancestry.<br/>     Famulus &ndash; This arcane sorcerer develops a special link with a familiar, granting the creature incredible special abilities.<br/>     Furious &ndash; The descendant of a fallen angel, the innate bow skills and magical rope of this bloodline make them a force to be reckoned with.<br/>     Ghost Touched &ndash; The descendant of a ghost possessed ancestor, the spark of undead power within this sorcerer grants them a host of ghostly powers.<br/>     Gibbering &ndash; A sorcerer touched by insane and amorphous aberrations.<br/>     Guardian &ndash; Blessed with the blood of an angelic being, a sorcerer with this bloodline has been granted powers to protect and ward other creatures.<br/>     Lich-Spawn &ndash; Their origins in the foul experiments of a lich, the descendants of this bloodline show abilities similar to their progenitors.<br/>     Nymph-Child &ndash; Powers of beauty and grace have been passed down this bloodline.<br/>     School-Born &ndash; The descendant of a line of powerful specialist wizards, this arcane bloodline grants the sorcerer great power over a single school of magic.<br/>     Seducer &ndash; With a succubus or other seducer demon in their bloodline, this sorcerer has the power to always get her way.<br/>     Stone-Born &ndash; Your earth elemental abilities are focused towards the manipulation of stone and rock.<br/>     Vitriolic &ndash; An abyssal sorcerer with the blood of sneaky acid demons.<br/>     Woodchild &ndash; With a tree fey in the family tree, this sorcerer&rsquo;s shows an impressive ability with plants of all kinds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A Bit Of Class: Variant Bloodlines is a class ability sourcebook compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and suitable for GMs and players of any level.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>An innovative system for bringing the magic of the fey realms home to your campaign!<br/><br/>When the realms of mortal folk and immortal fey cross paths, strange and weirdling wonders appear! Sometimes dangerous, sometimes delightful, sometimes both intertwined in a passionate embrace. At least, that is what we want to happen when we bring the fey into a campaign: to create an atmosphere of absolute wonder and mystery. All too often, however, that magical vision in our minds just doesn't come through, and the fey end up as just another monster with a veneer of pretension.<br/><br/>Faerie Mysteries changes all of that with an innovative system of crossing over the warped reality where the influence of the fey makes itself known in the world. These fey impulses vary from rumors that are mostly atmospheric and sensory effects to ripples that disrupt and disturb creatures and objects to full-fledged ruptures that bring rapid and radical change both beautiful and bizarre. This system does for the fey what haunts do for undead, showing how their influence is not limited to simple encounters. That said, Faerie Mysteries also provides a wealth of sample encounters and events focused on the fey and the strange circumstances that may surround a meeting with them or may follow in their wake, and also deals with making subtle variations of existing non-fey creatures to provide unexpected challenges for creatures who think they know it all when it comes to fighting the fey.<br/><br/>Brought to you from the magical minds at Legendary Games, Faerie Mysteries also serves as a sequel to Faerie Passions, providing a rich mechanical supplement to the role-playing concepts and player options presented there. If you're running a campaign where the fey play a significant role, or even if you just want to inject a bit of magical mystery into your game, download this 29-page supplement today and Make Your Game Legendary!<br/><br/>"

        "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Corporia is a tabletop role-playing game of genre-bending fiction and futuristic urban fantasy written by Origins and ENnie award-winning author Mark Plemmons. In Corporia, you take on the roles of reborn Knights of the Round Table or their supernaturally-powered allies, fighting an invisible war for justice in the struggle between otherworldly Chaos magics and the oppressive Order of the ruling mega-corporations!<br/><br/>Corporia is 'knights in shining Armani.' It's what happens when you mix Camelot with a spoonful of Torchwood, add a pinch of cyberpunk, a dash of Joss Whedon's Angel, and a sprinkling of Shadowrun. If you enjoy these, you're going to love Corporia.<br/><br/>From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Corporia is a tabletop role-playing game of genre-bending fiction and futuristic urban fantasy. Play as one of the reborn Knights of the Round Table or one of their supernaturally powered allies, fighting an invisible war against the rise of monsters, magicks, and the powerful mega-corporations that want to control it all.<br/><br/>In the near future&hellip;<br/><br/>Corporations control the world, and Order is the rule of the day. New technologies clean the evironment and raise glittering skyscrapers in outwardly utopian cities, but at the cost of personal freedoms and liberties. It is surely the time foretold in legend, when the Knights of the Round Table would return in the hour of mankind&rsquo;s greatest need.<br/><br/>Yet the Knights are scattered, their memories fragmented, and King Arthur nowhere to be found. Worse, their return breached the barriers of reality, opening portals to the dimensions of Chaos. Now every day brings new horrors as magical anomalies bestow either superhuman abilities or horrible mutations on the populace, monsters spawn in the dark places, spirits return as electronic geists, and software becomes self-aware. The corporations outwardly dismiss these outbreaks as effects of cosmic radiation (aka &sbquo;the Flux&lsquo;) even while waging hidden wars to master this new energy source. Only you and your allies stand for justice in the battle between corporate Order and magical Chaos.<br/><br/>Fortunately, you have powerful benefactors - Sir Lancelot (awakened as a megacorp CEO) and his allies: Sir Percival, the sorceress Nimue, and the artificial intelligence known as M.E.R.L.I.N. As a member of the Knightwatch, Lancelot&rsquo;s secret special operations team, you battle magical monstrosities and augmented humans, dive into living computer networks, infiltrate rival mega-corporations, and more. The only limit is your imagination!<br/><br/>Corporia is designed to make gaming easy, with an intuitive system (2d6 + core value + skill vs. Target Number) that allows for on-the-fly combinations of skills and abilities.<br/><br/>Special Features<br/><br/><br/>    Get ready to play with 13 mix-and-match character options and archetypes for the: Knight-Errant, Badge, Hacker, Headhunter, Journo, Lister, Radical, Runner, Sorcerer, Suit, Thinker, Witcher, and Zero.<br/>    A dynamic spellcasting system of sorcery (holography, kinesis, metamorph, and technomancy) and witchcraft (charm, elemental, perception, and spiritism), with wands as spell-enhancers and magical firearms.<br/>    Group-friendly hacking rules not only let hackers turn technology against itself, but also bring their allies along to battle living computer programs in an infinite variety of digital multi-user dungeons.<br/>    Use 1 private and 3 public traits to gain reality-manipulating &sbquo;Flux Points&lsquo; and create greater character depth.<br/>    Find adventure anywhere in &sbquo;The City&lsquo; with a visitor&rsquo;s guide to 19 districts and 18 mega-corporations.<br/>    Get ready to run with a detailed chapter on game mastery: 6 mini-adventures, 16 cryptids, 25 customizable monstrous assets, 15 relics, city design charts, quick NPC and cryptid generation guides, and information and advice on adventure structure, game balance, corporate secrets, and more!<br/><br/><br/>"

        "description": "Kombat Kittens Game Rules<br/><br/>THE GOAL<br/>Collect the most treasure by battling your kitten compadres and taking their treasure. At the end of the game, the player with the most treasure wins!<br/> THE DECK<br/>80 Kitten Cards: Ten each of ranks 1-7 and ten of rank 9 (There is no rank 8 in Kombat Kittens.) Each card has treasure value from 1 to 4.<br/>Five Dog Cards: Each Dog card has a treasure value of 5. Dogs do not have a rank.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Remove all Dog cards from the deck and deal each player five Kitten cards.<br/> For two players: Deal out three Kitten cards face up in the center of the table - these are the Recruit cards. Add three Dog cards to the remaining deck, each ⅓ of the way through the deck, with the last on the bottom. This is the Draw pile. Place it in the center of the table.<br/> For three to five Players: Deal out one Kitten card face up in the center of the table - this is the Recruit card. Add two Dog cards to the remaining deck, one at the center, and one on the bottom. This is the Draw pile. Place it in the center of the table.<br/> The player with the most realistic &ldquo;meow&rdquo; goes first.<br/><br/>TAKING TURNS<br/>On each turn, the player can either:<br/>1) Draw a card from the Draw pile. (If they have less than seven cards in their hand.)<br/>or<br/>2) Take a Recruit card and replace it with a card from their hand.<br/>or<br/>3) Battle another player: do this by declaring which player you wish to battle.<br/> We recommend passing a turn token (coin, salt shaker, stuffed mouse, etc.) around the table as you play this game. It is always okay to ask how many cards another player has.<br/><br/>Battles<br/>In a battle, both players attempt to make the best three card set from the cards in their hand.  <br/> To indicate they are ready to battle, each player holds their first card face down over the table. When both players are ready, they reveal their cards simultaneously. They repeat this process until three cards have been played (unless a player forfeits, as described below.) After the third card, the best hand is determined and the winner chooses their treasure (see below).<br/><br/>DETERMINING THE WINNER OF A BATTLE<br/>The winner is the player with the best hand based on the hierarchy below, from high to low. If two hands of the same type are played, the one with the highest rank wins.<br/>Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank. Example: 4,4,4 beats 2,2,2 and all straights, pairs and high card hands.<br/>Three Card Straight: Three cards of adjacent rank. Example: 4,5,6 beats 2,3,4 and all pairs and high card hands.<br/>Pair: Two cards of matching rank, plus one other card. For matching pairs, the one with the highest 3rd card wins. Example: 6,6,5 beats 6,6,3 or 4,4,7 and any high card hand.<br/>High Card Hand: A hand without a straight and no pairs. Example: 7,4,3 beats 6,5,2.<br/><br/>TIES<br/>If there is a tie, all players involved in the tied battle discard the played cards and take the number of cards they played from the draw pile instead of drawing up to five cards. No treasure is taken in a tied battle.<br/><br/>CAPTURING TREASURE<br/>At the end of battle, the winning player captures Treasure from the losing player(s) as follows:<br/> Three to Five Player Game: The winner may now take either one card from the losing player&rsquo;s played cards or the lowest value treasure from the losing player&rsquo;s captured treasure. If there are multiple lowest value cards, the winner chooses whichever of these they want.<br/> Two Player Game: The winner takes one of the loser&rsquo;s played cards - they cannot take captured treasure.<br/><br/>AFTER A BATTLE<br/>Once battle is resolved, all uncaptured cards that were played are put into a discard pile, which we call the Litter Box. Then,  all players who participated who have fewer than five cards left, draw new cards until they have a total of five in their hand.<br/> All captured cards are placed face up in front of the player who captured them, so that their treasure value and suit are visible to all. Additionally, if a player forfeited (see below), they draw an extra card now. If a battle ended in a tie, then each of the players in the battle (primary and helper) draw the number of cards they played (three or one).<br/><br/>HELPING<br/>Once a battle has been announced, but before the first card is played, each player involved in the battle may ask for help. If Player B agrees to help Player A, then Player B will play a single card at the end of the battle, after Player A has played their three cards. In a four or five person game, each side in a battle may ask for and receive help. If both sides have a helper, then each helper reveals their card simultaneously after the two main combatants have shown all three cards.<br/><br/>After all cards are played, each side makes their best three card hand out of the four cards available.<br/><br/>Taking treasure: In a helper battle, two cards are taken from the loser. The main combatant on the winning side chooses one card from the played cards (all four cards, if the losing side had a helper) and one card from the main losing combatant&rsquo;s captured treasure. If the main combatant on the losing side has no captured treasure, then the winning side takes two cards from the cards played. Once they&rsquo;ve taken treasure, the winner can choose to give one of those cards to the player who helped them.<br/> Example: Kim announces she will battle Josh. Josh and Kim both ask for help. Mike agrees to help Kim, and Vivian agrees to help Josh. Kim and Josh then simultaneously reveal three cards from their hand in sequence. Mike and Vivian then both reveal a card from their hand. Kim&rsquo;s side ends up with 5,5,5,7 and Josh&rsquo;s side ends with 4,5,6,7. Kim&rsquo;s side wins, because she has three 5&rsquo;s which beats Josh&rsquo;s hand of 5,6,7.<br/> Kim then takes one card from Josh&rsquo;s captured treasure, and one of the four cards played (one of the 4,5, 6 or 7).  Although she could add both cards to her own treasure, she gives Mike one of the two as a reward for helping her.<br/><br/>FORFEITING<br/>Either of the main combatants in a battle may forfeit after playing their first or second card. Players who are receiving help can forfeit as well, but even if they do, the helper must play a card. Cards played by the forfeiting player or their helper are subject to being taken by the winner, just as in any other battle.<br/> If a player forfeits, they are allowed to take an additional card from the Draw Pile after the battle. If they are left with fewer than five cards at the end of battle, they first draw until they have five cards then take their additional card. Helpers on the forfeiting side may not take an additional card. They only take new cards if they have less than five in their hand at the end of battle.<br/><br/>DOGFIGHTS<br/>If at any point during play a player draws a Dog card from the deck, they immediately place it face up in the center of the table and a Dogfight commences. (Before the Dogfight, the player who drew the Dog draws a new card and any other players who were in mid-draw should finish drawing.)<br/> Players must play at least one card in the Dogfight, but they may forfeit after playing their first or second card. The winner of the Dogfight takes the Dog card and places it face up in front of them in their captured treasure. As in normal battle, all players select a card and hold it face down over the table, then reveal their cards at once. Unlike a normal battle, players may not ask for help.<br/> The Dogfight ends when either a) all players but one have forfeited, or b) all players who are still in the Dogfight have played three cards. In the case of Ties, the Dog is discarded, and all players who played three cards take three cards from the draw pile.<br/> As with normal battle, any players who forfeit the Dogfight battle draw an extra card at the end of the battle and all players who have fewer than five cards draw until they have five.<br/><br/>REACHING THE END OF THE DECK<br/>Two Players: At the end of the first deck, there will be a single Dogfight (the bottom card is always a Dog) and then the game is over.<br/> Three to Five Players: At the end of the first deck, after the Dogfight, take all the discarded cards from the Litter Box and reshuffle them. Then add the last three Dogs to this deck, each card roughly ⅓ of the way through the deck with the last Dog on the bottom of the deck. When you reach the end of the second deck there will be one final Dogfight and then the game is over.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>Two players: The game ends after the Dogfight at the end of the first deck.<br/>Three to Five players: The game ends after the Dogfight at the end of the second deck.<br/> Note: If any player has fewer than five cards or needs to draw cards due to a previous battle, then shuffle the discards from the Litter Box and draw cards before the final Dogfight.<br/><br/>DETERMINING A WINNER<br/>At the end of the game, each player adds up the treasure value of all cards in their captured treasure (the ones face up in front of them) and adds any Suit Bonuses (as described below). The player with the highest total wins! They should be patted on the head and given a treat.<br/><br/>SUIT BONUSES<br/>A player who has four or more treasure cards of the same suit receives a 10 point bonus at the end of the game. Players receive this bonus once per suit of which they have four or more cards.<br/> Example: If a player has four captured Samurai kittens, they get 10 bonus points. If they have eight captured Samurai, they still get just 10 bonus points. However, if they have four captured Samurai and four captured Mechs, they get a 20 point bonus (10 for each suit).<br/> If two or more players tie for the the highest treasure score, the tied players play a three-card hand after first drawing to make sure have at least five cards in their hands. The player with the best hand is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 3400 AD, mankind has colonized the Pleiad star cluster where mighty corporations vie for control and influence. Each player equips fleets with escort ships and upgrades and uses them to control star systems for VPs. Diplomatic leverage, cunning, and brute force will determine the victor.<br/><br/>Each round in Fleets: The Pleiad Conflict consists of six phases:<br/><br/>1) Player order. Every round has a new randomized player order. Being first has its pros and cons, so does being last.<br/><br/>2) Build. The players take turn buying new fleets, escort ships, and upgrades, using their megacredits. The fleets each consist of a flagship and space for some combinations of escort ships and upgrade cards. Which fleet you choose and how you develop it will determine its strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>3) Deployment. The players place their fleets at the different systems they want to control.<br/><br/>4) Diplomacy. Players take turns using diplomatic actions. There are 2 basic actions: A) Use 2 diplomatic points to retreat your fleet from the board. B) Use 6 diplomatic points to retreat an opposing fleet from a system where you have a fleet. There are also diplomatic actions on some fleets, systems, and action cards.<br/><br/>5) Battle. At every system with more than one fleet there will be a battle where every ship gets to shoot once. Each fleet has different initiative numbers for its ships, describing when they get to act. Late ships risk being shot down before they have a chance to fire. During battle, players can also use battle actions on action cards, upgrade cards, fleets, and escort ships. Most battle actions cost energy from the fleet. If a flagship is destroyed, its owner must immediately retreat all surviving escort ships from that battle and discard the fleet.<br/><br/>6) Reward. Players get 1 VP for each system they have to themselves (The first player to reach 7 VP is the winner.). Then each fleet gets energy from its reactor and resources from the system where they are located. Then each player gets 2 diplomatic points, 6 megacredits, and an action card, and then the next round can begin.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A version of Monopoly Junior based on the Disney movie Planes. Collect the most and best characters (properties), and earn the most fuel (money) to win.<br/><br/>The board is 7 x 7, with 4 characters (properties) per side, two per color, plus the standard Go, Free Parking, Go to Jail and Jail corners, and finally 2 &quot;Race Challenges&quot; and 2 &quot;Prize Fund&quot; locations (where the railroads would be, but correspond to the Community Chest or Chance cards in the original game). Race Challenges will often have you contribute money to the Prize Fund, which then goes to the next person who lands on those locations.<br/><br/>When the game begins, each location has a corresponding card placed on it. As each player lands on those locations and &quot;buys&quot; them, they take the card and mark the location on the board with one of their 10 hangars (houses/hotels, sort of, but that simply mark ownership of locations on the board). Then like in classic Monopoly, other players must pay the fuel cost for that location if they land there.<br/><br/>Variants on the basic game allow for monopoly pricing, scoring per the fuel cost on each card (property) instead of simply 1 point per card, and card (property) swaps.<br/><br/>"

Blocks will disappear when four or more of the same color are touching. New blocks appear along the top and drop down to the game board. Some blocks have a lock on them. Any row that contains a Lock cannot be moved. Locks are eliminated when matched with other blocks of the same color, and they are worth more points than regular blocks. Falling Star blocks are worth the most points. Match four or more just as you would any other color. But be careful! They are called Falling Stars because if they reach the bottom row, they will fall through it and be lost. Whenever sets of matching blocks disappear, the blocks above them drop down to fill in the gaps. When falling blocks cause more matching sets to disappear, or if multiple sets of blocks are eliminated at the same time, you&rsquo;ll get a combo bonus.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;re in danger when the height of the blocks reaches the top row and the new set has no room to fall. When this happens, the top row will flash red for five seconds, and if the next row down is not cleared by then, it&rsquo;s game over!<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"

In addition to the standard property acquisition and collecting payment from opponents, players can fight monsters and develop their characters. Getting on certain cells of the field, players can start a battle with monsters and get treasures, which will improve their fighting skills.  The measure of fighting abilities is the level. Clashes between players are also possible: 2 players need just to be on the same sector. A mechanism of a fight is simple: the opponents roll a D6, add the number to their level value (that can be improved with artifacts) and the highest sum is the winner! In case of a defeat players don't die. The worst that can happen is the loss of a certain amount of money. Most powerful artifacts the player can receive for the victory over the dragon help you to make your rivals go broke, but do not play a critical role: if someone is doing bad he goes bankrupt anyway and prosperous player can afford to lose a couple of hundred.<br/><br/>"

The game is worth buying at least for the illustrations on the cards: very vividly depicted representatives of the Russian criminal world.<br/>Also the cards have classical card suits on them. So you can play classical card games with one of the decks, if you want to.<br/><br/>The game consists of two decks - fighters and property. Each card has a toughness value. If the toughness of the fighter is higher than the toughness of the property, he can capture it and become it's guard. The owner of that fighter becomes the owner of the property. Another player can try to seize neutral property or someone else's property by attacking the guard. All fighter cards have different special abilities on them. At the beginning of the game players assign trumps. And during the game only the trump suit can use card abilities. When at some point of the game any player possesses a curtain amount of property he is declared the winner and the game ends.<br/><br/>Русское описание:<br/>&laquo;Большой куш&raquo; &mdash; это игра про рейдерские захваты 90-х, которая выполнена в потрясающем &laquo;блатном&raquo; антураже и с весьма узнаваемыми персонажами.

Её стоит купить хотя бы ради иллюстраций на картах: столь колоритно изображены представители отечественного криминального мира.<br/><br/>"

Samurai Robots Battle Royale can be played on an average dinner table using any models you already own, including toy robots and paper figures, in any scale.<br/><br/>Samurai Robots Battle Royale and our kaiju game Mighty Monsters are compatible, so you can run mechas vs giant monsters battles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Warhammer 40,000: Conquest, a two-player Living Card Game, you take the part of a warlord, leading your armies into battle against your opponent in a bid to claim glorious victory. Even as you lead your bravest warriors into battle, you must plan for the future, establishing a presence on planets before the tides of war consume them in blood and fire. You must conquer the Traxis sector by strength of arms for in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.<br/><br/>Warhammer 40,000: Conquest introduces seven distinct factions: Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, Chaos, Dark Eldar, Eldar, and Tau. Each of these factions possesses a unique flavor and style of play, and an alignment wheel introduces the possibility of forming an alliance between two factions.<br/><br/>At the start of play, the Traxis sector lies open before you, with planets awaiting the tramp of armies on the road to war. Each round begins with you and your opponent preparing for battle. Planet cards are arranged in a row between the players at the beginning of the game, and the planet farthest to the left of the starting player is the first planet. Each round, you or your opponent will clash at the first planet, and the victor will capture the first planet.<br/><br/>Capturing planets is your ultimate goal. Some planets possess essential materials necessary for the armies of the 41st millennium. Others offer strategic advantages to those who hold them, while yet others are home to great technological wealth. Each of the planet cards possesses one or more symbols in the upper left hand corner, designating that planet's assets. These symbols grant no abilities by themselves, but the first player to collect three planets sharing a common symbol dominates the sector and wins the game.<br/><br/>Your warlord grants powerful special abilities, determines your starting resources and hand size, and serves as a vital part of your army, so you'll want to build your deck around your warlord to take full advantage of his strengths &mdash; and cover his weaknesses, as defeating the opponent's warlord is another way to victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>Inspired by classic modules such as Tomb of Horrors, Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth, Ghost Tower of Inverness, Into the Unknown and more obscure favorites such as Buffalo Castle and the Deathtrap Equalizer Dungeon.<br/><br/>Cover picture by the great Erol Otus; originally printed on the back jacket of Keep on the Borderlands.<br/><br/>The locals won't speak of it. Animals shun it. Adventurers share whispered rumors about it over the campfire's last embers. It is Castle Farkinwald. Built long ago by an intensely perverse wizard named Farkinwald the Fantastic, the castle that bears his name occupies a lonely mountain range in the middle of an uninhabited plain. Farkinwald never stirs from his lair giving rise to the notion every ten years or so that he&rsquo;s finally passed away, leaving his piles of incalculable wealth unattended. Adventurers, braggarts and drunks, fired by visions of becoming as wealthy as sultans, invariably risk everything to explore the truth of these rumors, never to return. The only question that matters however is: will *you* dare to brave the forlorn fastnesses of Castle Farkinwald?<br/><br/>This dungeon is supposed to kill you. Don't be discouraged by dying early, often and gruesomely. It's not intended to be fair; sometimes you will be killed simply for taking the wrong Hindrances or Edges. That's the way Farkinwald rolls.<br/><br/>Castle Farkinwald is intended to work with whatever swords-and-sorcery setting you'd like to run. Feel free to adapt it as you need to so that it will fit within your campaign of choice.<br/><br/>Why even attempt a dungeon like this? Well, it was designed as a one-shot so if you're just looking for something ridiculous to play with your gaming buddies for a night, this'll give you some laughs. If you're of a more serious frame of mind, you can play this tournament style and see who amasses the most points by the end of the night. If your campaign allows for easy resurrection magic, you could place this dungeon in your world as a sort of &quot;sports dungeon&quot; that adventurers go through while fans watch via crystal balls and other divination magic.<br/><br/>"

Spend too long in any tavern or listen to a village alewife and you&rsquo;ll hear stories of knights and wodewose duking it out in little patches of now cleared pastures.<br/><br/>One of these little villages is the village of Levnec, a sad little town ruled by a self appointed lord banished from his seaside villa far to the south. His name is Lord Kristoph and he has been looking to hire some transient sell swords to solve his problem. Some of the townsfolk are (repeatedly) going missing and others are refusing to work, even after examples were beaten and hobbled by his men. Seeing as the townsfolk are blaming the local Gnomes, he would simply like these drifters to saunter in the wood, murder some Gnomes and bring them back to show the townsfolk there is nothing to fear (except him) and to get back to work.<br/><br/>designer's comment:<br/>The adventure The Gnomes of Levnec has now also been updated to include professional art, layout and cartography by Jez Gordon.  It also is now dual statted for both NGR and OSR games.<br/><br/>"

It switched to follow the Holy Church about a generation ago, throwing off their ties to the Old Gods (mostly). There are some hold outs. Recently however, tales of demon worship and witchcraft have begun to flourish, leading the young and inexperienced priest to enter a panic.<br/><br/>The town is at a crossroads and the players can influence what happens to the very souls of the town&rsquo;s inhabitants. Will they let the witches and warlocks rule the night? Crush the pagans once and for all? Overthrow the oppressive Holy Church or perhaps just keep everyone from killing each other and hopefully get along?<br/><br/>The answer is probably whichever one occurs as a side effect of stripping the place of everything valuable that isn&rsquo;t nailed down.<br/><br/>Designer's comment:<br/>As some of you are no doubt already aware,  the adventure A Thousand Dead Babies has been updated to include professional art, layout and cartography by Jez Gordon.  It also includes a dungeon that was previously only hinted at.<br/><br/>"

Playing &ldquo;ZnajZank&rdquo; makes it unbelievably easy to remember the most important figures, dates, places and objects in Polish modern history.<br/><br/>ZnajZnak - Monte Cassino is an educational game for two players thanks to which memorizing facts about one of the most important battles of World War II comes incredibly easy. You learn while having a great time playing it. Players get to know selected soldiers, unit badges, weapons used in the battle and most important dates. The 133 symbols placed on the game cards were carefully selected to show the Battle of Monte Cassino in a wide international perspective emphasizing the heroic efforts of Polish as well as the allied forces. The manual and game cards are bilingual Polish-English.<br/><br/>ZnajZnak &ndash; Monte Cassino includes 10 cards on each of which 12 different symbols have been placed. Every two cards have a common symbol. Your job is to find and name it as fast as you can. If you don&rsquo;t recognize your symbol flip your card and read the information on the other side. Then place a new card on the table and go on with the game. If you manage to name your symbol you should give your card to the other player. The first player to get rid of all his cards wins.<br/><br/>ZnajZnak Monte Cassino is available in 13 collector&rsquo;s versions labeled with letters from A to N. Every box is a complete game set. You can mix card sets because they always match.<br/><br/>",

The card combos available in Munchkin Panic are created from a unique mixing of the decks of the two source games. Each defeated monster becomes a trophy and gives up its treasure to the victor. If players work together to defeat the monsters, the player with the highest point count becomes Master Munchkin &mdash; but players must balance their self-interest with the cooperation necessary to survive. If players get too greedy, the monsters will stomp the castle flat while the players are too busy fighting amongst themselves!<br/><br/>",

What you&rsquo;ll find here are rules, ideas, and examples lovingly crafted by the fans of the game, edited and compiled together for clarity and coherence. Many of the articles here can be found in unedited form on fan-run Serenity RPG forums and websites, especially the excellent Waves in the Black site and its successor [the Cortex System RPG site].<br/><br/>The authors of this work range in experience from dedicated players and GMs to some of the playtesters and developers of the game, but the level of quality here is universally high. Hopefully, within these pages you will be able to find sources of inspiration for encounters, adventures, or even whole campaigns &mdash; and characters, rules, and ideas to enrich those journeys!<br/><br/>"

If the result is a number, the player moves any character forward by that number of tiles. If it shows the dragon, s/he moves the dragon by one tile. If the dragon ever reaches the princess, the two of them move together from now on. If the black hat is rolled, a card is flipped over: It shows the character that has to move one tile forward.

For three determination tokens, he can take a special gathering action once on every mythos icon of the island tiles, to resolve one trap, or treasure from the mythos deck.<br/><br/>The sailor has some tricks to conserve food. For 2 determination tokens, he can change one food into one non-rotting food.<br/><br/>The sailor is also tough. He can discard 1 determination token to re-roll an injury die (brown, grey or green).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Lock 'n Load franchise comes to the PC with Lock 'n Load: Heroes of Stalingrad. Designed by Mark H. Walker and programmed by elements of the team responsible for bringing you Panzer General Online, Heroes of Stalingrad remains faithful to Lock' 'n Load's ease of play and immersive format, while incorporating all the advantages of playing on your office flatscreen.<br/><br/>The game features two, branching campaigns with a total of 33 scenarios (15 Soviet and 18 German) based on the battles for Stalingrad. One that is playable from the Soviet side and one from the German point of view. The campaigns are story driven, using graphic novel-type panels to propel the plot. A turn-based game, Heroes of Stalingrad retains Lock 'n Load's engaging impulse system while adding features, such as flanking fire, hidden units, and residual machine gun fire, that would just be too fiddly for the boardgame.<br/><br/>In each campaign gamers will not only need their tactical wits as the fight company-sized battles in, and on the approaches to, Stalingrad, but will also need to manage their troops in the campaign interface. It is in the campaign interface that they decide who to take into to battle, how to spend their precious resource points, and whether to lead a tank-heavy force, vulnerable to enemy infantry in the streets of Stalingrade, or a less mobile, infantry only, contingent.<br/><br/>Heroes of Stalingrad ships with 15 stand alone missions for those who want to jump right in to the fighting. There are bridge seizures, Partisan ambushes, and even a reprisal of several of the scenarios from Lock 'n Load Publishing's fast-selling Not One Step Back.<br/><br/>Fully integrated multiplayer support means easy player matching, no extra configuration required and seamless head to head play with 9 balanced multiplayer scenarios.<br/><br/>As you have come to expect from Lock &lsquo;n Load Publishing, the art is superb. David Julien, Marc von Martial, Nicolas Eskubi, Gabriel Gendron, Guillaume Ries and Pete Abrams have combined to make soldiers, tanks, and maps that pull you into the conflict and won&rsquo;t let go. An engaging soundtrack written and performed by Jeff Edwards adds to the immersion. The game includes, Soviet Guards, Rumanians, Partisans, and about a quarter-jillion types of German squads, not to mention (but we will) MG34s, DP28, T-34s, T70s, PzIIIj, on and on.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"

Your goal is to build the most efficient hospital in three dimensions in order to get the most popularity. You will manage the construction of the building from scratch as well as the installation of new services and the recruitment of the best doctors, nurses and administrative staff that align with the arrival of new patients. You will also be attentive to the well-being of patients and not forget that time is also money when competing with neighboring hospitals...<br/><br/>Each turn in Clinic, players take three actions &mdash; building in different modules; hosting patients; hiring doctors, nurses and staff &mdash; by playing one card. Each cube that enters the clinic comes with a car that needs to be parked, leaving less space for the hospital being constructed! During the game, you'll move patients, doctors, nurses, and staff in the 3D structure as efficiently as you can in order to save time, with doctors and nurses tending to patients as long as their colors (indicating both training and illness) match. By taking care of patients you receive money, which lets you pay fees, salaries and maintenance as well as buy popularity points.<br/><br/>During an administrative phase, uncared for patients grow sicker, new patients enter the pre-admission room, doctors become less knowledgable about the diseases they face, and new doctors and nurses become available from their schools. In the end, the player with the most popularity points and least time spent during the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Cabin in the Wilderness includes a single page of twelve figure flats for use with the cabin including eight unarmed men, a female hunter, a male and female cop, and a monstrous brute. Cabin in the Wilderness also includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center room of the cabin.<br/><br/>Cabin in the Wilderness is intended for use in horror or post apocalyptic modern games.<br/><br/>Finally there is a small Adventure for Savage Worlds included (The map and the figure flats can still be used with any system) starting with the below Adventure Hook.<br/><br/>Nature&rsquo;s Vengeance: A couple was once murdered in this cabin. Now rumors say the place is haunted and no one goes up there anymore. But a group of drug dealers decide it would be the perfect place to make drugs where the cops are unlikely to bother them. Their presence in the cabin angers a horrific avenger of nature that awakes from a nearby tree. A monster huntress has come to take on the rumored monster that lives in the woods. And the cops might be tailing the drug dealers&hellip;<br/><br/>How do the Player Characters figure into all this?  They could be Ghost Hunters here to find out about the ghosts and put them to rest. They could be Monster Hunters that are rivals to the huntress and have heard the rumors of a monster that lives in these woods. They could be Detectives trying to bust the drug dealers with backup from the police. No matter what their motive for being here, they are about to encounter an entire web of complications&hellip;continued inside.<br/><br/>"

A roll-to-hit system enables air and (optional) naval combat to scale from the small dogfights of the Fokker Scourge to the mighty clash of dreadnoughts at Jutland. On land, corps entrench by flipping which opens up an in-hex dimension for every trench battle to simulate the tactical ebb and flow that animated the front even during strategic &quot;stalemate&quot;.<br/><br/>Since victory hinges on territorial control, the opposing sides feed men into the mill hoping to win a war of attrition before accumulated demoralization triggers a domestic political crisis to upset their balance. The prospect of a &quot;breakthrough&quot; to the green fields beyond motivates ceaseless attacks, but it's ephemeral until tanks and planes arrive in numbers. The presence of specific admirals and generals, including the U-boat ace Lothar von Arnauld de la Periere, makes the game personal.<br/><br/>A haggle-based diplomacy system enables history buffs to recreate the land-swap politics of the period, or players can opt for a simpler, streamlined schedule of neutral entry with a dash of randomness added for surprise. Production is as simple as 1-2-3 to avoid excessive math while enabling players to comprehend the &quot;cost&quot; of their losses.

There are 21 different animals, including &quot;Man,&quot; and they range from the lowly mosquito to the mighty Lion.<br/><br/>The game is played in days and each day, players take turns either asking another player a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; question (in a quest to learn the identity of that player's animal) or attacking another player's animal (if they believe their animal is stronger that day). When an attack occurs, the player with the more powerful animal ON THAT DAY wins the attack and stays in the game. The losing animal is revealed to all and the player with that animal is out of the game. The game continues until.  only one player/animal remains and is declared King of the Jungle.<br/><br/>While each animal has a usual strength (i.e., the Frog (3), the Crocodile (12), the Lion (20)), each day comes with a different condition (i.e., flood, monsoon, drought, Beautiful Day). The condition of a day can change the strength of some of the animals. For example, while the Lion (20) on most days is more powerful than most animals when the jungle is flooded, the strength of the Crocodile rises to 21 and on this day can defeat the Lion. Learning which player has which animal, how to keep the identity of your animal a secret,and when to attack another player's animal are all key components to becoming King.<br/><br/>To enhance the strategic element, play with Advantage Cards (included). A &quot;Sneak Attack&quot; Advantage Card will increase the strength of an attacking animal by 5. A &quot;Run Away&quot; Advantage Card will allow an animal to run away from an attack but not before learning the identity of the attacking animal. There are six different Advantage Cards.<br/><br/>This fun and hilarious game of deception, deceit, and deduction challenges a player's memory and teaches one how to ask pointed questions. More information and where to buy can be found on the official website (<a target='_blank' href='http://www.KingOfTheJungleGame.com).Great' rel='nofollow'>www.KingOfTheJungleGame.com).Great</a> fun for kids, adults, adults with kids, and large groups and it can be played with up to 21 players at once! Enjoy and good luck on becoming King!<br/><br/>"

        "description": "A simple worker placement game based on the conquest of fictional and humorously named territories using a deck of coins as a random agent. Players take turns placing coins from their hands onto the map based on a simple set of rules with the goal of capturing coins that have already been situated on the map.<br/><br/>Coins are never flipped in this game, and the random element is determined by the pool of coins used to play. Thus every game is different and strategy varies based on the coins available. The length of the game is also determined by the deck of coins - when the pool is exhausted, the game ends.<br/><br/>Despite the geographical suggestion of the art, the game is not about conquering territories from neighboring territories, but involves planning ahead and placing coins to capture the most coins for yourself, while not creating an advantageous position for your opponent(s). Coins are captured based on comparative sizes of the coins (sometimes smaller, sometimes larger) and simple rules that are written on the territories.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "As Hitler's grasp on Germany tightens and his maniacal fervor is unmasked, men from the highest levels of the Reich begin to plot his assassination. As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot;, the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?<br/><br/>Black Orchestra begins with each player choosing a historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).<br/><br/>But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.<br/><br/>On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions &mdash; at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling &quot;Conspire&quot; action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.<br/><br/>After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.<br/><br/>To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator &amp; fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of &quot;Target&quot; symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any &quot;Eagles&quot; rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.<br/><br/>Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of it's cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.<br/><br/>",

At any time, a player may spend one of their two veto chips to veto another player's move, announcing a new restriction under which that move is illegal (such as &quot;players may not move more than six stations in a turn&quot;). In doing so, the players gradually build a set of restrictions for how the game is to be played. Play continues until a player is able to reach Mornington Crescent without having their move vetoed.<br/><br/>By framing all discussion of additional rules as mere &quot;reminders&quot; of a deeper, undisclosed ruleset, the game appears to an audience to be a fully-formed boardgame rather than something that the players are largely inventing on the fly.<br/><br/>"

For long months he had retained his people's allegiance by branding his enemies as barbaric invaders, as marauders whose only goal was to plunder and ravage his empire. But now reports were spreading that these invaders were rebuilding their conquered worlds and adorning them with marvelous advancements. Moreover, many of the realm's greatest heroes were flocking to his enemies' side, and their heroic exploits were fast becoming the stuff of popular legend.<br/><br/>The situation had worsened. This was no longer a mere incursion into his territory, a simple uprising to be quelled. The galaxy now stood at the threshold of something far greater, something far more dangerous. And his people dared to embrace it! But he would make his people suffer, even if his retaliation ended in the devastation of entire worlds. He would not allow his kingdom to betray him with impunity, even if he was ultimately powerless to stem the tide of the coming REVOLUTION!<br/><br/>Core Worlds: Revolution allows players to delve deeper into the story of the Core Worlds universe. Players will be able to build incredible Advancements on their conquered Worlds, including Cosmic Terraformers, Wormhole Generators, and Dark Energy Power Cores. Players will also be able to employ Heroic Tactics keyed to specific Heroes, such as Baron Viktor's &quot;Sacrificial Lambs&quot;, the Promethean Cyborg's &quot;Accelerated Procurement,&quot; and Queen Alais's &quot;Warrior Queen.&quot; Each Hero will command 3 unique Heroic Tactics kept in a separate Heroic Deck beside the players' regular draw decks. The expansion also features 3 new Heroes (Captain Alexander, the Prophet, and Duke Magnus), each complete with his own set of Heroic Tactics.<br/><br/>Core Worlds: Revolution includes nearly 100 new cards that magnify the richness and excitement of the Core Worlds universe!<br/><br/>",

Water shugenja are among the Empire&rsquo;s most peaceful but also some of the most dangerous to enrage. Water is a source of clarity and vision, empowering divination and assisting magistrates. It is the source of life but also the inspiration of the battlefield general; the Element of motion and movement, but also the essential Element of serenity and peace.<br/><br/>The Book of Water is the fourth in the series of Elemental sourcebooks for the Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game. Each book explores different aspects of Rokugan&rsquo;s world and samurai culture from the standpoint of the chosen Element. This book explores the aspects of Water, from the flowing grace of a warrior fighting with a bo staff to the ruthless tactics of merchants who exploit the flows of travel and coin. Within these pages may be found:<br/><br/>A discussion of the weapons of Water, including staves, chain weapons, and peasant weapons, as well as Mizu-do (the martial art of Water) and naval warfare.<br/><br/>The courtly and diplomatic arts of Water, with a particular focus on commerce.<br/><br/>The power and nature of Water magic, including many new spells of the Element.<br/><br/>New Water Kiho and Water-oriented monastic schools.<br/><br/>A new campaign setting, the Eternal Danger Islands, an archipelago filled with both danger and opportunity.<br/><br/>And much more!<br/><br/>"

Choose from the Swashbuckler, the Sea Dog, the Ninja Shadow, the Ninja Sword, the Shaman, the Hunter and the Sorcerer -- all with their own powers and abilities. Imperials, DINO-PIRATES, ninjas and natives all in the mix. We tweaked the armor rules a bit, since heroes in DINO-PIRATES OF NINJA ISLAND are more swashbuckly, less clompy and stompy.<br/><br/>The DINO-PIRATES OF NINJA ISLAND setting isn't tied to a particular mechanic, and the rules aren't meant to model physical laws. Rather, the rules (both the &quot;classic&quot; DINO-PIRATES and these Old School rules) are meant to provide a structure in which interesting stories are likely to happen. So why not supply multiple rulesets? If you like one more than the other, that doesn't make you a bad person. Try 'em both!<br/><br/>All you need to do is download the original Old School Hack rules from Kirin's site, then download the DPoNI substitution for the DINO-PIRATE-y classes and abilities. Then yaaaarrrrr! You're ready for adventure among the islands!<br/><br/>user comment:<br/>This initial version of the DPoNI OSH rules has no art, except the DPoNI logo, and depends on the Old School Hack rules for additional information.<br/><br/>"

You really can't beat Old School Hack for super-easy game mastering.<br/><br/>But we also really kind of sneakily LOVE filling out forms. We're addicted to character sheets, and have spent many long hours poring over how to fill out every field in our Campaign Planning Guide, and other such treasures. It's one of the things we've always cherished about tabletop role-playing games, and we wanted to make sure that the new DINO-PIRATES OF NINJA ISLAND provided some of that love for the DM, not just the players.<br/><br/>So check out these fantastic Location and NPC sheets!<br/><br/>Easy-to-print, half-page forms that help you keep your notes organized, even if you're making them up during play! Keep track of minions and bad guys, potential treasure or secrets to be discovered. Have your bad guys easily statted up before the big combat, or make them up on the fly and keep track so they're consistent for next time.<br/><br/>You never know, your players MIGHT notice.<br/><br/>Anyway, you'll have fun filling them in, and hopefully the process of doing so helps you think through your next encounter so you're better-prepared than ever!<br/><br/>"

The idea of the game has is to be the first to 1 million Rand (the currency of South Africa). This is done by moving round the board, drawing cards and sometimes having to answer questions related to different countries. The card also has an amount on it in the thousands which is then converted to Rands using the exchange rate of the land you just moved onto. There is also then a multiplier done based on the colour of the square you landed on. There are also Action and Bonus squares giving you a 2 &amp; 3 times bounces. You keep doing this and the first person to 1 million Rand wins.<br/><br/>"

Antique trinkets and artifacts lie within its ever-changing walls, but the ravens that watch the manor are insufficient to discourage treasure hunters and bandits. A new guardian has awoken, and dark forces gather to his aid. Left unchecked, the power and size of this creature will never stop expanding. Its potential is limitless, and it must be stopped.<br/><br/>Manor of Ravens, an expansion for Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition), invites you to travel to a haunted manor house and battle the guardian that waits within. The overlord gains a host of new material in this expansion, including two new classes of Overlord cards, new monsters, and deadly new relics that can be wielded by monsters. The overlord even gains his first servant: a creature that can be summoned into play, similar to the heroes' familiar. The heroes also receive powerful new assets in Manor of Ravens, gaining access to two new heroes as well as new hero classes for Warriors and Scouts.<br/><br/>A new lieutenant also enters the scene as the heroes attempt to investigate the manor house. Skarn is a magical construct, composed of pieces of the manor house and possessed of limitless potential. If Skarn is not stopped, he could continue to grow and eventually overwhelm the world. Only your heroes stand between this magical creature and the demise of Terrinoth.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Despite its American inspired name, Chicago has its roots in Sweden and is one of the most popular traditional card games in the country. It has an endless number of variations, so the summary below will deal with the most common rules in use today.<br/><br/>Chicago is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The object of the game is to score points by having the best poker hand. Each poker hand is assigned a point value (p), as follows:<br/><br/>1p &mdash; One Pair: Two cards of the same rank (e.g.: A, 10, 10, 6, 2).<br/>2p &mdash; Two Pair: Two pairs of different ranks (e.g.: K, K, J, 4, 4).<br/>3p &mdash; Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank (e.g.: Q, Q, Q, 9, 6).<br/>4p &mdash; Straight: Five cards in rank sequence (e.g.: J, 10, 9, 8, 7).<br/>5p &mdash; Flush: Five cards of the same suit (e.g.: A, J, 10, 7, 3; all diamonds).<br/>6p &mdash; Full House: Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (e.g.: Q, Q, Q, 9, 9). <br/>7p &mdash; Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same rank (e.g.: J, J, J, J, 8).<br/>9p &mdash; Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (e.g.: J, 10, 9, 8, 7; all diamonds).<br/><br/>Points are also awarded for taking the last trick of each round (5 points), or for scoring a &quot;Chicago&quot; by taking all five tricks of the round (15 or 25 points, must be declared by calling &quot;Chicago&quot; before any trick is played).<br/><br/>The first player to reach a pre-determined number of points (typically 50, 52, or 100) wins the game.<br/><br/>Common scoring variants include awarding an automatic &quot;Chicago&quot; for a holder of a straight flush instead of the normal points awarded for that hand at the end of the round. Others award points equal to the game goal (50, 52, or 100) if the straight flush is also &quot;Royal&quot; (meaning, ranks A, K, Q, J, 10).<br/><br/>Playing a round<br/><br/>Each player (including the dealer) is dealt 5 cards after which 3 phases follow. Before each phase, the players are allowed to discard any unwanted cards face down to the central playing area and are dealt an equal number of replacement cards.<br/><br/>First and Second Phase<br/><br/>Each player may now declare any poker hand which they hold (honor system). Highest hand scores points according to the value of the poker hand combination. The other players do not score. In the case of a tie, highest card used to score the hand wins (highest triple in the event of a full house). If still tied, highest non-scoring card breaks the tie. If still tied, each tied player scores full points.<br/><br/>Variant: If you scored a poker hand, but discard at least one of the scoring cards before the next phase, you must simply announce that you are &quot;not keeping&quot; your hand.<br/><br/>Third Phase<br/><br/>The player to the left of the dealer leads out by playing a card in front of themselves. Each other player must follow suit, if able. The winner of the trick leads out the following trick, and so on.<br/><br/>It is important for all players to keep their own cards separated from other player cards. All played cards should be clearly visible to all players.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the first trick, and only during the first trick, before a player has played their card, they may call &quot;Chicago&quot;. Should this happen, all players gather any cards they played back into their hand (as applicable) and the player who called &quot;Chicago&quot; will lead out instead. In order to score a successful &quot;Chicago&quot;, all five tricks must be won, no exceptions.<br/><br/>Round Scoring<br/><br/>The winner of the fifth and last trick scores 5 points (variant: score 10 points if you won the trick with a 2). As was done during the first two phases, the best poker hand also scores. If a successful &quot;Chicago&quot; was played, no other points are scored. A failed &quot;Chicago&quot; instead results in the caller receiving a score penalty equal to the points normally awarded (-15 or -25 points). A cumulative negative score is possible.<br/><br/>At the end of scoring, if any player has reached the pre-determined final score, the game ends. Otherwise, or in the event of a tie, play continues. Deal passes to the left. The entire deck is re-shuffled before the initial deal each round.<br/><br/>"

The game uses a new OpenCL system based on the Unity 3D engine to allow players to change the terrain in anyway, create new objects in any form, and do it anywhere.<br/><br/>In Planet Explorers, it is the year 2287, one of the first colony ships sent out by Earth arrives at the planet Maria, in the Epsilon Indi Star System. During its landing sequence, something appears in front of the massive ship that causes it to lose control and crash into the planet. Some of the colonists survive in lifeboats, but what they find is an unforgiving land filled with creatures ready to outlast the visitors from Earth. Now the survivors must explore, gather, build, create, fight, and ultimately, conquer the land.<br/><br/>The gameplay will be in 3rd and 1st person perspectives. Players will be able to customize their character, combine and create weapons, vehicles, and buildings. At the same time, players will have to defeat multitudes of enemies of varying intelligence and defend the remnants of the colonists. There will also be a mission system that features NPCs giving the player goals to achieve to advance the storyline. The game will feature a single player story line as well as random single and multiplayer adventure maps. Multiplayer will feature prominently in Planet Explorers.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"

Bloober Team's main inspirations were old classics like Spy vs. Spy and Bomberman, and gameplay revolves around setting up traps (self-detonated or activated by characters approaching it or stepping on it without noticing) to hurt other players. It&rsquo;s focused on multiplayer, but basic single player campaigns with bots to fill in for missing characters will be available too.<br/><br/>Basement Crawl is a 2.5D game with dynamic cameras &ndash; to the game modes, characters and mechanics. &quot;We felt that many games nowadays are dependent on character development or luck and randomness, so we designed Basement Crawl to exclude the luck factor and remove the dependence on leveling-up characters. We want to make Basement Crawl as skill-based as possible and focus on hardcore players instead of casual or &lsquo;middlecore&rsquo; players.&quot;<br/><br/>Basement Crawl supports both 4 player hot-seat and 8 player online play, as well as combinations of both. At the beginning, players start with a selection of 4 available characters, all with their own unique skills balanced carefully against each other. The first three characters are a midget clown, a crash-test dummy, and a girl with a bear.<br/><br/>Basement Crawl was originally rated by the ESRB as &quot;mature&quot;, but was then changed to a &quot;Teen&quot; rating upon release.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Basement Crawl&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"

He would be a danger to any survivor if he hadn't decided to focus his murderous instinct on zombies. He finds being surrounded by potential victims that are actively hunting him terribly exciting. The human mind has nothing left to teach him. The zombie mind, however, even though it seems simpler, has an interesting potential. Well, you have been warned.<br/><br/>- Against all odds, Chuck has managed to survive the rise of the zombies. Living in his parent's basement, this 30 something man child's lack of real world experience hasn't been that much of a disadvantage, since there isn't much of a world anymore. Armed with a deep knowledge of zombie survival lore gleaned off videogames and the internet, Chuck is an unlikely, chubby ally - and possible food source if things get desperate.<br/><br/>- &quot;Gary, master of none&quot;, so people used to say. Gary didn't have a solid education and his demeanor seemed too &quot;cool&quot; to find reliable work and live in the mold of everyday people. He was almost a pariah when the apocalypse struck and shattered the &quot;everyday&quot;. Don't be fooled by his outfit: for his casual unconsern, Gary has done well on its own so far. Gary has always been a survivor, and the zombies didn't really change his habbits. If you're open-minded enough to see through Gary's disguise, he could trust you and share his precious tools of the trade.<br/><br/>- Mack's story is like most - an ordinary, happy man untill the zombies rose, forced to dig deep or die. His peacefull previous life hid his true potential - unfortunatly it took burying his wife and two daughters to bring it out. Taking a car from his lot, he began a cross country zombicide, eventually joining the motley crew of survivors. Mack's fighting spirit has made him a precious resource for any team, and his manic grin gets even wider the worse the odds are!<br/><br/>- Working with putty and tiny tools, Mike has been cooped up for years in his home studio sculpting miniatures for boardgames and the like. Obsessed with his craft, he didn't notice when his wife left and took his daughter with her, and he didn't notice the zombie apocalypse either! Well, that is, until he had to stab the mailman in the eye with a sculpting pick, and the wandered outside out of curiousity to find out what was going on. Mike now works with the other survivors, although they're a little disturbed by how much joy he seems to take in the fact that actual real zombies are &quot;finally&quot; running around.<br/><br/>- Smith mustered out of the special forces straight into private &quot;security&quot;, working all over the world for the highest bidder. Specializing in wetwork and asking no questions, Smith was in town for a contract when all hell broke loose. Fortunatly for him, and unfortunatly for the zombies, he had his arsenal stashed nearby. Though used to working alone, even Smith knows he doesn't have enough bullets to take on the zombie hordes by himself. Forced to cooperate with the other survivors, he's finding it hard on his limited social skills.<br/><br/>Each character has a unique set of gameplay attributes to give you a unique gaming experience.<br/><br/>",

This is the &quot;ocean&quot; where the manatees are swimming. The 4 corners is where the &quot;home&quot; cards go and the very center is a stack of shuffled boat cards that should be face up. All other spaces should each have stacks of two manatee cards on them face down. &quot;<br/>&quot;On your turn, you...<br/><br/>----1. Flip over two manatee cards. If they match, leave them face up. If they do not match, turn them face down again. (OR: if there is a stack of two face-down manatee cards adjacent to an empty space with no manatee cards, you may move the top card from the stack of two into the empty space instead of flipping any cards over.)<br/><br/>----2. If any of YOUR manatees are face up, you may move one of them toward their home location. If you have face up manatee cards that are adjacent to each other, any adjacent manatee can follow the card that moved by moving into the space it just left, and an adjacent manatee can follow that card, and so on. Manatees move up/down and left/right but not diagonal. If a manatee makes it home, that manatee is safe and counts as a point toward winning.<br/><br/>----3. If you moved a manatee you have to move a boat one space too (unless there are no boats left). The boat has to go toward the location matching the manatee on the card, moving up/down and left/right but not diagonal. If the boat lands on the same space as any face-up manatee, the manatee is removed from the game. The boat only moves one space per turn, even if several manatees moved by following the manatee you initially moved. When the boat makes it to the home location, the boat is out of the game.<br/><br/>(Note: You can play competitively or cooperatively. You can move the boats to take your opponents manatees out of the game on purpose or you can work together to have none of the manatees get hit by boats.<br/> Players keep taking turns until one of the players has all of their manatees out of the game, either from getting hit by a boat or making it safely home. At this point, players should count up all the manatees they got home. Each manatee counts as one point. Whoever has the most points wins.&quot;<br/><br/>",

It is part of a sub-series of prequels in the Metal Gear series, taking place after Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker.<br/><br/>The game follows Big Boss' infiltration in American black site on Cuban soil called Camp Omega for the extraction of both Cipher agent Pacifica Ocean and Sandinista child soldier Ricardo &quot;Chico&quot; Valenciano Libre.<br/><br/>The game offers new methods of sneaking and traversal methods as well as choose in what order the story events take place by selecting missions in any order they like. The game was originally set to be released alongside The Phantom Pain but long development time resulted in director Hideo Kojima splitting the project in two parts so that players will get an early access to Metal Gear Solid V. Critical reception to the game has been generally positive with praise aimed towards its mechanics, voice-acting, story, and graphics, with criticism aimed towards its short length.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "Mix! is a game of secret goals and tactical color theory, in which players compete to influence which of six paint colors will be applied to canvases in order to meet their own goals. This requires thoughtful play, as the control each player has over which colors are painted is indirect.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is assigned a goal with two colors -- one color that will grant them points, and another that will cause them to lose points. A player's positive goal is public, while their negative goal is private. Players must work to influence the painting process so as to maximize their positive goal color, and minimize their negative goal color.<br/><br/>Of course, this is easier said than done. Players can only affect the colors that are painted by controlling the location of a shared set of tokens on a color palette. These tokens are moved between sections of the palette by mixing together color cards from a communal pile that all players must play cards into. Players can also play action cards to affect the location of tokens, and the availability of color cards to mix.<br/><br/>Timing is a critical aspect of Mix!, as players can only take one of three possible actions each turn -- either combining color cards to influence the palette, taking on new bonus objectives, or painting. Painting results in all players gaining and losing points based on the state of the palette, and also allows players to complete their bonus objectives. As a result, players must choose carefully when to work to influence the palette versus when to paint, in order to maximize their own gains while minimizing those of their opponents.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, private goals are revealed, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>"

Each Trait is ranked on a scale from one to ten, with four being average. Special abilities, such as magic, super- powers, and other privileges are handled in the same way. The player defines what they can do, and how they work, along with any limitations on their power.<br/><br/>When a Trait is tested, the player rolls two six-sided dice and adds their Rank in the Trait. The margin of success or failure determines the quality of the attempt. When two characters are in direct competition with one another, one side rolls the dice, and the other adds 7 to their Rank. Supporting Traits can give modifiers to a roll by making a linked roll to try and gain an advantage.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "from the Preface:<br/>This dungeon was created as an example to appear in a commercially available set of rules. As if often the case in the development cycle, needs changed and the project was orphaned (so to speak). The actual map was produced by Paratime Design specifically for the project and is reminiscent of several sample dungeons from the halcyon days of our hobby.<br/><br/>This is our first product, intended to fit into a larger scale setting to be released by the Wobbly Goblin as it is developed. The so-called Old School gaming community has produced a lot of good work but has come under some (not completely undeserved) criticism for trying to make a buck off the hobby. Thus, Wobbly Goblin Press was born, a creative outlet for getting some fun, cheap material out to gamers everywhere. We are striving to create both free PDFs and at cost print-on-demand works that are cleanly formatted, well-organized, and fun to play.<br/><br/>We hope we have succeeded. Let us know!<br/><br/>note from the cover:<br/>With minor alterations this adventure may be used with any rules based upon or compatible with 1974 Edition D&amp;D FRPG.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "In Saint Petersburg, you'll be buying different types of cards: workers, buildings, aristocrats, trading cards, and the new market cards. In every phase, a new type of card will be available for purchase. You'll start with workers, who are good at bringing in rubles. The new market (yellow) cards bring in new resources. Having the majorities in these resources from round to round will earn you additional victory points. This battle for the lead enhances the game experience and expands the tactical and strategic possibilities of the players. In the next phase, buildings can be acquired, mostly granting victory points. Aristocrats provide a mix of victory points and rubles, and also lead to a large end-game point bonus that can't be ignored.<br/><br/>Trading cards allow already purchased cards to be improved. These phases will repeat until one of the card decks runs out. At this point, the final victory points are counted, and the winner is declared.<br/><br/>For this new edition of Saint Petersburg, we've kept the well-known and loved basic game, but also added an additional game phase. This will allow us to fully integrate the fifth player into the game. The new market phase will introduce a new mechanic providing additional victory points and rubles. The purple action cards from the banquet expansion will also have matching cards for the market phase. And, of course, for lovers of the old version, it will still be possible to play the game by the original rules.<br/><br/>",

Will you finish all nine holes before the judges carry out their inspection?  If not will stunning scenery and design excellence be enough to beat off the opposition?<br/><br/>The Front Nine is a card game where players compete to build the best nine hole golf course with a balance of challenging par, scenery and facilities. The course cards depict each hole (pars 3, 4 and 5)and after paying the land and resource cost for trees, water and sand, they are laid on the table to depict the actual layout of the course. Each player develops a course from club house to 1st tee and from green to following tee etc. Each hole has a differing topography which constrains tee access and green exits which results in each player's course snaking across the table. Players must manage their finances carefully to enable their course to generate an income to ensure they can afford the ever increasing land costs and resources required to design and build each hole. The winner is the player whose course design best links back to the club house, has the best design, bunkers, woodland and water hazards and optimizes the use of the natural environment.<br/><br/>The Front Nine has direct player interaction and competition and an economic engine with an interesting spatial aspect where careful thought is needed for card purchase and placement.<br/><br/>",

These curses are mysterious and terrifying, punishing transgressors for their misdeeds and reacting to the events that happen to their victims, sometimes even becoming adversaries in and of themselves. In Pathfinder and the 3.5 OGL however, curses are just a minor nuisance that is quickly resolved with remove curse or break enchantment.<br/><br/>This book presents a new type of curse, the mythic curse, which uses the mythic rules presented in Mythic Adventures as a starting point to create dynamic curses, which respond (positively or negatively) to the actions of their victims, and which generally require a whole lot more than a simple spell to get rid of. In addition to rules and guidelines for creating and using your own mythic curses, the book includes 5 sample mythic curses, such as the curse of aging, the curse of babble, and much more, all of which are sure to have a memorable impact on your game.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>There is an island marked on ancient treasure maps simply as &ldquo;Crucible of the Dragons&rdquo;. Old sailors tell tales of blasted ruins, lost cities made of gold, the clockwork secrets of sorcerers, dragons beyond magnificence and demons beyond vile damnation.Sometimes in hushed tones the name &lsquo;Khata&rsquo; is even spoken in connection with this place.<br/><br/>On the Island of Pharae, as it is known to its natives, the remains of human civilisation sit uneasily in the north of the island beside a monster infested interior. It is said that a Dragon-Queen rules the main city, Draxa, while Knights of a lost order fight an ancient demonic enemy and ancient dragons stir only to be devoured by the larvae of an evil reptilian race.<br/><br/>It is a place of marvels beyond comprehension, riches beyond belief and terrors from beyond time.<br/><br/>So come journey with us to a land of dangerous adventure and opportunity. Be ready to make your fortune or meet your doom!<br/><br/>What is this book about?<br/><br/>Crucible of the Dragons  is a classic Old School D100 Sandbox setting which gives you all the pieces you need to play Bronze Age Fantasy adventures inspired by the works of Clark Ashton Smith and Ray Harryhausen. It can be played Sandbox style, with the Games Master using the book&rsquo;s formidable array of gaming material to create adventures in response to the player&rsquo;s characters wanderings on the island, or in a more guided fashion using the prewritten adventures in the Scenarios chapter.<br/><br/>It is a self-contained setting with its own history, cultures and religion. It can be played in isolation or as part of your existing campaign, by placing it in some unexplored sea or ocean.<br/><br/>Overall the emphasis of the setting is providing a place where memorable and fun Swords and Sorcery tales can be played out.<br/><br/>What this book contains<br/><br/>     Gaming in Pherae: This chapter gives players an outline of the setting, and character generation rules for characters from the island. If the player characters are from the island the &ldquo;What the Trader told me&rdquo; section is what they know about the setting at start of play.<br/>     The Land of Pherae: This chapter details the island, giving an overview of its history and inhabitants. A full gazetteer is included.<br/>     The City of the Dragon: The city of Draxa, its inhabitants, a selection of very important people, districts and notable buildings are detailed in this chapter.<br/>     Of Gods and Magic: The religions and magic systems used on the island are covered in this chapter, which also includes sixteen new cults and fifteen new magic spells.<br/>     Heroes and Factions: Ten new organisations, which provide access to magic and skills, are detailed with their history and aims alongside a selection of eleven important heroes and villains who can be encountered as the player characters explore the island.<br/>     Men and Monsters: A &ldquo;stats digest&rdquo; of the common inhabitants of the island, both monstrous and human. Which the Games Master can create encounters at the drop of a hat during play or use them as the basis to create fuller non-player characters for their own scenarios. Also includes rules for creating unique and individual demons and full encounter tables for the island by region.<br/>     Scenarios: For those who prefer more guided play this chapter provides a selection of pre-written adventures, dangerous adventure locales and an epic campaign outline.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

        "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This is a short supplement for the Covert Ops role-playing game. It can be used with the setting provided in brief within the core rulebook (SECTOR) or can be used in any setting you desire. Since this supplement is settingless, it uses the generic term &ldquo;Command&rdquo; to refer to the player operatives&rsquo; organization.<br/><br/>In this supplement, add a little bit of sci to your fi and embrace a shadow world where cybernetic implants are possible. These pages add cybernetics to your espionage and paramilitary fun. Turn your spy into a super spy, or your soldier into a super soldier, with abilities that make him more than human.<br/><br/>This book takes a categorical approach to defining implants. It breaks them down into prosthetics (fully functional replacements for normal body parts), bionics (the lite stuff powered off your body's own bioelectric field), and cybernetics (the heavy stuff, requiring a power supply to function). Beyond this, it breaks them down into three categories of minor, moderate, and major. In addition to defining a cost breakdown, this categorization makes it easy for GMs who want to limit the amount and type of implants available in his setting. One GM might permit only light and moderate prosthetics and bionics in his game, while another might allow full cybernetic conversions if the operative can afford it and wants to pay the price.<br/><br/>Implants do mess with your body's harmony and bioelectric field, and some would say your soul.  Be careful with how much of your humanity you trade in for machine; cybersickness can debilitate you, and if your heavier implants lose power you&rsquo;ll be needing extraction in a hurry!<br/><br/>"

        "description": "from how it came to pass:<br/>This is a hack of a hack of a hack.  What's a hack you say? Well, &quot;hacking&quot; and game in RPG terms means taking the ideas or framework from one game, reskinning it and retooling it to make something new, exciting, and customized.  At least that's how I'm defining it in this case.  My goal is to reinvigorate my love for a beautiful thing.  I love Shadowrun, but sometimes what I really want is Shadowrun's younger, skinnier, sexier cousin.  They're both awesomely amazing and should be checked out as soon as possible.  This game takes the simple elegance of its forebearers and pairs it with the Shadowrun setting and themes we have all grown to cherish.  I hope you enjoy shadow-hack.<br/><br/>",

Conversion tools are provided for adapting outside content, such as characters, monsters, adventures and abilities from d20 open gaming system, so that with a few tweaks, players and storytellers alike can tap into the wealth of content that has been created for these other games, while still keeping the rules and concepts that make the Mayhem game shine.<br/><br/>This book, Volume I, Core Content, is designed to walk a player through the Mayhem game, explain all of the core rules needed to run a game, and enough character content to keep players busy for some time. Further books will add to this content, giving players and storytellers more tools to use in writing their own stories, but this manual is where the game starts.<br/><br/>We hope you enjoy playing the game as much as we have enjoyed building it.<br/><br/>user note:<br/>The black and white demo contains the same rules as the color version of the game.<br/><br/>"

        "description": "from What Is This:<br/>This is a game designed to let you explore perilous fantasy worlds of sword and sorcery, where adventurers embark on dangerous quests and do battle with formidable foes. The theme and core of this game is quite obviously based off of Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson's classic role-playing game and the various iterations of it that followed. Mechanically, the game takes many influences from the works of Vincent Baker, John Harper, Eric Provost, Kirin Robinson, Adam Koebel, Sage LaTorra, Jason Morningstar, Clinton R. Nixon, and Michael Wight.<br/><br/>At its core, the game's adventuring system is largely inspired by World of Dungeons and its predecessors. For combat, Old School Hack served as the primary model for phased rounds and combat zones. Experience is driven by a system derived from The Shadow of Yesterday. The relationships between the adventurers are culled from various Fiasco playsets. The style is of classic dungeon-delving, dragon-fighting, old-school adventure. I'll admit it is mostly constructed with borrowed materials, tweaked and slapped together into a fantasy frankenstein of sorts, but I thought there was enough here to warrant a name and layout.<br/><br/>"
