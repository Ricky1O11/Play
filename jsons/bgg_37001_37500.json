When he discovered that many of his junior high math students shared his enthusiasm for outdoor activities, he came up with a way to make statistics and probability more interesting to them.  Drawing on his own experiences afield and information from fish and game departments, he developed a game that would involve fishing and hunting while teaching certain mathematical concepts.  When people kept insisting that the game  was too much fun to confine to the classroom, the idea was born of developing an activity that would challenge and entertain sportsmen when time, weather, or resources prohibited an excursion afield.  The OUTDOORSMAN GAME is the result of those efforts.  In the game, the species of fish, fowl, and big game, and the seasons and areas in which they are pursued, closely follow the actual events as they occur in Eastern Oregon.

Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.<br/><br/>The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own &ndash; some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.<br/><br/>To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts.

In addition to these cards, there are also God Cards that provide special powers. Because players use up their cards (&quot;resources&quot;) to race, in each cycle there is an opportunity to acquire more resources by making sacrifices to the gods. The more you sacrifice, the better resources you receive. However, your sacrifice power is limited, so you must be careful to use it wisely.  Each cycle sets specific &quot;Racing Conditions&quot; that change from cycle to cycle, allowing for different strategies as the game progresses.

If so he can start the preparations for his procession immediately by laying this card on the table in front of him, face upwards. Each player makes his own procession. There are eight cards in a complete procession. If he has no police-card he passes one card, face downwards, to the next player.<br/>If he has been able to play a police-card he takes another card from the centre pack and, if able, plays a FORCES card on to his procession and so on. When unable to add to his procession he passes any one card, face downwards, to the next player, leaving himself with three cards as at first.<br/>Cards must be placed in a line in the following order: policeman, soldier, sailor, royal coach, page, archbishop, and queen. Each processional card placed in front of a player scores 10 points and the queen-card scores 30 points, giving a maximum of 100 points per game.<br/><br/>A game is completed when one player has presented the Queen for crowning or the last card of the centre pack has been taken.<br/><br/>There are 54 cards in the deck.<br/><br/>"}, "37090": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "average": "5.33333", "poll": [], "name": "Family Favourites", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pattern Building", "Pattern Recognition"], "yearpublished": "1955", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2441068_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Racey Helps"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Pepys (Castell Brothers)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2441068.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Pepys First Edition", "Pepys Second Edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Card Game", "Number"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "This 1960's card game comes with 44 cards depicting family pets.

Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.<br/><br/>After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival&hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?<br/><br/>Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.<br/><br/>Official Site, Rules &amp; FAQ: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&amp' rel='nofollow'>http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm...</a>;esem=4<br/>Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: <a target='_blank' href='http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ' rel='nofollow'>http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ</a><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Chinese Edition", "English first edition", "English preorder edition", "English second edition", "French Edition", "German first edition", "German second edition", "Italian first edition", "Italian Second Edition", "Polish edition", "Spanish edition"], "average": "7.77629", "name": "Battlestar Galactica", "playingtime": "300", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Partnerships", "Role Playing", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["Battlestar Galactica: Daybreak Expansion", "Battlestar Galactica: Exodus Expansion", "Battlestar Galactica: Official Variant Rules", "Battlestar Galactica: Pegasus Expansion"], "usersrated": "25199", "boardgameaccessory": ["Battlestar Galactica: Civilian Ship Bases"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Battlestar Galactica"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["AP Podcast \u2013 Episodio 5: Battlestar Galactica", "AP Podcast \u2013 Episodio 9: Copycat y Last Will", "Battlestar Galactica The Board Game", "BGTG 133 - 100 Great Games, part 2 (with Stephen Glenn and Mark Jackson)", "BGWS 060 \u2013 Battlestar Galactica: The Reality Show", "Board2Death Podcast Episode 5 - Introductions Round One", "Carnagecast 13: Battlestar Galactica Actual Play, Part 1", "Carnagecast 15: Battlestar Galactica Actual Play, Part 2", "Carnagecast 17: Battlestar Galactica Actual Play, Part 3", "Carnagecast 19: Battlestar Galactica Actual Play, Part 4", "Carnagecast Extrasode 5: A Dark and Stormy Night", "Con, February 2013: Warpcon report", "Cubepushers - Episode 2: Traitors Everywhere!", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 001", "D6G Episode 15: Interview with designer and in depth review of Battlestar Galatica Board game", "DTS010 - Dice Tower Showdown, Episode # 10", "El cyberhipodromo, los cylones con mas de un mill\u00f3n de elefantes", "Ep 028 \u2013 What defines a good Ameritrash?", "Ep 26 MACE With Ron McClung", "Ep 41 Intellectual Properties", "Ep. 18 &ndash; Top 10 Filler Games &amp; Jason Kotarski | Podcast of Nonsensical Gamers", "Ep. 8 Hidden Roles", "Episode 10 - Space: The Final Frontier", "Episode 18", "Episode 22 - Games Rule, Rulebooks Drool", "Episode 58 - The Networks", "Episode 72 March Craziness Dice Game Style Part 1", "Episode 8 - Shadows over Camelot vs Battlestar Galactica", "Episode 99.99\u2013Game Buffet you Traitorous Dog!", "Episodio 11 \u2013 Especial verano 2013: Juegos no jugados", "Gameophiles Podcast Episode 8", "I've Been Diced!

Each is a set of 60 figures, with 8 random figures in each pack, Giants included huge figures. A fourth set, Feywild, was announced but not released. The Starter Set released with Dungeons of Dread, contains a rulebook, five fixed models, their stat cards, counters for tracking damage, a twenty-sided die and two double sided battle maps.<br/><br/>Notable changes in the 2nd Edition:<br/><br/>     Alignment has been simplified. The &quot;Chaotic&quot; and &quot;Lawful&quot; tags have been removed. Only models considered to be absolutely &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Evil&quot; are given an alignment.<br/>     Warband building is no longer based on alignment, but on &quot;Factions&quot;. Each model belongs to one or more of four factions. Every model in a warband must share at least one faction.<br/>     Commanders are gone, replaced by champions. Models no longer make morale checks or rout. Models reduced to half damage are &quot;bloodied.&quot; Certain game effects may trigger from this state.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Wizards of the Coast is revising all the stat cards from 11 sets of the first edition of the game to make them compatable with the new version of the game.

By doing so they made golf portable (think family vacations, road trips and even around the office), accessible and incredibly easy to learn, even for someone who has never stepped foot on a real fairway.<br/><br/>Par Out Golf is challenging, exciting and incredibly unique, playing as inconsistently as the real sport thanks to a twist you'll never &quot;see&quot; coming! It puts you and your family in the middle of the action, competing in stroke play, match play, or one of the many variations that will continue to challenge and entertain round after round.<br/><br/>Best for ages 5 and up and from 1 to 4 players, Par Out Golf is filled with lighthearted competition as players shoot for the lowest score through the 18 stunningly illustrated holes on the course. Game play is easy to learn for the amateur or junior golfer, and still challenging for the pro requiring a strikingly similar level of skill and focus on every shot.<br/><br/>Best of all, this course can be played again and again! A simple wipe with a damp cloth is all it takes to get the greens and fairways ready for another round.<br/><br/>Par Out Golf is played on a set of spiral bound, laminated pages. Special &quot;wet-erase&quot; markers are used so the line is easy to draw, won't smudge, and very easy to erase. The rules are very, very close to the game of golf, complete with sand and water traps, obstacles and slopes. So close is it to &quot;real&quot; golf, you can play each of five classic variations of golf: stroke play, match play, tombstone play, and pro play.<br/><br/>Of the several skills you practice while playing Par Out Golf, a fascinating, and, to any golf player, significant challenge is learning how to visualize your shot. The more observant you are, the more capable you are at remembering the lay of the land, the more effectively you can imagine the exact amount of drive to put on the ball, the better you'll do. This, of course, is the essence of Par Out Golf. Like &quot;real&quot; golf, Par Out Golf challenges both mind and body. If you want to know more about the physical and cognitive aspects of the game, take a look at the thoughtfully written essay: Par Out Science 101 at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.paroutgolf.com' rel='nofollow'>www.paroutgolf.com</a>.<br/><br/>If you want, you can practice on the Driving Range (on another page) or use the 19th hole (on yet another page) to design your own. You can add your own obstacles, changing the difficulty of each hole, essentially making the game something you can play for-just-about-ever.<br/><br/>Par Out Golf is recommended for 1 to 4 players (it comes with four different wet-erase markers). If you must try before you buy, you can download the first three holes online.<br/><br/>"}, "37193": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic347891.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2001", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Dragons Treasure, Inc"], "maxplaytime": "25", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic347891_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Fantasy"], "description": "Imagine a world where the Magic is dying.

The object of the game is to score the most points possible during each turn. Players score points when a die or dice combination matches one or more numbers on the field of play. Players use glass markers to cover those numbers as they compete.<br/><br/>Game in a Nutshell<br/><br/>The first player rolls three dice onto the field of play, called the leather , then uses glass markers ( paddy flats , or flatties ) to cover numbers that match an individual die or dice combination (see Basic Roll). A turn ends when a player is topped &mdash;unable to use all three dice to cover one, two, or three numbers on the leather . On the final roll of a turn, a player is allowed to cover as many numbers as possible, even if all of the dice cannot be played. At the end of each turn, points are added up and recorded by the scorekeeper. The dice are then passed to the next player.<br/><br/>Players must always roll three dice. If a roll results in stacked or cocked dice, including those cocked against a flattie , all three must be rolled again.<br/><br/>The player with the most accumulated points wins the match.<br/><br/>Basic Roll <br/>Dice can be added together or played as naturals.

To do this he must build structures that are the core of the Economic, Military, Cultural and Religious life.<br/>At the same time all the player must be aware of the invasion that can come from outside and if necessary must be able to collaborate to defeat them.<br/><br/>Comuni is a game of strategy. The core of the game is trying to acquire &quot;projects of buildings&quot; (cards) that can be automatically transformed in buildings and protection walls (and subsequent upgrades).<br/>The acquisition of the projects is made through a bidding system.<br/>The buildings can be of four types (Economic, Military Cultural and Religious) that give different resources. The resources give different advantages during the game in the bidding phase, when you transform projects into buildings etc....<br/>The projects cards are divided in four different decks, at the end of each of them, an invasion comes, each time stronger. The invasion hits all players and during the invasion each player must defend his city. The players also can (and have an incentive to) collaborate to fight the aggression together.<br/>At the end of the four invasions the game ends.<br/>The key element of this game is the ability to plan a successful strategy predicting what will be the situation several turns in advance.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["TENKIGAMES English/German/French edition"], "average": "6.72839", "name": "Comuni", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting", "Partnerships", "Set Collection"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "963", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Italy"]}, "37232": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Corner", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Card Drafting", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Point to Point Movement", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Variable Phase Order"], "yearpublished": "2008", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic353195_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Giochi Games"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic353195.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Dice", "Educational", "Mythology"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Corner is a strategic game of wits and luck.<br/><br/>This game basically allows players to engage in a &quot;battle&quot; to eliminate the other player's pieces.

They draw assignment cards from a deck, take money (the amount depends on which city zone they are in and where they are going) and drive to the address on the card using movement points rolled with a six-sided die. Players decide beforehand whether the game ends for example when someone has completed five assignments or when the last card in the deck has been drawn and the action completed.<br/><br/>During the game, the players are free to choose their routes in the streets, but movement has some restrictions: right-hand side traffic, stop signs, one-way streets etc. Violating the no-stopping sign or speed limits results in a ticket and the player loses money (for example rolling a 5 on a street with a speed limit of 3 means that the player pays 2). There are also tunnels and a ferry which give additional choices. If cars of two players collide, both go to the repair shop and the player who was moving at the time must pay a sum equivalent to the remainder of movement points on the die. Among the assignment cards there are a few cards on car maintenance, vehicle inspection and insurance which require payments and movements to appropriate locations. When the end conditions agreed upon are met, the player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>The rules were written in May 1968. The original game board is a paper sheet glued on a thick two-fold cardboard. The city zone payment chart is thin cardboard as are the 70 cards and the small square ferry.

On each of the pick-up stations (green), two passenger/freight tiles are placed randomly, face down.  Players roll a die to move (and sometimes advance the sun along its path in the sky).  As trains arrive at a pick-up station, players reveal the goods/passengers.  Sometimes, the player will load them onto their cars (limited number of cars on each train).  Sometimes, they will leave them for other players to pick up.  A player can even take a passenger part-way and leave them for another train to complete the job later.<br/><br/>The idea is to work together to see how many jobs will be completed before the game ends.<br/><br/>"}, "37496": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Flinke B\u00fcrste", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic357534_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Erzi"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic357534.jpg", "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game", "Educational"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "The title translates to Quick (tooth) Brush.<br/><br/>Two horseshoe shaped wood pieces carry 20 wooden teeth pieces, zero to three wood rings are laid over the teeth, the players walk around this &quot;mouth&quot; with their pieces, wooden tooth brushes.
