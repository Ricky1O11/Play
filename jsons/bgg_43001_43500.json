It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next. Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda. There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style. Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations).<br/><br/>Yomi is the Japanese word for &ldquo;reading&rdquo;, in this case as in reading the mind of your opponent. Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a fight between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character, with 10 decks in the first release.<br/><br/>Champion fighting game tournament player and tournament organizer David Sirlin designed the game to test the skills of Valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to guess which moves your opponent will make. There is more to it than guessing, though: some players have the uncanny ability to &ldquo;guess&rdquo; right almost every time, no matter the game.<br/><br/>The core mechanic is a paper-rock-scissors guessing game between attack, throw, and block/dodge (sometimes modified by special ability cards). Attacks and throws usually let you follow up with combo cards from your hand, while blocks let you draw a card. While it first seems &quot;just random,&quot; you soon discover that the unequal and uncertain payoffs in this guessing game allow you really read what the opponent will do.

The game is a light-weight eurogame, built around the short-term rapid point gains vs long-term investments dilemma. General flow of play is as follows:<br/><br/>Phase 1: Players get resources for expansion and decide on play order<br/><br/>In this phase, players pick cards with resources that enable expansion on the board. In general he/she who gets most food, plays last. First player expands with least food.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Players expand on the board to earn points or money.<br/><br/>Players begin to form strings and/or clusters of huts and pay for placing them with their food cards. Depending on where huts are placed, they either score points or earn camels (money).<br/><br/>Phase 3: Players spend money/camels on various investments.<br/><br/>A player either goes for one-time bonuses from the nobles of Assur, or makes long-term investments by offerings to gods and building Ziggurats.<br/><br/>The game lasts for three eras, made up of 2-3 of such cycles. After each era comes the flood: the board is partially cleaned up, but players also capitalize on their investments from phase 3.

Game is available in print and play version and also via e-book.<br/><br/>From the Downey Games website:<br/><br/>&quot;Fast Lane Racing is the culmination of two years worth of design and testing.<br/><br/>With Fast Lane Racing, we&rsquo;ve covered all of the bases.  Every element of open wheel racing is covered from qualifying right down to the checkered flag.<br/><br/>In Fast Lane racing, drivers are rated separately for qualifying and racing, giving you an extremely accurate picture of each and every driver to get behind the wheel in the 2008 season.  To further enhance the realism, each driver is rated for the various track types run in the open wheel series.  Drivers are also rated for their ability to lead laps, how they perform during pit stops, and tendency to avoid mechanical failures.  You truly get an accurate representation of each driver.<br/><br/>All tracks are individually rated as well.  Each track is rated for Pole Position Speed, number of caution flags, Racing Speed, and weather.<br/><br/>Speaking of weather; how many times have you watched a race and heard the drivers and commentators talk about how the track has changed due to weather?  In Fast Lane Racing, we&rsquo;ve replicated this most important facet of racing.  You&rsquo;ll see the effects of a green track following heavy rains.  You&rsquo;ll see drivers run faster laps at Indianapolis as the track closes and the track cools.<br/><br/>And speaking of Indianapolis, we have replicated EVERY facet of the unique qualifying format of the world&rsquo;s most famous race, right down to the bumping into the field!<br/><br/>Fast Lane Racing is not a quick play game.  However, we&rsquo;ve compressed the racing into the most exciting elements, giving you a game that plays quickly.  With Fast Lane Racing, you&rsquo;ll be able to realistically complete an entire season.  A typical race and qualifying session takes approximately 40 to 60 minutes total.  If you use actual qualifiers and only run the races, you&rsquo;ll consistently finish within 20 minutes.  And while we have compressed the racing, we have not cut corners.  You&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see&rdquo; every detail of the race unfold right on your tabletop!<br/><br/>Each Fast Lane Racing Year Book contains everything you need to play.  There are no external &ldquo;game parts&rdquo; to buy.<br/><br/>The printed games feature individual, die-cut driver and track cards, with everything packed in a sturdy game box.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "43191": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491435.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1967", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491435_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "description": "2 game combo with one side of the board with Superman and the other side with Superboy.

It consistently ranks among the greatest films of all time; in 2007 it ranked at #34 in a list of 100 and was the only animated film in the list. In 1989 the film was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; Like other Disney projects, spin-off marketing soon created related merchandise.

Thus, the UN forces were badly overextended when the bluff materialized as a force of thirty divisions, having infiltrated into the Korean mountains.<br/><br/>UN forces were sent reeling back to the 38th Parallel in confusion, attempting to reestablish a front line.

Poke was published in Esquire Magazine in 1946, and he published Slam himself in 1951. Slam, since it has more rules, came in an approximately 4&quot;x2&quot; white paper booklet. Both of these games would be reprinted in Sackson's book A Gamut of Games in 1969, while Triad would appear (slightly modified) as Pe-Ling in 1970. Triad was then published in GAMES magazine in 1986, while Pe-Ling was presented at Spiel in 1989 and in included in an issue #5 of Spielbox in 1990.<br/><br/>Triad is similar to Mah Jongg, but uses a special deck made from two decks of cards using only the ace through 8 of each suit. For four players, a third set of cards is added. The rules mostly detail scoring for the various hands that can be formed.<br/><br/>In this game, players try to combine twelve cards in three sets of four cards, each set belonging to one of the three classes allowed. To do this, players can choose to take a face-up card from the draw pile or a face-down card from the discard pile. A set of the Class 1 type consists of four cards of the same suit. For Class 2 sets, each four cards should be arranged as two pairs, with the sum of the values being 9 (e.g., 2, 2 and 7, 7). Class 3 is about making groups of four cards of the same number (e.g., 2, 2, 2, 2). In each Class, some cards combinations are considered weak, easy or strong, giving 2, 4 or 8 points, respectively. Moreover, there are several conditions and card combinations that add doubling factors progressively to the total sum. In this way, one doubling multiplies the points by a factor of 2, two by 4, three by 8, etc. The game lasts several rounds until a player reaches a predetermined amount of points.<br/><br/>"}, "43221": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Sahara Patrol", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1959", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": {"11006": "Country: France"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491627_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"507": {"name": "Chad Valley Co Ltd."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic491627.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"107831": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "French Foreign Legion racing against Arab tribesmen for control of the desert forts.

The game is far too luck driven for repeated plays - but it has superb production values, including 3d features (the Target, Deer and Treasury) and a wonderfully illustrated board.<br/><br/>The game is for 2-4 players. Each player chooses a corner of the board, which is used to hold the players pegs (&quot;arrows&quot;) and any money that the player wins.<br/><br/>Each player takes a member of Robin Hood's band (Will Scarlet, Friar Tuck, Little John or Maid Marian) and places them at the &quot;Start&quot; square. Each player then uses the spinner in centre of the board; instead of numbers, the spinner points to different coloured squares, Each players playing piece is then moved around the board to the next relevant coloured square,<br/><br/>When a player lands on a square with instructions on, they must be obeyed.

The system is based on the universal (or &quot;Megaversal&quot;) system used by Rifts, Heroes Unlimited, Palladium Fantasy, and other games published by Palladium Books (i.e. Kevin Siembieda).<br/><br/>The core rulebook was first published in 1985, written by the late Erick Wujcik.  Purportedly written in just five and a half weeks, the game sold 10,000 copies very quickly and was Palladium's first big hit.  One notorious aspect of the first edition was a detailed list of sexual deviations available to characters.  The core book was revised and published again in 1990, with the sexual deviations removed.<br/><br/>In the time between the first printing of the core book and the second printing, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had exploded in popularity and become the subject of children's entertainment, to the detriment of TMNT &amp; Other Strangeness's popularity.  In 2000, Palladium chose not to renew the licensing to publish TMNT material.<br/><br/>One of the most (if not THE most) interesting aspects of the rules involves the use solely of animal species and their mutation in character creation.  There are no rules for creating a human character in the core book.  Wujcik's effort in writing the animal mutation rules proved to be a major feature of the game.<br/><br/>One supplement for the game, titled &quot;After The Bomb&quot;, involves life for mutants in a post-apocalyptic world where they are much more ubiquitous than in TMNT &amp; Other Strangeness where mutants exist on the fringe of modern [1984-1990] human society.  Later, After The Bomb emerged as &quot;After The Bomb RPG&quot;, a full-fledged game of its own, though obviously grown from the animal mutation concepts originally born in TMNT &amp; Other Strangeness and the post-apocalyptic setting introduced in the After The Bomb supplement.<br/><br/>TMNT &amp; Other Strangeness was conceived shortly after the first few comic books had been published.  The original TMNT comics contained more violence and gritty material than the incarnations of the TMNT after their rise in popularity and acclimation to younger demographics.  This is why TMNT &amp; Other Strangeness is actually an adolescent- to adult-oriented RPG, not one for children, although the level of violence obviously depends on the context of the adventures being run and the people involved.  Comic book portions of the rulebook show violence in various forms, from guns to martial arts, but never very graphically.  One example of play describes a scene where a player character is being shot at close range with a pistol, while an illustration for one of the adventures at the back of the book shows people who are obviously dead; these seem to mark the most violent points in the core book.<br/><br/>"}, "43368": {"rpg": {"728": "After the Bomb"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "After the Bomb", "rpgproducer": {"13722": "Alex Marciniszyn"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic501628.jpg", "usersrated": "44", "rpgitemversion": {"11": "First Printing"}, "average": "6.36364", "rpgissuearticle": {"78228": "Crystal & the Trans-D Tavern"}, "rpggenre": {"1103": "Animal (Anthropomorphic)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic501628_t.jpg", "description": "Palladium's post-apocalyptic setting book for TMNT.
