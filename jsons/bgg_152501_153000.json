I mean, they&rsquo;re demon-worshiping hyena people. What&rsquo;s not to love? In my own Desteon campaign setting I use them the way Native Americans were (inaccurately) portrayed in a lot of Westerns. They&rsquo;re denizens of the New World, wandering the plains, attacking settlers and caravans with reckless abandon and calculated brutality. I picture them as the ultimate chaos warriors, wandering around setters&rsquo; towns and villages for no other reason than they&rsquo;re there, dying their fur wild colors, painting things with strange, otherworldly designs. They&rsquo;re the reavers from Firefly. They&rsquo;re the Batman&rsquo;s Joker at his most psychotic. They commit atrocities because they find them entertaining and while they do, they laugh, and laugh, and laugh. In my world, gnolls are scary and insane.<br/><br/>To make things a little less black-and-white, I also have the gnolls playing an important part in the ecosystem. They&rsquo;re scavengers. They let nothing go to waste. If the find a carcass that another predator has left, they utilize it. Bones and sinew and flesh and hair all get re-purposed and recycled and used for tools and traps. When gnolls do leave a body behind, it&rsquo;s to serve as a message to others. If they wipe a human settlement out of existence, should it really have been there in the first place? Not that conservation is an excuse for mindless brutality, but wiping out a tribe of gnolls usually results in unintended consequences.<br/><br/>Gnoll Hide tries to add a little depth and variety to a race that&rsquo;s been second-tier at best since the 1st edition. I try to present not just alternate block stats, but some possibilities on how they might be more effectively utilized in your own campaign world.<br/><br/>"}, "152507": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Troll Hide: Classic Monsters Reskinned", "rpgproducer": {"32066": "Berin Kinsman"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1874911.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"228361": "PDF version"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"24150": "Hide: Classic Monsters Reskinned"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1874911_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Trolls in fantasy games are the equivalent of birthday candles that won&rsquo;t blow out. I remember my first, frustrating encounter with them back in 1st edition. We kept hacking away at them, and they kept healing the damage we&rsquo;d done. I think the first time I lost a player character was to a troll that regenerated faster than we could hurt it. My hatred of these things was palpable.<br/><br/>As a gamemaster I&rsquo;ve very rarely used trolls in my game, especially against lower-level characters, because I&rsquo;m not a &ldquo;killer GM&rdquo;. Bumping off characters for sport isn&rsquo;t my idea of fun. In published adventures, I tended to swap out other creatures, usually ogres or hill giants, the types of creatures that equated to the trolls of myth and legend. I don&rsquo;t recall the things that lived under bridges and harassed billy goats having a healing factor like Wolverine.<br/><br/>Yet they are an iconic monster, and people expect them. There are players that actually like to fight them. So I needed to find ways to make them interesting, palatable to my tastes, and to give them some logical and rational reason for existence in my own campaign world of Desteon. That meant that I either had to make them into sympathetic characters, or weave them into the overall ecology in my world building. In Troll Hide, I&rsquo;ve done a little of both. Hopefully, you can use this information to make the trolls in your game more than just a go-to hack-and-slash encounter.<br/><br/>"}, "152508": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Escaletto: Das neue Rechenspiel", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1883591_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"127": {"name": "Klee"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1883591.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"228364": "CH edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1094": {"name": "Educational"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Each player has 5 meeples.

Up to five players work together as heroes on missions against the enemies of the Imperium (Solo play is also supported).<br/><br/>Each new game begins with players choosing from one of six hero archetypes: Assassin, Duelist, Grunt, Medic, Officer, and Psi Mage. Each hero is represented by a Stat card listing his attributes and default abilities/attacks. Each hero also has a deck of Ability cards from which the player can choose up to five. Some Ability cards are marked as &quot;Advanced&quot; and count as two cards. This allows players to choose fewer, but more powerful cards if they wish.<br/><br/>Once player have chosen their heroes and Ability cards, they select a mission to be played. Each mission description includes which enemies will be encountered and what goals the player must meet to win. An Encounter deck can also be used (especially for solo players) to randomize which enemies will be fought during the mission.<br/><br/>Each mission also includes a map of the game board. The board consists of several tiles that players assemble prior to the beginning of play. Paper miniatures, representing both heroes and enemies, are placed on the board and moved on a turn-by-turn basis. Each turn allows players to carry out several actions including attacking, movement, and using items. Control of the enemy side is either done by a single player who chose not to have a hero, or by hero players on a rotating basis.<br/><br/>Enemies in the game are grouped into three main factions: the primitive Ferans, slave-trading Ougluks, and the technologically advanced Warlock Industries.

Each card contains one questions with four alternative<br/>answers marked A,B,C or D.<br/><br/>Choosing the right answer:<br/>If the couple lands on a blue square, one of the other players picks up a 'Guys' card and directs one question on it to the male partner. He must choose the alternative which he feels is most appropriate to him. His partner must try to anticipate his feelings or attitudes on that question and choose the same alternative. Couples should be open and honest in their choice of answer. Similarly, if the couple lands on a pink square, a 'Girls' card would be taken and its question directed towards the female partner. She will choose and answer and her partner should try to anticipate this response.<br/><br/>Questions marked 'BOTH' are  designed to test compatibility, with each partner choosing their own favourite answer in response to the question asked.<br/><br/>Using the Electronic Perfect Match device:<br/>These devices are in the shape of four hearts joined together. Each heart is labeled A,B,C or D, representing the four alternatives on the Perfect Match question cards. When a question is asked and each partner has silently decided on which alternative to choose, they each hold up their device with the chosen representative letter uppermost. They must not allow each other to see their choices. The two devices are then pressed together. If the electronic tone sounds, a perfect match has been achieved for that question.<br/><br/>Dare Cards:<br/>Scattered throughout both packs of cards are Dare Cards. If one these cards appears, the couple must perform whatever is required of them according to the instructions on the card. Their performance is adequate (as indicated by a show of hands) then the couple may roll the die again and continue their turn. Be warned - if you are too easy on others then there is no challenge to perform well. If you are too tough, then your opponent will be equally tough on you. So be fair!<br/><br/>Playing the game: Each couple rolls the die once and those with the highest score start, moving their marker the corresponding number of squares. One of the other players then reads the first question to the starting couple. If the couple achieves a Perfect Match, they roll the die again and advance the corresponding number of squares along the board. Remember, a couple can only roll the die and advance after  they have successfully answered a Perfect Match question or performed a Dare task. The couple continues in this way until they are unsuccessful in either a Perfect Match question or a Dare performance, in which case the control of the game is handed over to the next couple (moving clockwise).<br/><br/>Winning the Game:<br/>The first couple to reach the Perfect Match Heart Light and then successfully achieve a Perfect Match from their Choice of either a Girls or Guys question will be declared the winner.<br/><br/><br/>    Special Note<br/><br/><br/>Should the electronic tone stop working use a nail file or a similar tool to lever apart the two case sections of the blue device. Carefully removed the battery, replacing it with one of identical type. Be sure to position it positive side up. When pressing the case sections back together, locate the letter &quot;A&quot; on the plastic cover over the battery position.<br/><br/>Based on the formerly popular 1980s Network Ten (and much later Seven Network in 2002) Australian TV dating game show of the same name.<br/><br/>"}, "152555": {"statistics": {}, "name": "You Don't Know Jack Question Pack", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"228435": "Windows CD-ROM edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"5747": "You Don't Know Jack"}, "videogametheme": {"2350": "Movie, Book, TV show"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogameexpansion": {"72651": "You Don't Know Jack"}, "videogamegenre": {"2169": "Trivia"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"152556": "You Don't Know Jack Vol. 1 XL"}, "description": "User Summary - Partially borrowed from the original YDKJ entry.<br/><br/>You Don't Know Jack is a trivia game that uses elements of pop culture to ask entertaining trivia questions to the players.

The first player takes a card from the Brainbox and turns the timer over. The player then has ten seconds to study the picture on the card. When the timer runs out the card is passed to player two and player one rolls the die to see which question is to be asked. The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player Two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to Player One to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the Brainbox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully! The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins! If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card. The player who answers the most correctly wins! For 1 player Look at the card as above for ten seconds. Then turn the card over and answer all the questions (use a pen and paper to record the answers). If all questions are answered correctly the card is kept. If any answers are incorrect, the card has to be put back in the Brainbox.

It presented alternative critical hit tables that were meant to balance out the odds of characters achieving a critical, but really provided colorful alternatives to simply doing more damage. The effects were sometimes devastating, sometimes humorous, and almost always more interesting than just rolling double damage.<br/><br/>Nearly every gaming group I&rsquo;ve played in or gamemastered for has used some variation of these tables. In Second Edition, I had a ranger that has just achieved 2nd level put an arrow through a dragon&rsquo;s eye, killing it instantly. Was it ridiculous? Sure. Was it awesome? Absolutely! Did that character ever do anything that cool, ever again? Not really, but it did change the tone of the entire campaign as the player characters had to live up to their own legend.<br/><br/>First Edition rules were very different from the current Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules. There was a lot more left up to gamemaster caveat, and many things were left open to interpretation. In using those old tables in our current campaign, we kept having to make mental adjustments. Pathfinder has specific combat conditions meant to simulate some of the effects described in those table, that work in specific ways. Pathfinder also has its own critical hit system, which adjusts the threat range for specific weapons, as well as setting different critical damage multipliers. It became obvious to me that we needed to stop trying to fit square pegs into round holes, and that a new set of critical tables needed to be created.<br/><br/>Greatest Hits and Epic Misses is meant to capture the feel of those original tables, leveraging the Pathfinder rules without losing the intent of its critical hit system or significantly altering the rules. It&rsquo;s not as lethal as the original, by design. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s particularly fair for a 2nd level character to kill a dragon outright without at least a saving throw, even if it did benefit me greatly back in the day. That works both ways; I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s particularly fair for a player character to get decapitated or lose a limb through a random die roll without some sort chance to avoid that fate. The idea is that when a player rolls really well (or really poorly) something unusual should happen. Things that have a mechanical affect, yes, but also add to the story. These aren&rsquo;t more rules simply for the sake of making more rules; these tables exist to add some twists to the story.<br/><br/>"}, "152773": {"rpgitemversion": {"228791": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Prepare for War: Basic Training", "rpgproducer": {"72593": "Greg LaRose"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"24237": "Prepare for War"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Prepare for War: Basic Training simulates boot camp suitable for any war campaign in a fantasy setting.<br/><br/>As newly selected recruits, the PCs go through the rigors of basic training in which they will have to run the obstacle course, train on the use of weapons, learn the use of formations in combat, assemble a catapult, and maybe see a little combat action, all under the guidance of training instructor Sgt Lithgow.<br/><br/>In two weeks of training, they will be cut off from the daily life of a city, and placed into a routine of training that is to be expected of an elite unit.<br/><br/>Prepare for War: Basic Training is a zero level adventure and is intended for 4 &ndash; 6 Player Characters.

Surrounded by greater and potentially unfriendly powers, the players&rsquo; tools for supplantation and overthrow are not in fact battles or force of arms, but instead only the threat of them, used as a tool supporting the diplomatic and economic cores of the game. For by defining and redefining their own political objectives as specifically, as well as ambitiously or conservatively, as they like, players use military struggle over resources to tie the economy to the government.<br/><br/>No fighting ever takes place in a game of Damocles. Rather, players use their abstracted military forces, of several types, in combination to exert verbal control, whether transient or permanent, over the production of resources in various economic regions across the board. Any player may claim the right to produce from a certain production point simply by saying so; any other player may stay that right by doing the same if he or she wishes. Either can choose to fight a &ldquo;war&rdquo; of control by playing out the military maneuvering to its end, but either can also verbally relinquish his or her control to avoid having to do so.<br/><br/>Because all the while the involved players are posturing and maneuvering for control of a resource, every other player is still playing the game: producing resources, positioning threats over control, operating trade routes, running his or her government. Moments spent squabbling over resources are moments not spent on other things. Sometimes demonstrating a competent military position over a region isn&rsquo;t worth the time it takes away for addressing issues of politics and trade. And although a player may opt to step, player by player, through a military sequence, doing so severely degrades relations between the involved parties and temporarily suspends all nonmilitary activity on the player&rsquo;s part.<br/><br/>For most of play in Damocles is not jostling military over resources. In the interest of mutual productivity, quarreling players may often find themselves inclined to settle into regulated borders, freeing themselves to focus on economic struggle rather than military&mdash;reserving military forces for the right time and the right place.<br/><br/>In Damocles, each kingdom&rsquo;s economy supports not only its population, but also its infrastructure, military forces, and ruling class. And because each player&rsquo;s kingdom, built in real time at the beginning of the game from individually and arbitrarily available miniature hexagonal tiles, differs&mdash;often substantially&mdash;from each other player&rsquo;s kingdom, much of what a player&rsquo;s economy requires may be more efficiently available through mutually beneficial trade.<br/><br/>By trading, however, each player relinquishes a sometimes uncomfortable degree of control over his or her own economy. Trading with other players creates increasingly independent transborder ties between transacting kingdoms&rsquo; traders and merchants. Ties of trade, rather than of government, are durable and difficult to break and when solidified cannot be dissolved at a monarch&rsquo;s whim without grave repercussions, and perhaps only by undue effort. Stopping trade degrades relations permanently&mdash;not least because a country&rsquo;s political influence among its neighbors relies partly on its level of trade with them.<br/><br/>However, political influence among one&rsquo;s neighbors arises from more than macroeconomic ties. In Damocles, each player is free to act as he or she wishes, without limitation, subject only to the efficiencies arising from his or her government&rsquo;s structure. But that structure in turn can be abused by the player&rsquo;s opponents as they conspire to subvert members of the player&rsquo;s government for their own ends. The player is free to root out such unfaithful ministers, but the political costs of witch hunting can be high&mdash;as can be the efficiency costs of restructuring a government to discover an unfaithful minister without a full-blown purge.<br/><br/>In Damocles, each player directs the main force of his or her kingdom&rsquo;s government in all its intrigues, including from in exile. Each player may take part in what plots he or she likes&mdash;assassinations, intrusions, trade embargos, commodity dumps, briberies, overthrows&mdash;but must also improve his or her own kingdom&rsquo;s economy while solving the problem of the current potentate&rsquo;s succession, walking a fine line between enmity and cooperation with the kingdoms on every side. And if the government is subverted or the military stretched too thin, or the economy driven into futility, each ruler continues his or her work from exile, administering what government he or she can while resisting the occupying force before each other kingdom falls to the same opponent.<br/><br/>"}, "152790": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1910471.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"2790": {"name": "Bernd Eisenstein"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"179178": "Peloponnes Box"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"11933": "Matthias Catrein"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"9545": {"name": "Irongames"}}, "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1910471_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1050": {"name": "Ancient"}}, "description": "With this Expansion it is possible to sacrifice some of your inhabitants to gain secure points for your End-score.<br/>Those Inhabitants doesn't need to be fed, but they will also give you no coin-income.<br/><br/>Besides this, the expansion will have 3 new civilizations and will add another player (in color purple)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"228809": "First edition"}, "name": "Peloponnes: Sacrum Expansion", "playingtime": "10", "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "36", "expands": {"42910": {"name": "Peloponnes"}}, "average": "7.25278"}, "152791": {"boardgamedesigner": {"12665": {"name": "Hanno von Kemnitz"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Pinke Pinke", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1974", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1889048_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11": {"name": "F.X.

The rules are simple and generic/ universal, not bent on a specific genre. It is intended for atmospheric, story-oriented gaming with player empowerment, low-prep for the GM.<br/><br/>From the homepage &amp; game text:<br/><br/>Was ist Liquid?<br/><br/>Liquid ist ein genreunabh&auml;ngiges cinematisches und heroisches Rollenspiel, in dem es um Action- und Suspense-Geschichten geht, wie sie Hollywood erz&auml;hlt. Viele Rollenspiele besitzen so viele und so detaillierte Regeln, dass sie den Erz&auml;hlfluss guter Geschichten, das Darstellen von Charakteren und das atmosph&auml;rische Spiel behindern. Solche Spiele legen mehr Wert auf &ldquo;Realismus&rdquo; und &ldquo;Simulation&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Das oberste Ziel beim Design von Liquid war es, Regeln zu finden, die dich dabei unterst&uuml;tzen eine Geschichte zu erz&auml;hlen, Atmosph&auml;re zu erzeugen und interessante und unterhaltsame Charaktere zu spielen.<br/><br/>Die Regeln von Liquid sind flexibel, leicht und intuitiv verst&auml;ndlich, so dass du sie beim Spielen kaum bemerkst. Du wirst nicht jedesmal aus der stimmungsvollen Atmosph&auml;re der Spielrunde herausgerissen, sobald die W&uuml;rfel gerollt werden.<br/><br/>Auf diese Weise entlastet Liquid den Spielleiter und legt viel Verantwortung in die H&auml;nde der Spieler. Als Spielleiter solltest du dich auf die Beschreibung von Szenen, das Entwickeln von Plots und das Darstellen unterhaltsamer Nichtspielercharaktere konzentrieren k&ouml;nnen. Viele Regelwerke verlangen zu viel von Spielleitern: ein dickes Regelwerk auswendig lernen, das ganze Spiel verwalten und schlie&szlig;lich auch noch toll erz&auml;hlen und Nichtspielercharaktere stimmungsvoll spielen.<br/>Deswegen gibt es in Liquid keine Regelflut &ndash; daf&uuml;r aber viele Tipps und Tricks f&uuml;r gutes Rollenspiel.<br/><br/>Wir sind davon &uuml;berzeugt, dass jeder Spieler in einer Spielrunde verantwortungsvoll mit den Regeln umgehen kann, aus eigenem Interesse die Spielbalance wahrt und somit weder wichtiger noch unwichtiger f&uuml;r die Kampagne ist als der Spielleiter. Liquid unterst&uuml;tzt die Vorstellung, dass Spielleiter und Spieler zusammen ein Team bilden, um gemeinsam eine gro&szlig;e, spannende und heroische Geschichte zu erleben. Deswegen besteht Liquid nicht nur aus Regeltext, sondern auch aus vielen Tipps und Tricks, die dir dabei helfen, deine Rollenspielrunden als Spieler oder als Spielleiter so zu organisieren, dass alle mit der Zeit dazu in der Lage sind, Situationen im Rollenspiel mit Hilfe von gesundem Menschenverstand anstatt mit dem umst&auml;ndlichen Anwenden vieler Regeln zu l&ouml;sen.<br/><br/>Und das beste: Du musst nur ein einziges Mal Regeln lernen. Danach kannst du in jeder Welt spielen und in jedem Genre Abenteuer erleben.<br/><br/>"}, "152802": {"rpgitemversion": {"228824": "Card version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Short Order Heroes", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1895416.png", "usersrated": "4", "average": "8.4375", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"173": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpg": {"24241": "Short Order Heroes"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgpodcastepisode": {"106396": "Bonus Episode: Short Order Heroes"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1895416_t.png", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Fast, fun, rules-light roleplaying!<br/><br/>Each 108-card deck is:<br/><br/>- Full color art that illustrates each description<br/>- A complete role-playing system -- no need for dice, character sheets, or anything extra<br/>- a fast way to add color and character to existing games<br/>- An aspect generator for Fate Core-based games<br/>- Quick, easy, and fun to use<br/><br/>"}, "152804": {"rpg": {"23927": "HokusPokus"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "HokusPokus Gr\u00fcnhorn", "rpgproducer": {"71952": "Michaela Conrad"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1898281.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": {"228826": "PDF Version (3.

You will attempt to weave the most credible UFO story!<br/><br/>Mechanically, Pasture 51 is a stock (get it?) holding game, where players will decide which cattle they wish to hold while also deciding which cattle are legitimately abducted (adding to the credibility of the stories), which cattle simply pass away in the fields, and which cattle are involved in abduction hoaxes (which hurts the credibility of the stories).  There is one pasture card on the table for each of these outcomes, where cattle will graze before meeting their fate.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he will draw two livestock tokens from a bag, with livestock coming in four varieties.  He will choose one to keep in his personal stock, and one to put below a pasture card of his choice.<br/><br/>The backs of these tokens all contain special abilities as well.  When a token is put out into pasture, it is flipped into the air.  If it lands cattle-side up, too bad, no special ability.  If it lands ability-side up, the player will get to perform an ability such as moving a cattle to an adjacent pasture, swapping a cattle from his personal stock with one in the pastures, or witnessing an abduction, which moves a cattle token from grazing in the pasture up onto the pasture card, where it is locked for the rest of the game.  Abducting cattle while they are in the right pastures will be key to your success!<br/><br/>After a set number of turns, players will determine the value of each cattle variety.  Cattle involved in hoaxes will decrease that variety's value, while those that were abducted by the real deal will add to it.

In this game, players take turns playing the part of the industrious ants and the grasshopper content to sponge off the labor of the ants.<br/><br/>The Grasshopper &amp; the Ant includes two ways to play, but the heart of both is the same. At the start of the game, lay out 16 (of the 48) path cards in a 4x4 grid; each path card shows one of four types of landscapes. The ant player places six ants on these cards, one ant per card, with the ants forming a chain (as in real life), then secretly chooses one type of terrain on which at least one ant stands. The grasshopper player then stands with one of the ants, and if the grasshopper chose the same landscape as the ant player, the grasshopper takes all the path cards of this type on which an ant stands; if the grasshopper chose incorrectly, then the ant player takes these path cards. Either way, you then refill the 4x4 grid. The ant player keeps playing until she finally wins path cards, then the next player in clockwise order controls the ants. (In winter mode, the third and fourth players control red ants and receive a random path card if they match the choice of the ant player.)<br/><br/>In autumn mode, players score path cards immediately, with each type being tracked independently; path cards that feature insects are saved for a endgame bonus. As soon as a player maxes out two scoring tracks, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>In winter mode, players keep the path cards they collect in order to buy provision cards (worth one victory point), which cost particular combinations of path types. In this mode, when you win a path card that features an insect, you can claim another card in the grid that features the same insect. Collect both provision cards of the same type, and you score a bonus VP.

These creatures corrupt mortals not only with promises of carnal pleasure, but with wealth, power, everlasting life, and any other dark and twisted wish that the mortal mind can imagine. While even the lowest of these fell creatures carries great power, and the ability to bend reality to their will in order to corrupt a mortal soul, a select few glabrezus stand out above the rest as paragons of their kind. These are the mythic glabrezu.<br/><br/>This books presents game statistics for a mythic glabrezu, including several unique abilities never seen elsewhere. It also contains a selection of general mythic abilities that can be given to a wide variety of monsters when they are made mythic, with a special focus on abilities that are thematically appropriate for demons, devils, and other fiendish creatures. Finally, it includes rules for performing special rituals that can be enacted by players of any class in order to summon a mythic glabrezu, which come with both specific game rules for doing so and detailed flavorful descriptions.<br/><br/>The Mythic Mastery series of products builds and expands on the rules for mythic characters introduced in Mythic Adventures.

The very nature of the game means that spells, and spellcasting, work a certain way. While there are plenty of spells to choose from, eventually you reach a point where just casting the same old things over and over again gets boring. And that&rsquo;s where the books in the Advanced Arcana series come in.<br/><br/>Advanced Arcana Volume IV is more than just a collection of over 100 brand new, never-before-seen spells. It, like its critically-acclaimed predecessors, was specifically designed to challenge the status quo of the way that magic works in your game. Previous installments of Advanced Arcana have questioned the concept of spell slots, and created spells that modify other spells, or which can be cast at different spell levels for different effects. This installment turns its eyes to the boundaries between the schools of magic themselves, creating versatile alternate-school spells, which have different effects depending on which school they are cast as, and powerful dual-school spells, whose effects are so potent that they cannot be contained by a single school of magic. This book also contains the return of the popular fountain spells, which allow you to restore a used spell slot to your mind after casting them.<br/><br/>But even above and beyond Advanced Arcana Volume IVs numerous groundbreaking new spells that will have you rethinking what you thought you knew about magic, the book contains a number of expansive appendices on such topics as&hellip;<br/><br/>     &hellip;creating a place of power from which a spellcaster can draw additional magical might.<br/>     &hellip;training to master specific spells in order to be able to get more from casting them.<br/>     &hellip;a brand new base class, the elite arcanist, that gains access to spells from all spell lists.<br/>     &hellip;and more!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve already experienced one of the previous installments of Advanced Arcana, you know that this book is not to be missed.

If you need rules to protect players from GMs or GMs from players, this game is not for you.<br/><br/>"}, "152894": {"rpg": {"24246": "Noitahovi"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Noitahovi s\u00e4\u00e4nt\u00f6kirja", "rpgproducer": {"72597": "Tuomas Kortelainen"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1882807.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"228975": "Rulebook"}, "average": "7", "rpggenre": {"1013": "Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1882807_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Noitahovi is a roleplaying game from the dark North, in which women strong in magic rule.

See if you can help Super Gran to crush that Evil Scunner Campbell and his boys Tub and Rent-A-Muscle.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Super Gran was a 1980s kids TV show produced by Tyne Tees Television in the UK (with a theme tune sung by Billy Connolly no-less!). A little old Scottish pensioner is hit by a magic ray, giving her super-powers - turning her into Super Gran! The TV show revolved around her foiling the plans of the 'scunner' (rough translation - 'scumbag') Campbell. She was ably assisted by her Grandson Willard and Inventor Black, who created various weird and wonderful machines.<br/><br/>These machines play a key part in the Super Gran game. For example the first 'Sheet' (stage) of the game involves a flying bike above the streets of Chiselton battling against ... an identical flying bike (apparently this is an imposter Super Gran). The next screen has Super Gran equipped with an Anti-Gravity Belt, which she uses to pick up cats to stop them being run over by cars. While flying she must avoid hot air balloons and low-flying jet aircraft(!). For reasons not explained, she can only move left and right on the screen while airborne. Further screens are equally bizarre.<br/><br/>Receiving hits resets the stage and Super Gran loses one point of her 'Superness' meter.

Each player gets a bingo tablet which has the numbers 1-15. In the middle of the table, the chips come. There always three quizzes played. In the first round of quiz is about the four corner squares on the bingo tablet. Who could cover these fields with answer chip first, wins that round. The moderator asks a question from the question stack, the player who first gets &quot;BINGO&quot;, then may say the solution. If you are correct, he or she is allowed to occupy a corner with a chip, the answer is wrong, the player has to suspend for one round.  Once all questions have been asked a map, the next red card is drawn. Once all of the corner squared occupied, the winner gets 5 points credited, all the other players get as many pluses as they have covered chips. After the second game round begins. The chips from the first round, however, remain lying on the tablet. During the second round should you fill the middle of the first three rows of chips, also get all the players according to the number of chips on the tablet points in payroll. The winner will be credited 10 points this time. As the yellow question cards are taken. And here, the chips remain on the panel. In the third round, the game works gain similar to the previous one has here blue cards, the player must now cover all remaining fields with chips and the winner gets 20 points added to his or her account. Those who could collect the most points after all three rounds, may eventually challenge the Super Bingo round. If he or she wins the round, so doubled his/her score. Otherwise, they halved. We play with final game screen, which is a 5x5 large square with the number 1-25. Now the hourglass comes to train. The player has the task within 60 seconds to form a line of 5 fields with the chips either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. It is also worked here with the blue question cards. The player always calls the first field which he/she must prove with a chip, then reads the question before the host. If this answered correctly, a white chip is placed on the field, otherwise a black chip is placed. Now the player is called quickly to the next field on which he/she would place his/her stone.<br/><br/>The game ends after 60 seconds.

The Russians get three M4/76(a)s, loaded to the gills with Smoke and the awesome Smoke Mortar, while the thin German force, centered around four 6-5-8 squads and three lesser 4-4-7 SS squads and supported by a halftrack and a mortar, try to delay the Russians long enough to reduce the VP value of the buildings, thus forcing the Russians to Exit more VP in order to win. There is a very interesting &quot;semi-random&quot; Russian rolling barrage of 70mm Harassing Fire that can impede both sides. Two StuGs show up later in the game to bolster the defense.
