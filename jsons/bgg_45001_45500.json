The leaders of the kobolds are a sly shaman and a mighty warrior. The kobold brothers maraud the wagons of poor villagers in the vale below.

Of course, such a myth has little basis in the truth of things, but it is an interesting postulation. There is no doubt that the race of creatures known as lizardfolk, or lizardmen, is an ancient one indeed. Often overlooked because of their savagery and animalistic tendencies, the lizardfolk people are as much a part of the history of the world as men, dwarves and elves.<br/><br/>As a reptilian race, lizardfolk prefer to live in the warmer parts of the world, in swamps and marshes throughout such climates. They often build settlements of dome-like mud huts deep within swamps, hidden away and guarded against outsiders who would harm the tribe. Lizardfolk are unpredictable within their habitat - sometimes dealing peacefully with outsiders, sometimes attacking them ferociously. Adventurers travelling through swampland should be vigilant - their passing will almost certainly be known to the near invisible lizardfolk sentries but they may never realise that they were being watched.

Bearing down on their prey with lance, claws and stinger twitching, the folk make short work of their targets taking what they will; food valuables and other treasure. Most caravan routes through the hot barren lands avoid known hot spots of scorpionfolk activity, but it is not always possible to gauge where they will hit.

A means of garnering plenty of experience points, but not a serious challenge to a well-equipped party with a spellcaster or two and the first clue about tactics. Such a complacent attitude can be very dangerous, particularly if the giants use their natural advantages to maximum effect.<br/><br/>Giants are often first encountered singly or in small family groups, either menacing a local community or preying on travellers through mountainous country. At higher levels they may be found in larger tribes, often working with lesser creatures such as ettins, trolls and even lowly orcs, along with the occasional powerful enemy such as a dragon. With almost as much versatility as the typical humanoid creature, most giant races are capable of advancing in character classes, and whether simple barbarians to capitalise on their obvious strengths or more dangerous classes such as the much-feared giant sorcerers, adepts, and clerics, these advanced giants can provide a serious boost to the challenge set by any giant encounter.<br/><br/>This present volume comprises knowledge drawn from scholarly studies alongside tactics and survival tips offered by adventurers who have tangled with giants and lived to tell the tale.

Though wearing the form of a simple animal, the winter wolf's cunning and intellect approaches that of humankind, making these creatures far more dangerous than their physical appearance would indicate. <br/>Built like a common wolf and yet standing taller than the fiercest dwarven warrior, a winter wolf is equally at home in the snow-laden wastes of the deep arctic or the towering heights of jagged, windswept mountains. During the heaviest blizzard, when all that can be seen are swirling shades of white in all directions, the winter wolves prowl for food, heedless of the ice matting their pelts or the cold winds sweeping across their lupine faces. When fierce winter storms send sheets of freezing hail and sleet screaming across the snow-swept plains, and even the heartiest arctic inhabitants nestle deep into hidden burrows for warmth and safety, packs of winter wolves range the white wastes, seeking their prey. Silently they stalk their unknowing quarry, slipping ghostlike through the snow-filled landscape, their tracks quickly erased by the howling arctic winds. Discovering a lone victim struggling through the bleak landscape, they add their own howls of triumph to the voice of the wind. Hearing this, the victim knows with dire certainty that all hope is gone, for none can evade these lords of the cold-lands for long. . .<br/><br/>Within these pages you will find detailed information on winter wolf physiology, habitat, and society, giving you a basic overview on how this race exists and interacts with the rest of the world. Players can learn winter wolf hunting tactics and Games Masters are given guidelines on how to introduce winter wolves into their existing campaigns. They will also benefit from material demonstrating how to portray winter wolves to the players, so that they stand out from the normal wolf.

Finally, a complete winter wolf lair is featured to be used as either an extended encounter or as an example of how such lairs are generally laid out.<br/><br/>Written by the author of so many &lsquo;Ecology&rsquo; articles within Dragon magazine, The Slayer&rsquo;s Guide to Winter Wolves is the ultimate resource for any player or Games Master daring to adventure within the cold lands of the north.<br/><br/>Inside You Will Find <br/><br/>     Winter Wolf Physiology: Growing to over eight feet long and breathing blasts of icy cold wind, they are no ordinary wolf and their raw strength enables them to overcome the greatest dangers of the arctic lands. <br/>     Habitat: The majority of winter wolves are found in the cold regions of the arctic and subarctic climates. There they live as wild and free as their smaller brethren, those unhampered by the burdens of intellect and civilisation. Most winter wolf packs live a simple life, worried only about their next meal, next hunt, and next litter. They are the undisputed masters of their wintry realm, living off the land and looking only to their own abilities for survival. <br/>     Winter Wolf Society: Learn about the dominant nature of winter wolf packs and how they steal young infants of other intelligent races in order to raise them as foundlings. Also discover the terrible fate of the runt of each litter. <br/>     Methods of Warfare: Winter wolves prefer to attack en masse as a pack rather than fight individually, however, their enhanced intelligence allows them to fight more far effectively on the battlefield. <br/>     Role-Playing with Winter Wolves: These highly intelligent and cunning creatures are no mere canine. Games Master can now learn how to portray winter wolves in a manner that befits their stature and make any such encounter memorable in the minds of his players. <br/>     Scenario Hooks &amp; Ideas: Several ideas to get winter wolves into your campaigns and thoroughly introduce them to players.. <br/>     Brute&rsquo;s Lair: A complete winter wolf pack, plus a human foundling, ready to be dropped into any existing campaign world. <br/>     The Winter Wolf Reference List: The essential guide to all winter wolves, from the lowest pup to the great alpha male who dominates all beneath him<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "45109": {"rpgartist": ["Brent Chumley", "Gillian Pearce"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "PDF Version"], "rpgseries": ["The Slayer's Guides"], "name": "The Slayer's Guide to Minotaurs", "rpgdesigner": ["Shawn McKee"], "rpgproducer": ["Ian Barstow", "Ted Chang", "Alexander Fennell"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic790830.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "4", "rpgissuearticle": ["Review Corner"], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "poll": [], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic790830_t.jpg", "description": "Masters of the Labyrinth<br/>Many adventurers are familiar with the minotaur, at least in general terms.

Can your guild sweep through its districts and gain power through recruiting influential citizens and acquiring valuable relics?<br/><br/>The revised edition of Arcana is a card game of recruitment and resource gathering for 2-4 crafty leaders. Command a guild of loyal agents during a series of district encounters against your opponents. Score the most prominent citizens, advantageous locations, and valuable treasures through bribery and power struggles. Collect the highest amount of victory points to become the master guild of Cadwallon!<br/><br/>This vibrant game creates a fantastical atmosphere for players to enjoy while they attempt to best their opponents through strategic card play. Make your guild the most influential by winning Stake cards and strengthening your deck with impressive Personalities, advantageous Locations, or tempting Relics to use in bribery.<br/><br/>The revised edition of Arcana introduces two new guilds to choose from, the Guild of Fortune-tellers and the Guild of Architects, as well a variety of optional rules that players can utilize to enhance their experience. Players can customize their guild, fulfill objectives, recruit Militia, invoke the ability of their Guild Masters, affect game play through random events, or optimize tactical strategy through card discards. Which variant will you use in your game?<br/><br/>Summary of Play<br/><br/>Arcana is played over a series of rounds that are comprised of two phases, the Intrigue phase and the Resolution phase. Send Agents from your unique guild deck to any of Cadwallon&rsquo;s districts to claim control of Stake cards: Personalities, Locations, and Relics, all of which award victory points.<br/><br/>During these district encounters players gain control of Stake cards by playing their Agent cards. Stake cards are won through meeting or exceeding the card&rsquo;s main arcanum: either Military, Political, Spiritual, or Financial.

To all outward appearances they are a normal human being, like you or me, and it is only by their strange behaviour and by very close (often post-mortem) physical examination that they are revealed to be anything other than Homo Sapiens. Scholars are in agreement that Rules-Lawyers have been around at least as long as games of any kind have existed. Some go as far as to say they have existed as long as rules themselves have existed in this universe. <br/>They are said to have lived among us, alongside man and his more primitive and slope headed ancestors since time itself began, waiting for them to lose interest in football and develop the wheel.<br/><br/>There is a school of thought that accredits God Almighty with being the supreme, original, Rules-Lawyer. What other kind of consciousness would have the necessary mindset and tenacity to come up with every single one of the laws of nature and physics, the way the biosphere interacts with it's complex ecological niches, the way the various chemicals mix and react with one another, the force of gravity, the laws of thermodynamics and all the other sundry little rules of the universe that we all have to live with day to day. Rules-Lawyers refer to this particular aspect of the divine as 'The Source', that from which all rules are spawned. The rest of us tend to refer to it as 'A pain in the arse.' Especially when we find ourselves dropping buttered toast or searching for missing socks in the back of the washing machine.<br/><br/>When the first amino acid chains formed in the primeval oceans Lawyers were there, tutting at their organic molecule cousins and telling them that they could not possibly do that. When a few primitive cells got together and decided to cooperate with each other, they were there, bluntly protesting that such a thing was impossible and could only lead to trouble. When the first amphibious fish fitfully dragged themselves onto dry land to test their flippers on soil, the Rules-Lawyers were shouting that nothing good would come of it and that it went against all precedent. After all, did it not say on page 37 of the 'Fish Scales &amp; Clamshells' player's guide that 'Dry Land' meant instant doom to all who travelled there? In Egypt they ruled the land with their geometry and their religious laws, adding more and wilder gods to their pantheon and more and more religious observances until every day of the year was a religious holiday with full pay and the empire collapsed. In the Middle Ages they were the ones who sided with Prince John and the Sheriff Of Nottingham against Robin Hood (after all, he was breaking the law of the land, whatever his motives). Just this morning you may have met one of this ancient breed telling you . . .<br/><br/>'You can't park there mate, not even for just a couple of minutes while you unload. Its more than my job's worth.'<br/><br/>But it is not in 'Real Life' that they most make their terrible presence felt, reality is fluid, mercurial, changing, the laws of physics and of life have yet to be completely discovered and pinned down, opinions change as often as hairstyles, theories override each other on a daily basis. There does exist within the Rules-Lawyer's hearts the faint hope that on one glorious day all of reality will conform to The Rules and be under their sway but with Chaos Theory still in vogue the Rules-Lawyers are filled with such an abiding sense of dread that they find themselves seeking refuge in the one place they can be sure of how everything works.<br/><br/>"}, "45188": {"rpgdesigner": ["Marco Behrmann", "Carl Johan Str\u00f6m", "Krister Sundelin"], "rpgitemversion": ["Soft cover version"], "poll": [], "name": "NeoTech Nippon", "rpgartist": ["Peter Bergting", "Ola Nilsson", "Carl Johan Str\u00f6m"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic772783.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "average": "5.83333", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["NeoTech"], "rpgpublisher": ["Neogames"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Cyberpunk)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic772783_t.jpg", "description": "NeoTech Nippon is a sourcebook that is all about the Far East with a focus on Japan.

The dread shrine to the frogmen deity occupies a central position in this level and it is probably the first thing an adventurer will see upon arriving in this place. A great corridor runs all around the complex, like a ring. This corridor is actually the main defense system of the whole complex, since it has double the height of the other rooms and, on the highest part of it, rows of deadly arrow slits are set.<br/><br/>The level 1 is where the main armed force of the frogmen is detached. They have the duty to defend the lower and upper levels of the complex. Arrow slits corridors allow the guards to fire deadly missiles over unaware intruders walking around the corridors of the lower level. The arrow slits corridors are flanked by dozens of armories containing every sort of missile weapons. Nearby storage rooms hosts peach and other throw-down materials that can be used when in need. Furthermore, murder holes are scattered everywhere on this level allowing to fire in any room and corridor below.<br/><br/>The level 3 is the uppermost level. This was the first dwelling of the frogmen, now abandoned. Mostly a cave complex, this level has become in time the home of all sorts of underground predators. In a large cavern you can find a pit overlooking the very shrine of the frogmen, although it is nearly 300 ft down.

By contrast, Trist is often sad and worried, and prefers tragedies and plays of great intellectual value (but sometimes questionable entertainment). The Theatre offers one or two shows during the week, with tickets starting at 1 cp. Popular recent productions include Invorath&rsquo;s Ten Lunches, The Death of Bor Greybottle, The Fat Dwarf in Love, and The Monster of the Woods.<br/><br/>9 - Militia Barracks: A local militia was founded twenty-five years ago to protect Fourwell from external threats (mostly wandering monsters and bandits) and respond to internal emergencies (thieves, fire, and so on).

Perhaps, the cairn is the most fascinating fantasy location ever and, certainly, it is the most played in fantasy RPGs. Traditionally, the cairns are filled with precious treasures, ancient belongings of defunct heroes and, of course, sleepless monsters. Undeads roam the silent underhalls and guard the forgotten crypts, waiting eagerly for some fools who dare to descend in the darkness of their domains. In this product, you will find five different cairns you can use in your adventures. The cairns may be used as part of a greater complex or individually.<br/>Here are some adventure hooks.<br/><br/>Round Cairn: While in another dungeon, the PCs find themselves transported in this cairn, appearing on one of the Gate Rooms. The gates of the cairn begin to produce monsters at constant rate, and the PCs must find a way out before being overwhelmed. Perhaps the key for opening the entrance portal lie in the central room, but some riddles must be overcome as well.<br/>Emperor&rsquo;s Cairn: The good emperor lies in his death slumber from thousand years. It is said he was put to sleep by magic, for unknown reason. Now, a young scholar has found the key to awake the man and bring a good ruler to the world. The forces of evil try to destroy the remains of the king by awakening dreaded undeads from their graves in the cairn. The PCs are hired to retrieve the remains of the emperor and perform the ritual to awake him but they must confront the undead rising into the tomb.<br/>King&rsquo;s Cairn: The PCs are searching the crown of an ancient king into the cairn. They find it in the sepulcher but if worn, the crown turns the PC into a powerful lich, who awake all the undead into the cairn. The only way to escape, for the PCs, is to spark again the loyalty in the undead that were the King&rsquo;s Guard and persuade them to fight for their king.<br/>Ruined Cairn: The PCs venture into a ruined cairn, which is infested by goblins. They discover ancient memorials of a disappeared race. When they arrive to battle with the goblin leader, they discover he is a strange crossbreed. The PCs will be able to defeat him only if they have gathered enough clues from the ancient cairn.<br/>Multilevel Cairn: A strange spell has been cast on this cairn; it influences the alignment of the undeads who guard the ancient treasures. The PCs are caught in a war erupting in the cairn. The key is an evil necromancer who seeks a lost artifact kept into the cairn and found a funny way to destroy the guarding undeads.<br/><br/>"}, "45216": {"rpgartist": ["Chris Appel", "Janet Aulisio", "Steve Bryant", "Paul Daly", "Amy Doubet", "Larry Elmore", "LaMont Fullerton", "Daniel Gelon", "Darrell Midgette", "David O.

It was undoubtedly built to defend one side of the mountain; the other side faces friendly people and has no need of strong defenses. The dwarven engineers built the stronghold near a subterranean river in order to exploit the power of water to build a dwarven wonder: a raising underwater bridge. The bridge is the major defense of the west side of the stronghold. The entire bridge, due to a gigantic device working like a dam, can disappear under the waves of a mountain lake, thus preventing the access to the main portal of the stronghold. Should the enemies manage to go through the portal, they would find a formidable line of defense made of ballistas, murder holes, arrowslits and stone guardians. The stronghold consists of five levels intertwined with a number of staircases heavily guarded. Each level has its own purpose. The level 0 houses soldiers and jails, as well as forges and shrines. Level 1 houses more soldiers (these two levels are self-sufficient, being provided of kitchens and larders) Level 2 is dedicated to the nobles, with great halls of statues, an arena and nobles&rsquo; quarters. Level 3, the topmost one, is the main temple area complete with the crypts for the dwarven heroes. The last level (-1) is the dam level. Here the dwarven engineers work and keep maintenance of their device, also there is the bridge control room. Some hints to use the stronghold follow:<br/><br/>     The adventurers must cross the mountain. The sole way is through the friendly stronghold of the dwarves. Unluckily the stronghold has fallen in the hand of orcs and the PCs will have to run through the fortress avoiding warbands of bloodthirsty orcs.<br/>     The PCs are crossing the stronghold, they must exit from the west side, but something terrible has happened. An unnamed evil has risen from the depth of the underground river killing everything at the dam level. The dwarves are scared and will not dare to descend below. The PCs must descend and find out what has happened, trying to operate the device in order to exit from the stronghold.<br/>     The PCs are guests of the dwarven commander in the stronghold, they are treated like honor guests and the dwarves set up a feast for them. Actually, a vampire lord took residence in the stronghold more than a year ago and he is now lacking food, having infected the entire dwarven garrison.

The Dock Ward features many small alleys and streets that eventually end down to the docks. The docks are the trade link of the city; here there is always bustling activity as the ships come and go at every time of the night and day. Here, of course, many illegal activities are hidden and shady individuals move in and out the salt-smelling alleys and tavern of the Dock Ward. Numerous taverns and inns are placed on the very front end of the buildings, facing the great harbor of the city. Diving in the back alleys you can find even more entertaining places, such as houses of pleasure, gambling houses and so on. This blueprint features six of these buildings. The number of the building refers to the map available in the Great City blueprint. Some descriptions of these buildings follow.<br/><br/><br/>     1 - Lighthouse: Two of these lighthouses flank the entrance to the Great City harbor. These tall structures mark the entrance of the harbor at night and during the stormy weather days. A single guardian takes care of each building, feeding the fire of beacon lantern on top of the building. The lighthouse features a wood storage that is loaded every day from local woodcutters. An elevator lifts the wood up to the beacon lantern.<br/>     2 - The Golden Eel Inn: This is the best Inn of the Dock Ward. The inn features a large reception hall, a restaurant (which is often visited even by people who are not inn&rsquo;s guests) and a small parlor. The first floor features guests&rsquo; bedrooms and a private meeting room for wealthy patrons.<br/>     4 - Warehouses: This set of buildings houses three distinct warehouses. The first one functions as boats garaging; the fishermen of the harbor pay a little fee to keep their boats here. The second one is a warehouse of salted herrings. The third one contains various tools of the trade for mariners and fishermen.<br/>     5 - Djanna, House of Pleasure: This is a well-known house of pleasure of the Dock Ward. The house features a large foyer and some private parlors where guests can entertain and talk. Often these places become secret meeting places for most of the organized criminals of the city. On the first floor there are many large bedrooms as well as storerooms.<br/>     6 - Dock: This is a typical pier of the Great City. Different types of ships usually crowd the water near the pier: drifters, rowboats, fishing boats and merchant ships.<br/>     10 - The Shy Mermaid Tavern: This tavern is located in the north end of the harbor. The tavern is the favorite meeting place for people who conduct shady activities. The tavern has a private meeting room and a back courtyard with stables where not-so-legal goods are delivered during the night and exchanged by these outlaws.<br/><br/><br/>"}, "45242": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mario Barbati"], "rpgitemversion": ["Electronic Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Great City, Trades Ward", "rpgartist": ["Guido Barbati", "O'Bully"], "rpgproducer": ["Anna Fava"], "usersrated": "1", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic676763.jpg", "rpgmechanic": ["Dice (Primarily d20)"], "rpgsetting": ["The Great City"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["\u00d8one Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["\u00d8one's Blueprints"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic676763_t.jpg", "description": "From the Publisher:<br/><br/>The Trades Ward is the beating commercial hearth of the Great City.

However the shop is not so small as it seems. A door leads upstairs to the second section of the shop, where only some customers are allowed. A secret door in this second shop leads in a top-secret area, where many strange and sometimes illegal objects are sold.<br/>     3 - Alchemist: This small shop is busy at all times.

The village is surrounded by wood and is linked to the rest of the world by a main road. Wodfeld is small but has everything a good group of adventures may need: a general store, a blacksmith, an inn, a very small temple, a watermill and a cemetery plus some farm houses. Wodfeld is the perfect place to start over a campaign and the best place to put on the adventurer&rsquo;s way. An adventure set in Wodfeld already exists and it is called Earth Unleashed (OSRIC).<br/>Some hints to use the hamlet follows:<br/><br/>     The PCs arrive in Wodfeld, where weird things are happening. They witness sand and stones falling from the sky, accompanied by a mild earthquake. The local druid claims it is the work of Mother Nature, who wants the loggers gone. The PCs are asked to investigate the disappearance of two lumberjacks... (this leads to the Earth Unleashed adventure)<br/>     A vampire plagues the hamlet of Wodfeld. During the night, the inhabitants of Wodfeld bar their doors and windows. The PCs are hired to hunt down the monster. The vampire was, in life, a ranger; he is very sly and leaves false traces leading to the near wood, toward many monsters&rsquo; lairs. The vampire sleeps in the cemetery in a tomb without name.<br/>     A group of bandits harass the hamlet of Wodfeld. They make raids and plunder at least every 15 days. One of the villagers, tired of this harassment, leaves the hamlet for a distant and ancient temple, asking the solitary god to help him. The god gave the villager the power to defeat the bandits: a shapechanging amulet that would turn him in a fierce beast, unfortunately the beast was utterly evil. The man returns to the hamlet and arrive in the same moment the PCs and the bandits enter the hamlet...<br/>     While resting in the hamlet, the PCs witness the kidnapping of a child. A dark, looming figure snatches the child and fly away. The villagers refuse to speak about the fact and ignore it completely. A dark cult, with members among the most prominent villagers, makes human sacrifices to a dark deity. The cult hideout is found in forgotten catacombs below the House of Prayers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "45245": {"rpgdesigner": ["Mario Barbati"], "rpgitemversion": ["Electronic Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Lost City", "rpgartist": ["Guido Barbati", "O'Bully"], "rpgproducer": ["Anna Fava"], "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic676713.jpg", "rpgmechanic": ["Dice (Primarily d20)"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "rpgpublisher": ["\u00d8one Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["\u00d8one's Blueprints"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic676713_t.jpg", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>The Lost City is the most prized adventure ground for the player characters.

Choosing to leave an Earth isolated by quarantine, the humans must find ways to understand the incomprehensible beings they meet, and find a place for themselves in the new world around them.<br/><br/>Working together, players create a truly alien environment using mechanics inspired by mad-libs: random words are chosen as creative spring-boards for describing the beings and world around the humans.

It is more a game about economics and game theory than about China and its neighbors, however. Routes in \u8cbf\u6613\u4e4b\u8def (M&agrave;oy&igrave;zh\u012bl&ugrave; - trade roads), the 'trade roads' of the title are chains of trading posts / inns etc. that you as a merchant can choose to use. All trade roads can be used by all players. Shipping fees are payed to the 'shipping company' that controls that trade road. There's shipping by sea as well, which works a tiny little bit differently.<br/><br/>The players, rich merchants, decide which shipping company invests where and how. They do this by buying cubes of the color of that shipping company. The cubes bought can be put on the map as sections of trade roads (or harbors), or they can be kept in the player's stock as 'influence' in that shipping company. The profits of a shipping company are divided by ratio of such influence cubes. Hence, owning more cubes means a larger share of the profit. However, a shipping company can only make a profit if it has many trade roads, many cubes on the map. Therefore, cube hoarders get a large share of nothing, and a player that spends all his cubes on roads gets a tiny share or even nothing of - potentially - a lot.<br/><br/>Of course, the profit a shipping company makes is entirely dependent on whether the roads (and harbors) of that company are actually used. Players decide what to ship from what location to what other location. Of course, the choice is driven by profit maximization.<br/>There are 10 locations on the map. 7 of these are Chinese cities. The other 3 are foreign locations. In all locations, three (out of five total) goods are traded. Prices are set randomly at the beginning of the game, but after that they depend on trade. Buying goods in a market makes the price of that good increase. Selling goods in a market makes the price of that good decrease.<br/><br/>And, rather importantly, all players (secretly) plan their trades at the same time. Plans are revealed simultaneously, and then carried out one after the other. Only after all players have made their trades, the market prices change.<br/><br/>"}, "45325": {"rpgdesigner": ["Rob Baxter", "Scott Bennie", "Joseph Carriker", "Bob Fitch", "Bruce H.

Surrounded by a pair of walled, tiered gardens, the tower thrusts 150 feet into the Zamoran sky, a perfect cylinder crowned with gems. Unmarred by doors or windows, the tower seems remote, impenetrable and alien, a spire utterly out of place in Arenjun. It is the abode of Yara the priest, and home to the Elephant&rsquo;s Heart, thought to be the most valuable jewel in the world, and the secret of Yara&rsquo;s power. <br/><br/>Throughout Arenjun and all of Zamora, rumours of the tower are as thick as flies in the Maul, the rotting slum of Arenjun where thieves, murderers and mercenaries mingle with lunatics, prostitutes and fugitives in a lawless orgy of decadence and revelry. It is said that the tower was built in the space of a single night, and is formed of pure silver, blindingly bright by day but glimmering like water beneath the wan light of the moon. Brave men whisper in fear of the stories of its bestial and alien guardians, ceaselessly patrolling the gardens, and of the legions of guards manning the tower&rsquo;s lowest levels. Of what lurks in the upper levels, where the great gem lies, the rumours seem more as if they are nightmares given voice than anything which could be real. No matter the verity of the rumours, one thing is absolute truth &ndash; the tower and its master are talismans of terror, even to the fearless rogues of Zamora. Despite the fabulous wealth it surely contains, no thief has yet had the courage to assay Yara&rsquo;s cursed tower &ndash; at least, none have tried and lived. <br/><br/>The Tower of the Elephant is the first in a new series of Conan adventure scenarios from Mongoose Publishing. Based directly on the original story by Robert E. Howard, The Tower of the Elephant allows the Player Characters to undertake the very adventures that made Conan the legend he is. In the case of an adventure like The Tower of the Elephant, this will mean that Conan himself did not undertake to scale the tower and steal the gem.<br/><br/>These scenarios give Player Characters the opportunity to test their mettle against the greatest of all adventurers &ndash; Conan of Cimmeria. Can they survive the trials otherwise set before him? Have they the courage, the stoutness of heart, clearness of mind and strength of sinew to walk the path trod by the mighty barbarian? The Tower of the Elephant will test not only their capacity for violence, stealth and greed, but for mercy, subtlety and intuition as well. Player Characters who rely solely on the might of their sword arms to resolve problems will likely learn a hard (and potentially fatal) lesson within the bejeweled walls of the Elephant Tower. Have they the mettle and skill to tread where Conan might have walked?<br/><br/>The Tower of the Elephant is intended for a party of four to six Player Characters of 2nd or 3rd level, preferably representing a range of character classes.<br/><br/>"}, "45379": {"rpgartist": ["Jon Hodgson", "Tony Parker", "Toby Whitty"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "Conan and the Heretics of Tarantia", "rpgdesigner": ["Greg Lynch", "Wilson Phillips"], "rpgproducer": ["Ian Belcher", "Alexander Fennell", "Mark Lewin", "Richard Neale"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic503941.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": ["Hyborian Age"], "average": "5.66667", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Conan: The Roleplaying Game"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic503941_t.jpg", "description": "A foully murdered priest of Mitra sets the Player Characters upon a course of investigation and adventure, searching for the culprit in a quest that takes them from the greatest halls of the city to the lowest dregs.

Thieves. Temptresses. The fallen classes of the Hyborian age live amongst the shadows, lurking and hiding in the dark recesses of every city. Civilised people often presume rules come from the gods or even from strange books wherein the &lsquo;Truth' is written. Actions are either correct or incorrect and a culture of guilt arises from violating the tenets laid down by society. Societies who try to live by those rules breed shadows and these shadows are the fallen classes, by-products of all the impulses contrary to a given society's definitions of truth and order. Some consider the shadows evil, others see them as a necessity. Many long to give in to the shadows but pretend to condemn them. The fiercest; barbarians, nomads and borderers, are forces of nature impacting upon society. The finest; nobles, scholars and soldiers, are the creators and maintainers of society and 'law' itself. The fallen represent impulsive temptation; those who reject the 'Truth' insisted upon by the finest and challenged by the fiercest. To be one of the fallen is to be hunted by the so-called &lsquo;finest&rsquo; elements of society. To be one of the fallen is to have your deeds and beliefs treated as sinful, criminal or worse.<br/><br/>"}, "45382": {"rpgartist": ["Jon Hodgson", "Rhonda Libbey", "Stephen Shepherd"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version", "Softcover version"], "poll": [], "name": "Conan and the Lurking Terror of Nahab", "rpgdesigner": ["Bryan Steele"], "rpgproducer": ["Ron Bedison", "Ian Belcher", "Alexander Fennell", "Richard Neale"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic503939.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["Hyborian Age"], "average": "7.2", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Conan: The Roleplaying Game"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Sword & Sorcery)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic503939_t.jpg", "description": "Nestled at the feet of the Karpash Mountains in Corinthia, on the Road of Kings is a bustling city run by noble landlords and toiled by thousands of peasants from all walks of life &ndash; Nahab.

In near-future science fiction, the line between the two is often imperceptible. Still, subtle (and not-so-subtle) differences arise, especially when it comes to life in space. Telling a believable, realistic story of near-future science fiction without getting bogged down in too much detail can be a monumental chore for Gamemasters and Players who wish to explore the Saga of Mankind in the 23rd Century.<br/><br/>The Spacer's Guide provides Gamemasters and Players alike with the background details of ordinary life in space in the Jovian Chronicles game setting. It explores the ways in which Mankind may change in 200 years' time in that environment, and it shows how it will likely remain the same. This manual fills in the gaps between the broad descriptions of the spacer's way of life that have already appeared in the Jovian Chronicles game line.

You sum up the screen presence of all protagonists, double that number, and add three. In other words: 2x(screen presence)+3.<br/><br/>- Instead of a 3/2 split for traits, protagonists now have a 2/1 split.<br/><br/>- Conflicts are now resolved via cards. Instead of odds, count red cards, and use hearts as trump if you have a tie. If there&rsquo;s still a tie, look for the highest heart.<br/><br/>- Instead of high die narrating, it&rsquo;s now high card. Red cards beat black cards, hearts beat diamonds and spades beat clubs.<br/><br/>- Aside from the rules changes, there&rsquo;s a lot of little stuff here and there. I added a couple new sample shows, revised some text, and added a ton of examples in the text.

While the Marvel Super Heroes Original Set (MSHOS -the yellow box) was a down-and dirty, cola-and-pretzels, dirt-simple introduction to role-playing, this product is different. This product assumes you know what you&rsquo;re doing.<br/><br/>Unlike the Original Set, this set starts with the basic assumption that you have played RPGs before, most likely the Original Set. (For those who have wandered into this book despite the big letters declaring that this is an Advanced set, don&rsquo;t worry- we summarize the major points from the previous set as we go along, both for your benefit and players of the Original who don&rsquo;t want to be flipping between two books.) You know what role-playing is. You&rsquo;ve had characters that could web-spin up a storm, could wall-crawl with the best of them, and those that were the best at what they did (snikkt!). Now you&rsquo;re ready for more than your standard going toe-to-toe with the Hulk. This set of two books (a 96-page Players&rsquo; Book and a 64-page Judge&rsquo;s Book), along with additional cards, maps, and stand-ups is for you.<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t let the size of this product, the amount of text included, put you off. Some is familiar ground, further explanations of FEAT rolls and abilities that have developed in the two years since the creation of MSHOS. Ideas that have worked their way in by a variety of support products, by a number of different hands, are brought together here, clarified, and codified. Most are new expansions on the rules of the game, retaining the basic mechanics of the game but breaking them out into a fuller campaign sense, Resources. Popularity, the new Contacts section, all of these are brand new, designed to add depth to your characters and campaigns. The nature of your own heroes is changed, as we fill in the gaps in the Universal Table, allowing for more rapid advancement, and concentrating on the hero that YOU want to create. New combat strategies are dealt with, along with the use of Powers in combat.<br/><br/>But before I spin off into comic-book hyperbole, let me state: this is an expansion, not a revision. Certain game mechanics have been modified, but the game is designed to retain the flavor and basic rules of the original, and any adventure written previously for the Original Set should be equally at home with the Advanced Set, The only difference is the players have a lot more options available to them, The Original Set is neither reduced nor outdated by this product, and will remain as an introduction to Role-Playing, the starting point from which this only offers new frontiers and options.<br/><br/>This new book provides a lot of options. New combat tactics, including blindsiding, shockwaves, and the ever-loving fastball special. New equipment, new weapons, and new vehicles, New ways for the characters to spend their money, New things to build. A lot of new Powers, and more information on the old ones.<br/><br/>All in all, there is enough in here to give you, the players, a new lease on your super-heroic lives, and enough ideas to keep you, the Judge, hopping. Of course, the Judge&rsquo;s Book contains a similar amount of information on how to handle the players. Fair is fair.<br/><br/>As noted above, this book comes from the thoughts, comments, and input of a number of sources. Kim Eastland developed the magic system in the form which you see here and beyond, Jerry Epperson provided the basis for the section on building and invention. David E. Martin provided the ideas for Plant Control. The Turning Page and Polaris Comics gave us help with support materials, Chris Mortika supplied us with one of our favorite sections- and least-known super-heroes, Kate Novak, Roger Moore, Joe Karpierz, Dave Collins, Ed Sollers, Steve Winter, and Harold Johnson provided feedback in an incredibly short time. Margie Neville and Peter Sanderson of Marvel Comics Group provided review, comment, and official approval. Most of the Mighty Marvel bullpen fielded questions ranging from the mundane to the bizarre. Karen, Jeff, Dennis, Diesel, Colleen and Betty slaved away through the long hours to convert the original manuscript into a readable, presentable form <br/>And most important of all, thanks to those who have sent comments and questions, wrote long epistles, and button-holed me at conventions, who offered support and ideas and started me thinking on this project in the first place. A special thanks to you. This is the result of your effort and input as much as mine, The MARVEL SUPER HEROES Role-Playing Game is a growing entity, a game that should continue to grow as long as people are interested in telling the tales of their favorite heroes.<br/><br/>This is the next step in that growth.<br/><br/>-Jeff Grubb<br/>10 March, 1986<br/><br/>"}, "45411": {"rpgartist": ["Ghislain Barbe", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Fortier", "Pierre Ouellette", "Marc Ouellette"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "In the Shadow of CEGA", "rpgdesigner": ["Guy Francis Vella"], "rpgproducer": ["Wunji Lau", "David Paquin", "Marc A.

Likewise, it is also possible for the end of the bubble to never come in this game - and the same investments that can bring about your own downfall may very well make you a very rich person indeed.<br/><br/>The game takes place over four turns or quarters.  The game ends prematurely if three banks fail or the financial system fails.<br/><br/>This game is print and play and can be found at:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.jkntech.com/blog/page/Downturn-Board-Game.aspx' rel='nofollow'>http://www.jkntech.com/blog/page/Downturn-Board-Game.aspx</a><br/><br/>"}, "45452": {"rpgartist": ["John Hartwell", "Rowena"], "rpgitemversion": ["First printing", "PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "GURPS Aztecs", "rpgdesigner": ["Aurelio Locsin III"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic505099.jpg", "usersrated": "11", "average": "7.13636", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["GURPS (3rd Edition)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Steve Jackson Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)"], "rpggenre": ["History (Americas)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic505099_t.jpg", "description": "Sacrifice and Glory in a Lost Civilization<br/><br/>"}, "45453": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Jerry Lucas Spin Play Basketball", "playingtime": "24", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1964", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Basketball"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic504440_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic504440.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "24", "boardgamecategory": ["Sports"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "24", "description": "Jerry Lucas Spin Play has the thrills, fun, frustrations and anxiety of a real basketball game.

The Lone Orc Sighting Tower presents a detailed location you can easily insert in your own campaign.<br/><br/>An occasional daytime traveler passing near the Lone Orc Sighting Tower sees no more than a crumbling old sighting tower sitting on the top of an hill.<br/><br/>The tower appears burned, scarred and mostly destroyed, even if the two floors still stand up.<br/><br/>Exploring the ruin, during daytime, provides no significative experience since all that can be found are burned stones and rest of blackened furniture. If you are lucky enough you could find a secondary entrance to the dungeon of Garak the Unconquered.<br/><br/>During the night something wondrous happens. A ghostly one replaces the whole tower. Just before the ghostly tower&rsquo;s entrance a lone, ghostly orc, stands. Adventurers report that the orc halts everyone approaching the tower and shouts: &ldquo;What the secret of Garak the Unconquered is? Giving a right answer provides access for the ghostly tower.

On the left side of the path lies an old shepherd&rsquo;s house. The house is almost destroyed but the old cattle fence is still up and seems to protect a spectral herd. Within the fence you can still see the old well and a giant stump said to be the meeting place of dark druids cabals.<br/><br/>On the hilltop the mansion seems almost destroyed. Most of the building collapsed due to an obscure event in the past. Part of the mansion is still up, and even a section of the second floor is currently accessible via a creaky wooden staircase. A broken fence surrounds the whole hilltop. A huge dead tree, called the hangman Tree overlooks all, even the old windmill.<br/><br/>Within the fence you can find a well, a stable, a warehouse and a small burial ground.

A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.<br/><br/>Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.<br/><br/>&quot;The Ruined Town was destroyed long time ago by an evil warlord who defeated the Lord of the Town and sacked the whole country.<br/>Since the people were all killed or driven off, no one cared to reconstruct the town, which is now crumbling on itself. The Ruined Town has become a haunted and scaring place; old names were changed by local countrymen to reflect the spectral surroundings of the town. So, the Willow Cemetery become the Bones Hill Cemetery, the Hill of Sunray become the Hill of the Haunting Spectre and so on.<br/><br/>Furthermore, monsters made their lairs in the numerous dungeons and caverns of the town, at least where no undeads were discovered. Many evil beings, such as necromancers, black priests and the like, chose the town as their base of operations. Bandits settled in ruined castles of the town and smugglers use the crumbling docks of the town for loading/unloading smuggled goods.&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "45055": {"rpgdesigner": ["Andy Collins", "Gwendolyn F.
