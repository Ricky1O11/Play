As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. Players will need to assemble a crew, collect provisions and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. There is glory to be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie. So gather your warriors, it&rsquo;s raiding season!<br/><br/><br/>Aim of the Game<br/><br/>The aim of Raiders of the North Sea is to impress the Chieftain by having the most Victory Points (VP) at the game&rsquo;s end. Victory Points are gained primarily by raiding Settlements, taking Plunder and making Offerings to the Chieftain. How players use their Plunder is also vital to their success. The game ends when either only 1 Fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie are removed, or all Offerings have been made.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gameplay Overview<br/><br/>Proceeding clockwise from the starting player, each player takes his turn in full. On his turn, a player may choose to Work or Raid. Players continue to take turns until 1 of the 3 end-game conditions has been met. Regardless of choices, each turn follows the same pattern:<br/><br/>1. Place Worker and resolve its action<br/>2. Pick up a different Worker and resolve its action<br/><br/>Working<br/>Having a good Crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding. So before making any raids, players will need to do some work to prepare their Crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the Village, at the bottom of the board. There are 8 different buildings, with various actions. Players must first place their one and only Worker in an available building (where there is no Worker present), before picking up a different Worker from a different building (where there is a Worker present).<br/><br/>Raiding<br/>Once players have hired enough Crew and collected Provisions, they may choose to raid on their turn. To raid a Settlement (Harbour, Outpost, Monastery or Fortress), players need to meet 3 requirements. They must have:<br/><br/>1. A large enough Crew.<br/>2. Enough Provisions (and Gold for Monasteries/Fortresses).<br/>3. The required Worker colour.<br/><br/>Raiding offers various ways of scoring (Military Strength, Plunder, Valkyrie, etc.). This is also how Grey and White Workers enter the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>End of the Game<br/><br/>There are 3 ways the game can end:<br/><br/>1.

Polish player has access to three Ansaldos A-1 &bdquo;Balilla&rdquo; fighters trying to push back waves of Soviet cavalry. He uses special dice to attack soviet units and bombs that he can refill in three airbases. Every time the cavalry is hit the unit spreads and loses turn. Soviet player is the commander of 1st Cavalry Army, he uses ten cavalry units to reach his goal of taking Lvov and spreading the communism throughout Poland and then as the next step whole Europe. The cavalry has limited options of attacking aircraft although by using on movement he can defend during the attack and fire one shot at attacking Polish fighters, with a little bit of luck he can even destroy it. Polish Air Forces mission is to defend Lvov  by delaying the attacks of cavalry till the end of  18th August when the Soviet Army decides to withdraw and continue their attack towards Warsaw.

These theatres of operation are considered to be minor since they occurred far from the Emperor&rsquo;s view who was engaged in the north of France. Nevertheless, important and little-known battles took place there where the young Marie-Louise, the conscripts of the French army, displayed extraordinary courage. The first campaign, that of Marshal Augereau in France, recounts in three scenarios the march on the flanks of the Austrian army engaged against Napoleon.<br/><br/>In the first, the &ldquo;Lion of Castiglione&rdquo; must seize Geneva to cover his march on the enemy lines of communication. The second relates the Austrians&rsquo; offensive return from Dijon and the fall of Lyon after the battle of Limonest. The third covers the whole campaign from the beginnings of Augereau&rsquo;s timid offensive to the loss of the &ldquo;capital of the Gauls&rdquo;. The second campaign, led by Eug&egrave;ne de Beauharnais, describes the fierce combats for the supremacy of northern Italy. Threatened at his rear by the betrayal of Murat who is moving up from the south of the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; with his Neapolitans, Eug&egrave;ne withdrew from Verona to Mantua. The first scenario, very brief, simulates the about-turn of the French on the Mincio to counter the Austrian advance. The second covers the whole campaign from the evacuation of Verona to the victories of Eug&egrave;ne against various enemy threats.<br/><br/>With this new volume, The Marshals series evolves. The more imposing strengths of these campaigns required some adaptations that allowed for simulating the march of an entire army corps.

You&rsquo;ve used some tactics you&rsquo;re not proud of, but it&rsquo;s always gotten the job done. Now some of the other detectives are on a case that might reveal your dirty little secret. Can&rsquo;t let that happen, so better you expose their secret first. At least your partner has your back; seems it&rsquo;s hard to find someone you can rely on in this department.<br/><br/>Players will work with their partner to use deduction and rough tactics to uncover your opponents&rsquo; cards, while using misdirection to cover your own tracks. Players must gather evidence, information about opponents&rsquo; cards, and choose the right times to make accusations. Be careful about it, though, as every action you take has a trade-off, and often this gives your opponents knowledge to use against you. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Aim of the Game<br/><br/>You (and your partner) are trying to have the most Points at the end of the game. Points are gained by keeping your most valuable card secret until the end of the game, and using collected evidence to remove your opponents&rsquo; cards. During the game you&rsquo;ll use your chosen Action cards to gain information about opponents&rsquo; cards, and tactically position your cards to confound your opponents and open up new Actions for you to use. The game ends immediately after all the Evidence is collected.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Gameplay Overview<br/><br/>Each player has the same 8 Action cards. They are each numbered with the Time &ndash; 1 a.m. up to 8 a.m. This Time doubles as the card&rsquo;s value in points if it scores at the end of the game. Players will choose 5 cards to play with each game, keeping their choices secret. <br/>The game begins with a shared Evidence pool and every player with five face-down hidden cards: three forming a Front Line row and two making a Back Office row. In a 3- or 4-player game, there is also a Chief&rsquo;s Badge in the centre of play that is given to a player whenever they lose a card.<br/><br/>In turn, players take up to 2 unique actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Collect an Evidence<br/>     Accuse an opponent&rsquo;s card<br/>     Use a particular card from your Front Line (Players can use 2 different cards on their turn, just not the same one twice).<br/><br/><br/>Or they can spend BOTH actions to:<br/><br/>     Cover their tracks (rearrange 3 of their cards and flip them upside down again)<br/>     Claim the Chief&rsquo;s badge from another player, or use the Chief&rsquo;s badge as any card action (In 3- 4-player games).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Early in the game, players will primarily collect Evidence and use their Front Line cards to gain information. Later, they&rsquo;ll manipulate setups and try to use Evidence to eliminate cards from play. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Evidence<br/><br/>Collecting Evidence is crucial to victory, because you need it to make accusations. By itself, Evidence is worth 1 point for every 2 you have. But if you successfully use one to accuse an opponent, it goes into your Evidence Locker and is worth a full point. If you accuse incorrectly, however, the Evidence goes to your opponent.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>Accusations<br/>To win you&rsquo;ll need to reduce your opponents&rsquo; score by eliminating their high value cards. You can make random guesses, but that wastes both valuable Evidence and actions. Instead, you&rsquo;ll want to spend actions using your cards to get information first. Then just before they cover their tracks to remove what you know, you make an accusation. If you&rsquo;re right the Evidence doubles in value to a full point. But if you&rsquo;re wrong, it&rsquo;s lost to your opponent. Or worse, if you mis-accuse their Red Herring card, they get an additional Evidence from the pool.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Using a card<br/><br/>You can use any card that&rsquo;s still hidden in your Front line &ndash; but be careful! Don&rsquo;t point at it, flip it, or do anything that might indicate WHICH card you&rsquo;re using. Unless, that is, you&rsquo;re trying to mislead your opponent.<br/><br/>The low value/Time cards are powerful actions, as they will get you solid information like the Time difference between 2 cards of an opponent, or which cards in their Front line have &ldquo;finger-prints&rdquo; on them. This will help you deduce their cards, while other actions like the Frame-up, provide you with tactical moves to reposition some of your &ndash; or an opponent&rsquo;s &ndash; cards. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Bluffing?<br/><br/>In the basic game you are only able to take the actions of cards you legitimately have in your Front Line. This provides a more deduction and tactical game. However, optional bluffing rules allow players to take any action they wish &ndash; legal or not. But be careful that your opponent doesn&rsquo;t call you out that you&rsquo;re lying, or you&rsquo;ll start losing cards! <br/><br/><br/><br/>Covering your tracks<br/><br/>As your valuable cards and actions are revealed by opponents, or as they gain more information, you&rsquo;ll want to get a little breathing room. Covering your tracks may take your whole turn but it lets you choose 3 of your cards (Front line or in your reserved Back Office) to hide again and place wherever you like. It&rsquo;s a great way to get back in the game, or foil an opponent before they have the chance to accuse you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chief&rsquo;s badge<br/>The Chief would prefer that her detectives are focused on other criminal matters, and so in 3- and 4-player games, whenever a player loses a card to an accusation they receive the Chief&rsquo;s badge for protection. A player with the Chief&rsquo;s badge cannot be accused, and can use both their actions to activate the badge as any card &ndash; in play or not.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>End of the Game<br/><br/>Once the last Evidence token is claimed, the game ends. It&rsquo;s a timer, as once collected, Evidence never re-enters the central pool. <br/>Players score most of their points from the highest card they managed to keep hidden in their Front Line at the end of the game. Note that the Dirty Secret card is valued at 4 a.m., but if IT is the scoring card (highest one hidden), it scores an extra 7 points. The trick, of course, is making sure it&rsquo;s both hidden AND the highest Time in the front at game-end.<br/><br/>Each Players also score points for their collected Evidence<br/><br/><br/>     1 per 2 unused Evidence<br/>     1 per Evidence in locker (used to successfully accuse)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>Dirty Little Secrets is a game of &lsquo;playing the player&rsquo; as much as it is a game about your card-play. Good players are highly responsive to their opponents, and learn to push and prod player behaviours to their favour. With only 8 cards, it&rsquo;s not about having the right card &ndash; it&rsquo;s about knowing when and how to use it.<br/><br/>For rookies, there is a suggested set of cards to use that have more straight-forward actions that let these players be effective until they learn some of their own tricks and strategies.<br/><br/>"}, "170047": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2344836.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["Iron League Junior", "Iron League: Black Stadium"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez Arribas"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": ["Juegorama"], "maxplaytime": "90", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2344836_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Fantasy", "Fighting", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Sports", "Wargame"], "description": "Year 2100, world industry has focused on war machines called IRONS and countries compete to have the best Irons teams.

No Lookie's roots are in the line of games like Golf or Polish Poker but brings a variety of new mechanics that offer the modern gaming experience to a vintage, time-tested archetype.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to have the lowest score each round.  A hand consists of five cards dealt faced down to each player.  Without looking at the cards, players arrange their hand into two faced down rows in front of them:  a top row of two cards and a bottom row of three cards.  The rest of the deck is placed in the center of the table as a draw pile.  The top card is turned over and starts the discard pile.<br/><br/>Gameplay follows with draw-discard turns.  Players are allowed to look at the bottom-row cards prior to their first turn, but are not allowed to look at their cards again until the end of the round (except when discarding of course).  Various action cards may be discarded to trade, swap, or effect gameplay.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, the two rows score points and the player with the lowest score receives a victory point card.  For scoring: each card in the top row adds its numerical value to the player&rsquo;s score; if all three cards on the bottom row match numerically then all the cards in the bottom row score zero, but if all three cards do not match numerically then each card in the bottom row adds its numerical value to the player&rsquo;s score as they do on the top row.<br/><br/>1 deck plays up to 6 players<br/>2 decks play up to 12 players<br/><br/>73 Cards per deck:<br/><br/>    51 Number Cards<br/>    2 Wild Cards<br/>    13 Action Cards<br/>    7 Victory Point Cards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "8", "name": "No Lookie, No Peekie", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"]}, "170186": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Labyrinth Lord"], "statistics": [], "name": "By This Poleaxe", "rpgdesigner": ["Chris Kutalik"], "rpgproducer": ["Chris Kutalik"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2331862.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "5.5", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)", "War"], "rpgpublisher": ["Hydra Cooperative (Hydra Collective)"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2331862_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>By this Poleaxe is a four-page set of rules to allow a GM to run small-scale battles or skirmishes involving 15-120 combatants on each side without miniatures.

In Bushido, the fate of the world hangs not on armies but on individual heroes, men and women of extraordinary capacity, attuned to the all-permeating life force known as Ki. This force is the very fabric of the universe, and those with the appropriate training or natural talent can tap into this energy source and gain seemingly superhuman powers. In the world of Bushido, the delicate tapestry of Ki &ndash; and thus the universe itself &ndash;is threatened by the forces of imbalance, and it is up to you to protect it &ndash; or help rip it apart. In a game of Bushido, nothing less than the universe itself is at stake. Are you ready for the challenge of the Way of the Warrior?<br/><br/>There are currently six factions at war within the Jwar Isles:<br/><br/>The prefecture of Ryu<br/>The Dragon Clan won the rights to colonize the Westward Isles in a series of duels with their rivals, the Shiho Clan. However, when the Emperor's vessel expired, and his young heir, too young and inexperienced to concern himself with the petty disputes at the fringes of his lands, the promise of sole settlement rights died with him. The newly formed Prefecture of Ryu found themselves yet again in conflict with their old enemies, the Shiho Clan. Now, the Prefecture&rsquo;s grasp of power is weakened, due to the recent Tsunami. Their forces are in disarray, they are fighting on all fronts in the aftermath of the disaster. But still the men and women of the Dragon are ready to take their place at Destiny&rsquo;s table, uniting the human world by defending it against all threats.<br/><br/>The Temple of Ro-Kan<br/>The serene martial artist masters of the Ro-Kan have long viewed themselves as above all mortal and mundane conflicts. Now, following the Han civil war, the rise of the Cult of Yurei, and the incursion of the Savage Wave, the monks of Ro-Kan are being dragged into the clandestine wars of universal balance &ndash; a war in which they will reluctantly turn out to be key players. The monks follow an age-old path and know the secrets of Ki better than any others, but they are few and divided &ndash; will they be able to unite and join forces before it is too late?<br/><br/>The Savage Wave<br/>They take the form of evil creatures of myth and folklore. From where they come or why, no-one knows, but one thing is for certain, the wave crushes everything in its path. The Oni and Bakemono demon-creatures that make up the bulk of the Savage Wave appear bent on the destruction of humankind and all that is holy, but they are not mindless &ndash; as many opponents have found out at great pain, the Savage Wave is cunning and organized, and it operates according to its own weird and unknowable logic. Some mad hermits and outcast scholars whisper that this is not the first Savage Wave...<br/><br/>The Cult of Yurei<br/>In the shadows and dark corners of the world, the worshippers of Yurei are gathering force. The many members of this Cult may not even be aware that they are serving the same dark masters, but serve them they do &ndash; the Yurei Bargain, which in its various forms allows control over life and death, has proven a temptation to many different people who would otherwise have nothing in common. In the Cult of Yurei, you may think yourself the master of your own Fate but you are always advancing the unfathomable goals of dark unseen masters. Even a puppet master has someone pulling his strings...<br/><br/>The Ito<br/>The Ito have long been the laughing stock of the ruling clans. Never quite able to understand that it is their own flaws which hold their greater ambitions back. Being untrustworthy is synonymous with the Ito in the Jwar Isles; their support of the Shiho&rsquo;s rise to power followed by their treacherous role in the Dragon Wars against the very same clan, highlights their fickle nature. Now though the Ito on the island of Izu have gone through a transformation, their alliance with an age old and powerful Kami has imbued them with a new found strength. If it was the Kami that caused the snake like changes or whether it has simply exaggerated the Ito&rsquo;s natural affinity is unknown. What is sure is that the Ito finally have the power to rise against the other clans and avenge the mockery and mistreatment they have suffered. Will this venomous clan prove to be one dose of poison too much for the Jwar Isles?<br/><br/>Silvermoon Trade Syndicate<br/>The thriving port of Jima is the beating heart of the Silvermoon Trade Syndicate&rsquo;s operations. For generations the merchants of the syndicate have been the trade life blood of the Jwar isles. From the great gambling halls, where fortunes are won or lost, on the roll of a single dice or the draw of a card. A bustling and bountiful harbour brimming with exotic goods and rare delights. Famed arenas where colossal Jumo warriors clash in a brutal dance, or an array of fighting beasts struggle in a battle to the death. Water houses where ones wildest fantasies can become reality with the touch of a Rose. Their power lies not the in military might of the Ito, Takashi or Minimoto but in the stranglehold they have on trade. And not only the trade of goods, but of the secrets and whispers of even the most pious. Some would liken the Silvermoon to the flip of a coin. Pay your debts and you come up in the sun with the fortunes smiling, cross or try to cheat them and you&rsquo;ll be in the dark and covered in dirt.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English second edition"], "name": "Bushido (Second edition)", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Simulation", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["219087", "219764", "223563", "219528", "221506", "221510", "219729", "212725", "219732", "219258", "219738", "225110", "223566", "219742", "218941", "225101", "219727", "221505", "219761", "219736", "225108", "219439", "219202", "221514", "219763", "212727", "213231", "219735", "225104", "219530", "218936", "219749", "219252", "221515", "218945", "219207", "221501", "219536", "219084", "219201", "218944", "219537", "219531", "221507", "219745", "219529", "219533", "219203", "219731", "219730", "219254", "219204", "219733", "225107", "223562", "225115", "219532", "212724", "225102", "219093", "218937", "219740", "212726", "219440", "225103", "219091", "218940", "221497", "213229", "219436", "219435", "223565", "221508", "221509", "221512", "221504", "183964", "219734", "213230", "219438", "218946", "219607", "225111", "225106", "219728", "218938", "219535"], "usersrated": "5", "boardgameaccessory": ["Bushido: Kage Kaze Zoku Faction Dice", "Bushido: Special Attack & Defence Cards", "Bushido: Temple of Ro-kan Faction Dice"], "average": "6.8"}, "170202": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2337868.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ben Pinchback", "Matt Riddle"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["John Ariosa"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2337868_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice"], "description": "Ama is tired.

For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.<br/><br/>Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages).

They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.<br/><br/>Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed.

While the bubbles glow the player can collect their points by simply bursting by touching them. This mechanic involves a lot of tactic, the player can spare bubbles to merge them later and increase the worth of them this way.

Other bubbles that he can collide with become obstacles and he need to push around the obstacle or first push that obstacle out of the way. While doing that a careful approach is required because too fast movements can result that a bubble gets hit into a edge of the playing field which results that the bubbles gets freezed for 10 seconds.

As of July 2013, Club Penguin has over 200 million registered user accounts.<br/><br/>While free memberships are available, revenue is predominantly raised through paid memberships which allow players to access a range of additional features, such as the ability to purchase virtual clothing, furniture, and in-game pets called 'puffles' for their penguins through the use of in-game currency.<br/><br/>The game is specifically designed for children aged 6 to 14, however, users of any age are allowed to play Club Penguin. Thus a major focus of the developers has been on child safety, with a number of features introduced to the game to facilitate this &mdash; including offering an 'Ultimate Safe Chat' mode, whereby users select their comments from a menu; filtering that prevents swearing and the revelation of personal information; and moderators who patrol the game.

Instead of ladders, players pull out cards that may help or hinder their progress. &ldquo;Pu wins the Nobel Peace Prize&rdquo; sets the player one step back, while &ldquo;Kazakhstan is prevented from joining Russia&rsquo;s side&rdquo; lets them get one ahead.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The idea of the game was born during the events of last spring in Ukraine,&rdquo; Taavi Emajoe told the Russian-language Delfi website in Estonia. &ldquo;We hope people find the game humorous.

Most of the ideas in the game are derived directly from his persona.&rdquo;<br/><br/>After easily passing the &euro;1,500 (US$1,734) funding requirement on the local version of Kickstarter, the game has now hit the shelves, retailing at &euro;23.45 ($27).<br/><br/>The manager of Tallinn&rsquo;s leading Apollo bookshop, Liis Paas, told Delfi that the game has been &ldquo;attracting a heightened level of attention&rdquo; from curious shoppers. However, the manager did not elaborate whether interest had transformed into sales.<br/><br/>Estonia is historically sensitive about being invaded by the Soviet Union in 1940, following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and local politicians still frequently evoke the specter of a Russian invasion, despite the country being a member of NATO and the EU.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, satirical board games about Putin &ndash; often based on Snakes and Ladders &ndash; have previously appeared in Russian and Western media following a whirlwind year for the Kremlin, mostly as playful illustrations, not actual games to be played with pieces and dice.<br/><br/>Satirical board games have enjoyed a mixed history, with acclaim depending largely on the players&rsquo; political orientation. The US board game War on Terror &ndash; which satirizes US foreign policy and forces players to temporarily don balaclavas as they face American wrath &ndash; is still popular, while the pre-WWII Juden Raus, in which German players had to &ldquo;round up Jews&rdquo; and &ldquo;push them off the board&rdquo; enjoys a different sort of notoriety.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Estonian first edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Seltsimees Puu Eestit vallutamas", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "average": "4.66667", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Estonia"]}, "170258": {"rpgartist": ["Jacob Blackmon", "James Hazelett", "Jonathan Roberts"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Secrets of the Divine: Adventure, Earth, Magic, & Water", "rpgdesigner": ["Steven D.

The Cypher Chest brings them all together in a single print product that gives you all three decks plus a great way to store them! The three decks come in a sturdy rigid box, sized to sit neatly alongside your Numenera books on your RPG shelves. The internal tray holds the three existing decks, with room to store future expansions. Cyphers are among the most common type of numenera devices in the Ninth World. Usually single-use and frequently cobbled together or used in ways completely unrelated to their original intent, cyphers are a great opportunity for characters to discover and use the numenera as one-time weapons, wearable devices, quick heals, and more. The Cypher Deck allows GMs and players to randomly generate single-use cyphers on the fly. Twenty item cards are lavishly illustrated with different device types, while each of the 100 power cards offers multiple power options to match the device. Exploration and risk are everything in Numenera. Players earn experience points not for killing monsters, but for making discoveries and facing unexpected challenges. You might rack up your XP between sessions, but most commonly you receive experience points during play, when events take an unexpected turn or you make a remarkable discovery. And XPs are a sort of currency, often changing hands between players. The XP Deck provides a set of tangible tokens to represent experience points. Build encounters quickly and easily, or create them randomly on the fly - then give your players a look at their foes before plunging into combat. The Creature Deck contains 100 of the most commonly encountered creatures in the Ninth World, drawn from both the Numenera core book and The Ninth World Bestiary. When you need to build an encounter (either when prepping your game or at the gaming table), simply draw a card from this deck.

Many of the remote schools were destroyed during the conflict, the great secrets they held thought lost forever. Recently one establishment has been rediscovered, one which the Convocation would like explored and looted. For five centuries the school has lain untouched by the outside world, but it has not been completely ignored. Something lurks in the heart of the ancient school, something powerful, something which hungers....and it is not alone! Are the adventurers destined to survive their foray into the lost school of magic, or will they struggle to survive Against the Elements? A strange shadow has fallen over the normally quiet village of Rushton. The villagers have been acting strangely, with some disappearing for days at a time and a few families missing entirely! Behind these strange occurrences is an unearthly creature, part-human and part-spider. This creatures venom enslaves the weak minded and the it plans to enslave the whole of Rushton and beyond! Can the heroes defeat this malevolent evil? In Web of Deceit the heroes will be fully tested in this exciting adventure for Hellfrost! The village of Drayton is beset by plague. Seemingly abandoned by their healer, the villagers now turn to strangers for help. But there is more to the illness than appears, for the hand of the Norns is at work.

The call to arms has been issued, but are you ready to engage in the Clash of Steel? The Restless Dead contains four Mass Battles scenarios. Although designed as standalone events, the GM can easily work them into an existing campaign. Also included is an alternate set of rules for running very large-scale battles on the tabletop. Now the players can literally control the actions of their troops and watch the battle unfold before their eyes. More importantly, it allows characters to use many of their regular Edges and still play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the encounter.<br/><br/>"}, "170270": {"rpgartist": ["David G.

Most commercially available sets of rules require several hours to set up and play to a conclusion; some can easily swallow up a whole day or weekend. For many gamers this means that their lavishly prepared miniature armies rarely get used at all. Apart from time, the other consideration is space, which further constrains the opportunities for a game. In One-hour Wargames, veteran gamer and rule-writer Neil Thomas has addressed both these problems. Now it is practical to play a game in around an hour on a normal dining table or living room floor. \u2028\u2028The book contains 8 (all-new) sets of very simple rules for various periods, from Ancient to WW2 and 30 scenarios which can be played using any of them, so you don't even have to take too much time thinking up a stimulating tactical situation and objectives. All the rules and scenarios are intended to be played on a 3ft x 3ft battlefield. The rules only require a small number of miniatures, so this really is an ideal way for new gamers, or veterans trying a new period, to get started with minimal investment of time and money. Also ideal for a quick game in the evening when a friend pops round. There are also sections on campaigns and solo games.<br/><br/>"}, "170299": {"poll": [], "name": "Psycho!Therapist", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "3", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2370649_t.png", "average": "4", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2370649.png", "boardgameversion": ["(Upcoming) First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Party Game"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "A humorous party game for 3-8 players. Players take on the role of a Psycho!Therapist and attempt to treat people with problems ranging from weird to WTF?!<br/><br/>This game is like something out of Whose Line Is It Anyway, and Machine of Death.<br/><br/>Components<br/>Cards: There are a variety of cards in Psycho!Therapist. Each is described below:<br/>TYPE Cards: These cards have adjectives that describe the way the client presents themselves, such as Angry, Friendly, Groggy, etc. <br/>CLIENT Cards: These cards typically identify your client&rsquo;s occupation, such as Doctor, Lawyer, Ice Cream Truck Driver, etc.  <br/>PROBLEM Cards: These cards provide a description of the kind of problem the client has, such as a phobia, being on probation, or medical illness that is related to the behavior. <br/>BEHAVIOR Cards: These cards describe the specific action the person is taking that is deviant, dangerous, dysfunctional, or causes distress such as: Giving play by play commentary on other people&rsquo;s behavior, doing inappropriate things on the copy machine, or poking an eye out (Mama told you it would happen!)<br/>TOOL Cards: These cards list objects, some very specific (a 10 foot pole) and others up the players imagination (something that begins with the letter B) that the player uses to enhance their chances of a successful treatment. These also contain a modifier (+5, +10+) which is added to their dice roll to determine success or failure. <br/>DICE: The dice included in the set are called Percentile Dice. There is a tens dice and a ones dice. The scores range from 01 to 100 (a roll of 00,0). Thus a roll of 40 on the tens dice and 7 on the ones dice equals a result of 47%. <br/>MODIFIER Cards: these are double sided, with +10 (in green) on one side and -10 (in red) on the other. These are used when players either make exceptionally good rolls (critical success) or exceptionally bad rolls (critical failures).They only last until they are played on their next turn.  <br/>GAMEBOARD and PLAY MATS<br/>The Mats are included to help you keep score in terms of Therapeutic Successes, Therapeutic Failures, and to keep track of the Tools you use.<br/><br/>The Base Mechanic: Players will come up with imaginative treatments for the clients described in the game. Patients are made up of a Type, Client, Problem, and Behavior. So when creating a random patient for the game, you draw one of each card and place them together (Game mode determines if they are laid out in the center of the board, or stacked with only the TYPE card on top face up). <br/>All patients have a Base Chance of Success of 50% to start (though this can decrease if a Player fails in their attempt at Psycho!Therapy). Players then describe their treatment plan with the patient in an attempt to cure them. Using the Tools adds to the chance of the Players success. Players will rarely have more than 3 Tools, but the bonuses are cumulative. Whenever Tools are used, they modify the Base Chance of Success (hence, a player using all three tools that have +5 modifiers now has a 65% chance of success). <br/>Once the treatment plans have been described (and in some modes the Clinical decides which player&rsquo;s treatment plan sounds best), the modifiers from the Tools are added together, the player rolls the dice and tries to get the target number or below in order to have a therapeutic success. <br/>So if Player 1 had used all three tools and gained a +15, they would need to roll 65 or less on the percentile dice (50% Base Chance + 15 from the Tools = 65% chance of success).<br/><br/>A Role-playing Suggestion:<br/><br/>    Completely Optional but very fun: Instead of just drawing the cards and focusing on the solution, the game can be a lot more fun when other players decide to improvise things the client might say or do. Remember that they will generally be compliant with the therapist and the use of tools (refer to the Type cards &ndash; hence, in the case of a Belligerent Client, the therapist might just have to make them use the tools despite their stubbornness, a Shy client might have to be coaxed or encouraged to use them). This opens the window to some really funny one-liners and statements!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>  Also, don&rsquo;t be afraid to invent other objects that help place the Tools in context. You can certainly use other things besides your tools, they just don&rsquo;t add to your chances of Therapeutic Success (see the example in the next column where Mark used an emergency air mask). <br/>When Tools are generic, such as &ldquo;a flask containing a liquid&rdquo;, you get to choose all the details!.<br/> To help with the characterization of the patient, think of any stereotypes about the Client first. Then, think of what would be frustrating to them about their job. What would they complain about? This is a good way to get a funny initial feel for the Client. You can even name them if you want!<br/><br/>Winning And Losing The Game<br/>See the different modes for specific win/lose conditions. In general, the game continues until a Psycho!Therapist reaches 4 Therapeutic Successes, or there are no more clients to treat (either all in jail or have become Serial Killers). <br/>Alternate Rule #2 (for Court Ordered or Dark Mode): If having no winner bothers you, the person with the most Therapeutic Successes when the game stops is considered the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "170300": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2337331.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Matt Wolfe"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Mateusz Szulik"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2337331_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Humor"], "description": "Did you know that wombats poop cubes?

The great news is that as the turn sequence in Chain of Command is not reliant on drawing chits, cards or dice, the system doesn&rsquo;t slow down with multiple players and the core rules remain exactly the same throughout, so no great learning curve to embark on with Big Chain of Command!<br/><br/>To make things easy, we have added a number of pages to show how the various nations organised their armoured platoons so that you can follow historical precedent or just form an ad hoc &ldquo;kampfgruppe&rdquo; from the vehicles in your collection. However you enjoy your games, you&rsquo;ll find that Big Chain of Command allows you to play these great rules in a more sociable big game atmosphere.

We should have nothing to fear hidden in this plateau until we are ready to defend this location from their ground and air assaults.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Hidden Village is a single exterior large-scale map of a village of huts hidden in a plateau in the mountains. To further hide the village, the huts have been dyed grey to appear as simple rock outcroppings when viewed from above. The scale of the map is 15-20 feet per inch/hex/square.<br/><br/>Hidden Village is intended for use in primordial, fantasy, historical, and modern games. This map could also be useful as a village on a primitive world in a science fiction game. Whether the war is fought with sticks and stones, swords and plowshares, rifles and bombers, or AK-47s and helicopters, this is sure to be a battlefield useful across many time periods.<br/><br/>The Japanese have been fortifying the hidden village on a plateau of an island, preparing for an Allied attack as they leapfrog towards Japan. The island is in a strategic position that the Japanese believe must be taken by the Americans in order to reach the Japanese mainland. The village appears normal during the day, with plain-clothed Japanese soldiers pretending to be villagers and running inside the huts in case of the spotting of an Allied plane. The Japanese are moving up material to the village at night, positioning flak cannons and machine gun nests in caves and even in the houses themselves. When the defenses are ready, it will be a death trap for American planes and any infantry trying to take the plateau.<br/><br/>For this scenario, one player plays the Japanese defenders and one player plays the American attackers. The Japanese have access to mostly defensive weapons such as machine guns and flak guns. The flak guns can be turned towards the ground to act as anti-tank guns but the Japanese commanders believe the plateau to be unreachable by tanks and other heavily tracked vehicles. The Japanese have access to a field engineer that can create a cave at any mountainous location on the battlefield to make a machine gun nest in an important position.<br/><br/>The Americans have access to plenty of offensive weapons such as B17 flying fortress bombers and paratroopers. They should also have an American engineer crew that has created a tunnel into the plateau with explosives. The American commander chooses where this is deployed and is his main route for infantry into this scenario besides paratroops. The Japanese win by successfully defending against the American offensive whereas the Americans win by wiping out the Japanese defenses and taking the plateau. Double the point value for any type of ground vehicle in this scenario as it takes a ton of resources to get it up the plateau for either side.<br/><br/>"}, "170355": {"rpgdesigner": ["Aaron Bailey"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "So What's The Human Called, Anyway?

What&rsquo;s worse is that the supernatural could be hidden in any disguise a friend, a brother, a son. The community leaders would do just about anything to keep the seed of heresy from spreading in their communities. This incidentally, is where our &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; come in.<br/><br/>Players are normal townspeople who have been given magical powers and abilities from a Mystical Benefactor. They have been given one objective in return for their newfound power: Chaos.<br/><br/>They must take care however, if they are caught there are dire consequences for stepping outsided of society&rsquo;s boundries. Even if they manage to evade the notice of the authorities, the community will react in greater force to the strange happenings, the inexplicable bad fortune that seems to have befallen the town and the disappearances. Can our troublemakers complete their mission of disrupting a community or will they be rooted out by the powers that be? Will they become the hunters or... The Hunted?<br/><br/>The Game:<br/><br/>Mystical Benefactors<br/>There are currently 8 Mystical Benefactors to choose from for a given campaign. Each has their own special abilities and unique spells when they are active. This makes The Hunted have great replayability.<br/><br/>Avoid Suspicion<br/>Players attempt to complete the objective, take down all three Authority Figures, while pretending to live a normal life. Players must pay taxes (10 Coins every Tuesday) and generally just stay out of trouble whilst carrying out their hazardous misdeeds.<br/><br/>Chaos<br/>To grow stronger, players must commit disruptive acts upon the community to earn Chaos Points. Chaos Points are used to purchase Spells and Familiars (Animals bound to you by the Dark Benefactor that will obey your every order.) Chaos Points can be earned by:<br/><br/>Destroying property Converting villagers to join your cult Sacrificing Animals and villagers Taking down Authority Figures And other generally blasphemous thingsPlayers can work together or separately to gain Chaos Points. However, at the end of one week, the player who has earned the most Chaos points is rewarded greatly by the Dark Benefactor, while the player who earns the least is punished. This adds an element of competitiveness to the general cooperative spirit of the game.<br/><br/>Paranoia<br/>Should a character be noticed doing something strange, they will gain Paranoia Points. Paranoia Points indicate how suspicious the villagers are of that player being a heretic. Players will have increasingly harsh sanctions set against them as their paranoia score rises, such as the townspeople watching them more closely or their house being searched for heretical paraphernalia, eventually ending in their execution for heresy. Players can reduce Paranoia by doing things that are expected of them, like going to church or being a nice person, these things usually come at the cost of Chaos Points, bringing a delicate balance of Paranoia and Chaos that players must manage. Typically, it is best to be able to not be noticed or to be able to talk your way out of a dicey situation.<br/><br/>Even if players do manage not to be noticed, villagers will begin to notice the unexplained happenings, the disappearances, and the downright spooky things that seem to be happening around them lately. The village itself has a Paranoia score that raises when something cannot be explained or something clearly supernatural happens. When this score rises, the Authority Figures become increasingly frantic to find and kill the heretics among them. Lowering the Town Paranoia can be difficult, so players must take care with their actions. If the Town Paranoia is too high, for too long, the village will be purged by the Church and the players lose the game.<br/><br/>"}, "170357": {"rpgdesigner": ["Greg Stafford", "Scott R.

This particular release is Set 1, and deals with the German, Russian, and Finland forces of the Eastern Front.<br/><br/>FOV is a set of modules that extend the use of any counter based war game so that you can add both the often under-utilized practice of &ldquo;Fog of War&rdquo; OR that of higher level Intelligence Gathering and Logistics to virtually any simulation game.  The game tool is also used to represent hidden assets such as Ammunition Supply, Fuel, and other factors common to any higher level logistic advantages gained via logistical planning.  It is in fact this &quot;Level Over&quot; that FOV uses to bring new strategies and tactics to most war games without changing the underlying game rules. The level of  added realism this tool set provides is rarely found in conjunction with any other current game publication.<br/><br/>What the Flags of Valour systems all do is give players of wargames a way to remove most of your counters from the board at the start of any game, and replace them with national hidden placement counters.  Meantime you have a hidden area where normal game counters are kept on LUC (Logistical Unit Cards) until enemy recon or proximity force the regular unit pieces to be placed on the board and revealed.  This allows war games to start with a form of hidden movement and place that is traditionally thought of as &ldquo;double blind&rdquo; play.  Except in this case you can do the double-blind with only one central board (unlike the awkward and messy way that most double blind games take up a lot of room and require two copies of a board or a game).<br/><br/>Depending on the particular FOV release, some provide for additional hidden rules such as Strongpoints, Air Strikes, Guerilla activity, Supply Lines, and more. Add on rules are completely optional, and are left to the discretionary use of the players using the system.<br/><br/>Each FOV release comes with 2-6 nation state counters.  There are releases for many different eras available, but primarily the counter sets cover WW2 and Modern use.  There are also the &ldquo;125&rdquo; series of FOV releases for use with Miniatures games. Those use larger placement counters and much larger LUC (Logistical Unit Cards) on which to place miniatures hidden off the board.<br/><br/>"}, "170383": {"rpgdesigner": ["John Reiher"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "The Brass Monkey Ball", "rpgartist": ["John Reiher"], "rpgproducer": ["Melody Natcher", "John Reiher"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2339997.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Fiasco"], "rpgpublisher": ["Tri Tac Systems"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure", "Action / Adventure (Pulp)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2339997_t.jpg", "description": "publisher blurb<br/><br/>Want to dip your toes into the Hardwired Hinterland?

With two armies of equal strength, victory requires careful planning, precise maneuvers, and exact timing to take advantage of the opportunities offered by unexpected events.

I know that, to some, this might be bad: personally, I hate randomly generated defects (the 3d6 ability score rolls are quite punishing by themselves), and I felt like 50 mutations would be a good number. Also, this system is a bit more flexible than 7th edition's origins (which I like, by the way).<br/>    Gamma Wanderer class: In Gamma Five, PCs all share the same class. The Gamma Wanderer class goes up to level 10 only, but climbs up quicker than D&amp;D Basic classes when it comes to features (e.g. 2 extra attack features by level 9). It also grants proficiency in all weapons and armors, plus a d12 Hit Die and four skill proficiencies of the player's choice. While clearly unbalanced in a D&amp;D Basic game, those benefits become a must when facing Gamma Five monsters, which are a bit tougher than their Challenge Rating might suggest.<br/>    Skills: Gamma Five leaves out some skills (Arcana, Religion...) and introduces new ones (Ancient Tech, Conspiracy, Science).<br/>    Equipment: The obligatory gear section. In Gamma Five, weapons and armor are handled in an abstract way. You simply choose a type of weapon (Light Melee, Heavy Melee, Light Ranged, Heavy Ranged, Light Ranged Gun, Heavy Ranged Gun) and a type of armor (Light, Medium, Heavy, Shield), write down its fixed stats, then you decide what it looks like.

It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume XIII, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.<br/><br/>This installment includes 22 mythic spells, from longstrider to message. A mythic mage&rsquo;s lucubration gets you two spells for the price of one, and even allows you to regain any spell you know, instead of one that was prepared and expended. Live in luxury in a mythic mage&rsquo;s magnificent mansion, which is not only larger and longer lasting, but comes with more competent servants, and can be made visible, allowing you to set up shop in style. Among other improvements, a mythic magic circle against chaos allows you to trap any chaotic outsider in the circle, instead of just summoned ones, and a mythic magic jar takes all the guesswork out of picking a target, while also safeguarding you against the dangers of your host dying.

Andr&aacute;s is likely to be a victim of poisoning and the real power is in the hands of the most powerful barons, who rule as kings in their own realm. Waging war against each other, the country is essentially torn into several parts. Everyone is preparing for the final showdown... and the war has begun!<br/><br/>The country is divided into six provinces, each ruled by a different baron and all they want is the crown.

Diplomacy has a very important role, from the money you gather you have to bid on the offices of the Palatine, the Judge and the Treasurer. The game is immediately won, if someone manages to acquire all three offices, or the barons of the other players are defeated and killed in battle, or specified castles are occupied or rules 3-4 separate parts of the country.
