The players are wanderers; drivers of cars that have been modified to help them endure the perils &ldquo;out there&rdquo; as they travel the highways between fortified villages and settlements.<br/><br/>The game can be played by one or more players. Ideally, the game is intended to be played by &ldquo;more&rdquo; players but works fine as a solo game. In a multi-player game, the individuals can work together, or against each, or as teams if they have enough players.<br/><br/>The basic component is a standard deck of 52 cards, a token to show the drivers movement across the cards, and two 1d6 to keep track of the drivers two stats: health/speed.<br/><br/>Each player is trying to get his driver across a wasteland of broken roads, and marauding bandits.  The cards themselves are used as the road, modifiers during movement, and combat against marauders or other players.<br/><br/>The card suite and face value will determine the type and strength of encounters the driver will face along the road,  The driver will in turn use their hand of cards to control the speed of their vehicle as well as the strength of their attack and defense.   During a co-op game, the drivers can use their cards to help friendly drivers fight off marauders or control their driving reactions.<br/><br/><br/>The game was designed as part of the Traditional Card Game design contest.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/421774/page/1' rel='nofollow'>http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/421774/page/1</a><br/><br/>"}, "54047": {"rpgitemversion": {"9803": "Dragonlance 3.5 DMScreen"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Dragonlance Dungeon Master's Screen", "rpgproducer": {"1038": "Larry Elmore"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic777054.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "5.5", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"524": "d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic777054_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>The Dragonlance Campaign Sourcebook introduced unique elements to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, such as the effects of the waxing and waning moons of magic upon Krynn's wizards.

Massive man-eating beasts roam the unexplored regions of Lemuria and beyond, from islet-sized sea serpents capable of sinking war-galleys to the huge jungle-dwelling dinosaurs that can swallow a man whole merely as an appetizer for bigger game.<br/><br/>The sword &amp; sorcery genre is a very specific one - characters are much more stereotypical than in other fantasy settings - heroes are all muscle-bound barbarians from the &ldquo;Frozen Wastes&rdquo;, mighty gladiators who fight for the thrill of the crowds or bawdy pirates with an eye for treasure and a yearning for adventure.  Women are voluptuous scantily clad beauties to be rescued from evil priests or lithe adventurers as capable in a fight as most ordinary men and just as ready to crack a barbarian&rsquo;s skull as bed him if spoken to lewdly. The bad guys are invariably evil necromancers, sorcerers, priests and druids. Sometimes they are lily-livered nobles or cunning assassins, but even they often have a magician behind their nefarious plots.<br/><br/>The main characters are never out to save the world from the minions of evil, they simply look out for themselves although this usually means in their own simple way they &lsquo;do the right thing&rsquo; in the end in any event. They are not heartless; they tend to stand up for those weaker than themselves and put down those who push others around. They are never inherently evil - that is the role of the villains or NPCs.<br/><br/>Heroes are first and foremost warriors and when times are hard will seek employment as soldiers, mercenaries, sailors or caravan guards to get by, often rising rapidly to higher positions as a result of their prowess. When nothing else is available they will often turn their hands to other, less honest, work. They will often be found turning to a life of thievery or piracy to make a few coins ...<br/><br/>"}, "54108": {"rpgitemversion": {"9856": "Draft"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "White Mountain, Black River", "rpgproducer": {"11339": "Lowell Francis"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1224998.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "7.5", "rpggenre": {"278": "Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)"}, "rpg": {"9549": "White Mountain, Black River"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1224998_t.jpg", "description": "From the designer:<br/>Our homebrew rpg rules for handling a fantasy wuxia based game.

Hopefully. For the players? Probably not.<br/><br/>But yes, unlike some story-telling and roleplaying games, Misery Bubblegum focusses on romance, relationships, uncertainty and humor. There aren't any special rules for combat, car chases, daring escapes and grievous injuries. It's all just stuff you do while trying to impress the girl. If you want a little martial arts to spice up your romance story then Misery Bubblegum has you covered. If you want a little romance to spice up your martial arts story then there are other systems out there that do that better.<br/><br/>Why is it cool?<br/><br/>If you've already got plenty of games ideal for the sweet teen romance genre, what makes Misery Bubblegum stand out? It fits in your pocket and it fits in your life. You can run the game with nothing but the deck of cards ... no pencils, no paper, no markers, no dice.

Program it.<br/>Your body is a shell. Change it.<br/>Death is a disease. Cure it.<br/>Extinction is approaching. Fight it.&quot;<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>The Game<br/>Humanity stands on the cusp of a new age, with accelerated technological growth converging toward a singularity point, promising an undreamt-of future. Despite the ecopocalypse and social upheavals on Earth, humanity has conquered the solar system and partially terraformed Mars. Advancements in biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science have transformed our lives. Everyone is wirelessly networked with the world around them, AIs process vast amounts of information, and nano-fabrication enables people to &quot;print&quot; complex devices from the molecular level - at home. Biotechnology allows people to genefix, enhance, and clone their bodies, while others pursue body modifications to adapt to new environments or make themselves into something no longer quite human. People&rsquo;s minds and memories can be digitized, uploaded, transferred over long distances, and downloaded into new bodies (biological or synthetic). Death has been defeated - for those who can afford it.<br/><br/>From within, disaster struck. Transhumanity reaped the rewards of its arrogance when conflict spiked between the battered nations of Earth, already weakened by decades of climate catastrophes and other disruptive factors. Rampant netwars soon exploded into physical conflicts with spiraling body counts. In the midst of these aggressions, a group of military AIs known as TITANS quietly achieved full sentience and autonomy, and rapidly began exponentially incrementing their own intellectual growth. The AI intelligences spawned by this hard-takeoff singularity quickly turned against transhumanity, enveloping the system in unprecedented levels of violence, disaster, and warfare. What began as a whirlwind of conflict between political factions, revolutionaries, and hypercorps soon escalated into a struggle between man and machine.<br/><br/>In just a few years, transhumanity was nearly wiped out with nuclear strikes, biowarfare plagues, destructive nanoswarms, infowar attacks, mass uploads, and other unexplained singularity events, ripping the superpowers of old to pieces. Our planetary home &quot;Earth&quot; was transformed into a toxic and strange hellhole, while many major habitats were left frozen sarcophagi in the vacuum of space. Just as quickly as they came, the TITANS disappeared, taking millions of uploaded minds with them, leaving behind a network of wormhole gateways. Known as Pandora Gates, these poorly-understood devices allow instantaneous teleportation to distant star systems - often one-way and/or fatal. Though only a handful of Pandora Gates are known to exist - each highly contested - the foolish, brave, curious, and desperate are already risking certain death to enter and explore what lies beyond.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of the Fall, transhumanity lives on, divided into a patchwork of hypercorp combines, survivalist stations, transhuman faction species, and city-state habitats. Under the oppressive police states of immortal inner-system oligarchies, advanced technologies remain highly restricted, and refugee infomorphs are held in virtual slavery or resleeved in robotic bodies and forced into indentured labor. In the outer system, rebel transhuman scientists and techno-anarchists struggle to maintain a new society - from each according to their imagination and to each according to their need. And on the fringes and in the niches lurk networked tribes of political extremists, religious fanatics, criminal entrepeneurs, and bizarre posthumans, among other, stranger, and more alien things ...<br/><br/>Though most claim the Fall was carefully orchestrated by the out-of-control TITANS, others whisper that the driving powers behind the wars - both AI and transhuman - were infected by a mutating virus with multiple infection vectors - biological, information, nano - dubbed the Exsurgent virus. Whatever its source, this virus has been known to sometimes transform its victims into something unexplainable ... something monstrous and reality-altering. Whatever the truth, the remnants of the TITANS and this virus were left to the desolated ruins or driven to the edges of the system, where they remain hidden away in dark corners, quietly waiting to infect the minds of the scavengers and explorers who find them ...<br/><br/>System<br/>Eclipse Phase uses a variant d100/percentile system with some twists. The game is fast and simple, streamlined so players can dive into the world and action without being burdened down by complex rules.<br/><br/>"}, "54246": {"rpgitemversion": {"9996": "PDF version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "vs. Monsters Anthology", "rpgproducer": {"844": "Philip Reed"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907272.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": {"158": "Horror"}, "rpg": {"1543": "vs. Monsters"}, "rpgcategory": {"2130": "Alternate Rules (Variant Core Rules)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic907272_t.jpg", "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>What happens when you give six game authors freedom to write whatever they want for vs. Monsters?

Imagine roleplaying in the setting of favorite humorous fantasy film or novel (e.g., Shrek, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Princess Bride, etc.); Murphy's World is design to encompass all of these and more. It is the Realm of Faerie, the Land of Myths and Legends, the place of popular folklore and dreams (with a dash of pop culture) - comically twisted, yet maintaining an internal sense of logic. What makes it most unusual it that it operates according to Murphy's Laws -'If something can go wrong, it will.'<br/><br/>The real culprit is the planet's sun, Ludo. The chaotic energies with which this amber orb assaults the little planet effectively toss any sense of predictability of natural laws or supernatural forces right out the metaphysical window. Even magic is possible on Murphy's World, but the results can be somewhat... unpredictable.<br/><br/>Murphy's World also happens to be in possession of an extensive but faulty network of interdimensional Teleportation Gates, connecting Murphy's World to just about everywhere.

At the end of each round, gain  points for cards in your mountain and delta.<br/><br/>The basic rules introduce the four player actions: Weathering,  Hillslope, Fluvial, and Draw Cards. The advanced rules add details: atmospheric change, ice  ages, glaciers, flood volcanism, quakes, etc.<br/><br/>Mountains are far more dynamic than the limitations of human  lifetimes would suggest. Their growth and death involve cycles that keep the planet habitable. The machinery of these cycles is called erosion: the weathering of rock and its transport to the sea. Once there, it is subducted into the mantle, where volcanoes return the silicates, sulfates, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen to the surface.<br/><br/>Almost every step of the erosion process is catalyzed by water. For instance, in your turn you may weather rock using crystallization (busting rock by growing evaporated salt crystals), then transport the remains to the River using creep (movement propelled by wet/dry and freeze/thaw cycles). Once plunked in the River, the eroded material is moved as sediment to the sea. Braided rivers carry the maximum sediment load, but they are the least stable (and the trickiest to play).<br/><br/>The role of erosion in atmosphere control is often overlooked. Every mountain is a titanic terraformer and greenhouse gas scrubber. Weathering removes 100 billion tons of oxygen and 800 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year. Although the biological functions of respiration and decay contribute more to the atmosphere than erosion, during many past episodes it was the other way around. Left unchecked, a major orogenic (mountain-building) event removes so much CO2 that the oceans would freeze over in less than an Erosion game turn (6 million years, the same scale as for the game American Megafauna). On the other hand, a major flood volcano such as the Deccan Traps has poured hundreds of trillions of tons of CO2 back into the air,  dwarfing the outputs of all human industry combined.<br/><br/>"}, "54373": {"rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Narrow Passages Set", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic540758.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"10123": "With Bowties"}, "average": "8", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"2478": "Master Maze"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic540758_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/>Like all sets from the Master Maze range from Dwarven Forge this modular dungeon set is designed for use with 25 mm minatures, has a 1 inch grid integrated into the floor design, and comes fully painted.<br/><br/>While many of the older Master Maze sets have been recently re-released without bowtie connector system, this is one of the few that came with a different mix of pieces in the new set.<br/><br/>Narrow Passages Set (with bowties version) contents:<br/>8 Short Straight Narrow Passages<br/>4 Narrow, Right Angle Passages<br/>4 Narrow T-Shaped Passages<br/>2 Narrow 4-Way Passage<br/>2 Narrow To Wide Conversion Passages<br/>2 Narrow Swinging Doors<br/>50 Bowtie Connectors<br/>    <br/>Narrow Passages Set (without bowties version) contents:<br/>10 Short Straight Narrow Passages<br/>4 Narrow, Right Angle Passages<br/>4 Narrow T-Shaped Passages<br/>4 Narrow 4-Way Passage<br/>2 Narrow To Wide Conversion Passages<br/>4 Narrow Swinging Doors<br/>2 Narrow Dead Ends<br/><br/>"}, "54374": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4754": {"name": "Makoto Nakajima"}}, "average": "6", "statistics": {}, "name": "Toukai-yuukyouden: Jirotyo-sangokushi", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic544369_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"23910": "Sawshun Yamaguchi"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3133": {"name": "Kokusai-Tsushin Co., Ltd.

Something has stirred these monstrous humanoids, but the cause is in dispute. Some say that treasure hunters, searching in vain for a golden relic of a Uropan priest, have inadvertently roused the haints, who may be the ruined remnants of a century-old expeditionary force of mercenaries led by a notorious plunderer. Others say that the mercenary captain\u02bcs spirit has awoken after a century-long sleep, and is sending forth his followers to exact revenge upon the town that resisted his brutal search for gold and led to the destruction of his company.<br/><br/>In this adventure module, the PCs will piece together the history of the area from interactions with a young Yuchi cleric and a Kelt innkeeper. They will battle both the haints and a sinister Vandalian agent as they explore the caves, seeking to solve the mystery of these attacks.
