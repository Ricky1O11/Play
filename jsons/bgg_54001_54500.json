However, it has expanded beyond those narrow roots and can easily be used for more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; play. Section five gives tips and tricks on how to play Snowball in either mode.<br/><br/>Like its ancestors, Snowball is a role-playing game geared towards a narrative collaboration between a GM and one or more players. Characters in Snowball are not defined by assigning values to a list of pre-approved attributes in an attempt to balance them against an objective standard. Instead, they are defined through a series of Traits, whose only rating is how important such Traits are to the story.<br/><br/>In Snowball, the influence players have on events is not limited solely to dictating the actions of their characters. By invoking Traits, suggesting Ideas, and gambling dice, the players can actively direct the story, essentially assuming the role of the GM for brief periods of time.<br/><br/>Creating a story can sometimes be seen as a hike up the top of a high mountain, trying to reach the peak. In Snowball, everyone starts at the top, and the story naturally rolls down to the bottom, gathering more details in the trip.<br/><br/>"}, "54061": {"rpgartist": ["Stuart Beale", "Andrew Currie", "Lee Gibbons", "Simon Gurr", "Keith Jackson"], "statistics": [], "name": "Arcane (Issue 19 - May 1997)", "rpgdesigner": ["Andy Butcher", "Dan Joyce"], "rpgproducer": ["Dan Abnett", "Mark Barter", "Jon Billington", "Mark Donald", "Steve Faragher", "Clare Johnson", "Andy Lanning", "Phil Masters", "John Milner", "Alan Neill", "Jason Nicoll", "Gary O'Connell", "Jonathan Palmer", "Steve Peterson", "Paul Pettengale", "Hywel Phillips", "Andrew Rilstone", "James Swallow", "Lucya Szachnowski", "Adam Tinworth", "John Tynes", "Jo Walton", "Ken Walton"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic539255.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpgissue": ["Arcane"], "rpgissuearticle": ["Alien Invasion", "Arcane Scribblings and Reader Ads", "Capsule Reviews", "Champions: The New Millennium", "Cheats Never Prosper", "Deck Engines", "Despatches", "For Mature Readers", "Game Worlds", "Gnome World: Dai Hard", "Join the club", "Love to Hate", "Magic: The Gathering 5th Edition", "Magic: The Gathering CD-ROM", "My Deck", "Nobody's Perfect", "Retro Review: Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay", "The Source: The Legend of Robin Hood", "Star Wars Introductory Adventures Game", "The Blue Dragon Restaurant", "The Mechanics of Magic"], "rpg": ["Arcane"], "rpgpublisher": ["Future Publishing"], "rpgissueversion": ["Arcane 19"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic539255_t.jpg", "description": "CONTENTS<br/><br/>This issue contained (on the front cover) a copy of &quot;Forgotten Futures&quot; mini-RPG by Marcus L Rowland.<br/>which contained the senario  Taking the Tunnel<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/><br/><br/>     Alien Invasion<br/>     Nobody's Perfect<br/>     The Game Of The Book<br/>     Mechanics Of Magic<br/>     Encounter: The Blue Dragon Restaurant<br/>     How To Run A Club<br/>     Deck Engines<br/><br/><br/>REVIEWS<br/><br/><br/>     Game Reviews<br/><br/><br/>REGULARS<br/><br/><br/>     Ed's Letter<br/>     News<br/>     Andrew Rilstone<br/>     On The Soapbox<br/>     Subscriptions<br/>     Back Issues<br/>     My Deck<br/>     Retro: Warhammer FRP<br/>     The Source<br/>     Arcane Scribblings<br/>     Reader Ads<br/>     Gnome World: Dai Hard Part 5<br/><br/><br/>"}, "54063": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic538724.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Peter A.

It is an age of legends and valiant sagas too. And this is one of them.<br/>The Crimson Edda<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>Barbarians of Lemuria is a heroic role-playing game (RPG) set firmly in the swords &amp; sorcery genre. Lemuria is a post-apocalyptic world of half a million years into the future and unrecognisable to anyone today. It has returned to an almost prehistoric state; a land of humid steaming jungles, vast untamed wildernesses, horror-filled swamplands and hot dry deserts. Massive man-eating beasts roam the unexplored regions of Lemuria and beyond, from islet-sized sea serpents capable of sinking war-galleys to the huge jungle-dwelling dinosaurs that can swallow a man whole merely as an appetizer for bigger game.<br/><br/>The sword &amp; sorcery genre is a very specific one - characters are much more stereotypical than in other fantasy settings - heroes are all muscle-bound barbarians from the &ldquo;Frozen Wastes&rdquo;, mighty gladiators who fight for the thrill of the crowds or bawdy pirates with an eye for treasure and a yearning for adventure.  Women are voluptuous scantily clad beauties to be rescued from evil priests or lithe adventurers as capable in a fight as most ordinary men and just as ready to crack a barbarian&rsquo;s skull as bed him if spoken to lewdly. The bad guys are invariably evil necromancers, sorcerers, priests and druids. Sometimes they are lily-livered nobles or cunning assassins, but even they often have a magician behind their nefarious plots.<br/><br/>The main characters are never out to save the world from the minions of evil, they simply look out for themselves although this usually means in their own simple way they &lsquo;do the right thing&rsquo; in the end in any event. They are not heartless; they tend to stand up for those weaker than themselves and put down those who push others around. They are never inherently evil - that is the role of the villains or NPCs.<br/><br/>Heroes are first and foremost warriors and when times are hard will seek employment as soldiers, mercenaries, sailors or caravan guards to get by, often rising rapidly to higher positions as a result of their prowess. When nothing else is available they will often turn their hands to other, less honest, work. They will often be found turning to a life of thievery or piracy to make a few coins ...<br/><br/>"}, "54108": {"rpgdesigner": ["Lowell Francis", "Sherri Stewart"], "rpgitemversion": ["Draft"], "statistics": [], "name": "White Mountain, Black River", "rpgartist": ["Lowell Francis"], "rpgproducer": ["Lowell Francis", "Sherri Stewart"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1224998.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "7.5", "rpggenre": ["Culture (Asian / Far Eastern)", "Fantasy", "Martial Arts"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "rpg": ["White Mountain, Black River"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1224998_t.jpg", "description": "From the designer:<br/>Our homebrew rpg rules for handling a fantasy wuxia based game.

At any time during his turn, he can <br/>(1) Summon basic or advanced pieces <br/>(2) Promote basic pieces to advanced pieces <br/>(3) Play cards<br/><br/>To do these 3 actions, costs must be paid first, which means discarding cards equal to the cost face down to a common discard pile. Whenever a card is played, the opponent may respond by playing a card. Cards are resolved first in last out. During opponent's turn, player may also play cards. Player can also modify the movement, capture or interaction with opposing piece of a piece in play by paying the cost of a Piece Modifier Action card. The effects of the modification lasts only the turn the card is played. Unsummoned pieces are in each player&rsquo;s reserve. When the pieces are captured (or destroyed), they are placed in each player&rsquo;s graveyard.<br/><br/>There are 2 types of cards. Actions go to the discard pile face up immediately while Permanents stay in play in front of the player who played them. Kings cannot be targeted or affected by cards unless specified. Player may not Check the opponent if he plays any card prior to his Move.<br/><br/>Each 2x2 board tile has a coloured circle in one of the squares. The circle indicates the square as a terrain of that colour.

With the deck, some friends, and sixty to ninety minutes you can tell a story of sweet, scared, vulnerable people doing their best to reach for acceptance (and maybe love) and avoid rejection and heartbreak.<br/><br/>Is this a kissing game?<br/><br/>For the characters? Hopefully. For the players? Probably not.<br/><br/>But yes, unlike some story-telling and roleplaying games, Misery Bubblegum focusses on romance, relationships, uncertainty and humor. There aren't any special rules for combat, car chases, daring escapes and grievous injuries. It's all just stuff you do while trying to impress the girl. If you want a little martial arts to spice up your romance story then Misery Bubblegum has you covered. If you want a little romance to spice up your martial arts story then there are other systems out there that do that better.<br/><br/>Why is it cool?<br/><br/>If you've already got plenty of games ideal for the sweet teen romance genre, what makes Misery Bubblegum stand out? It fits in your pocket and it fits in your life. You can run the game with nothing but the deck of cards ... no pencils, no paper, no markers, no dice. And it runs, from start to finish (creating characters and telling a story) in sixty to ninety minutes. If you want more than that you can, of course, play it again with the same characters. But if you've got a group of friends who are willing to commit to the time to play a typical board-game, but not willing to commit a whole evening (or several evenings) to an epic story game, Misery Bubblegum gives you a way to get your story-juices flowing without asking for more than your group is ready to give.<br/><br/>"}, "54149": {"rpgartist": ["Aileen E.

Many of these monsters and treasures are of a more powerful nature than will be found in most fantasy role-playing campaigns.  This is intentional, for we feel that this will provide a greater challenge and incentive to those more experienced players who, since fantasy role-playing has been around now for a number of years, must be aquiring higher and higher level characters.  We also include less powerful monsters such as Fungus Men, Termite People, Goons, etc., and lower power items such as the Doorknob of Unrestrained Entry, Vibroblade, Breathing Device, etc.  In addition, we provide several charts and lists in the back of this book to aid in the playing of these monsters and treasures.

Program it.<br/>Your body is a shell. Change it.<br/>Death is a disease. Cure it.<br/>Extinction is approaching. Fight it.&quot;<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>The Game<br/>Humanity stands on the cusp of a new age, with accelerated technological growth converging toward a singularity point, promising an undreamt-of future. Despite the ecopocalypse and social upheavals on Earth, humanity has conquered the solar system and partially terraformed Mars. Advancements in biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science have transformed our lives. Everyone is wirelessly networked with the world around them, AIs process vast amounts of information, and nano-fabrication enables people to &quot;print&quot; complex devices from the molecular level - at home. Biotechnology allows people to genefix, enhance, and clone their bodies, while others pursue body modifications to adapt to new environments or make themselves into something no longer quite human. People&rsquo;s minds and memories can be digitized, uploaded, transferred over long distances, and downloaded into new bodies (biological or synthetic). Death has been defeated - for those who can afford it.<br/><br/>From within, disaster struck. Transhumanity reaped the rewards of its arrogance when conflict spiked between the battered nations of Earth, already weakened by decades of climate catastrophes and other disruptive factors. Rampant netwars soon exploded into physical conflicts with spiraling body counts. In the midst of these aggressions, a group of military AIs known as TITANS quietly achieved full sentience and autonomy, and rapidly began exponentially incrementing their own intellectual growth. The AI intelligences spawned by this hard-takeoff singularity quickly turned against transhumanity, enveloping the system in unprecedented levels of violence, disaster, and warfare. What began as a whirlwind of conflict between political factions, revolutionaries, and hypercorps soon escalated into a struggle between man and machine.<br/><br/>In just a few years, transhumanity was nearly wiped out with nuclear strikes, biowarfare plagues, destructive nanoswarms, infowar attacks, mass uploads, and other unexplained singularity events, ripping the superpowers of old to pieces. Our planetary home &quot;Earth&quot; was transformed into a toxic and strange hellhole, while many major habitats were left frozen sarcophagi in the vacuum of space. Just as quickly as they came, the TITANS disappeared, taking millions of uploaded minds with them, leaving behind a network of wormhole gateways. Known as Pandora Gates, these poorly-understood devices allow instantaneous teleportation to distant star systems - often one-way and/or fatal. Though only a handful of Pandora Gates are known to exist - each highly contested - the foolish, brave, curious, and desperate are already risking certain death to enter and explore what lies beyond.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of the Fall, transhumanity lives on, divided into a patchwork of hypercorp combines, survivalist stations, transhuman faction species, and city-state habitats. Under the oppressive police states of immortal inner-system oligarchies, advanced technologies remain highly restricted, and refugee infomorphs are held in virtual slavery or resleeved in robotic bodies and forced into indentured labor. In the outer system, rebel transhuman scientists and techno-anarchists struggle to maintain a new society - from each according to their imagination and to each according to their need. And on the fringes and in the niches lurk networked tribes of political extremists, religious fanatics, criminal entrepeneurs, and bizarre posthumans, among other, stranger, and more alien things ...<br/><br/>Though most claim the Fall was carefully orchestrated by the out-of-control TITANS, others whisper that the driving powers behind the wars - both AI and transhuman - were infected by a mutating virus with multiple infection vectors - biological, information, nano - dubbed the Exsurgent virus. Whatever its source, this virus has been known to sometimes transform its victims into something unexplainable ... something monstrous and reality-altering. Whatever the truth, the remnants of the TITANS and this virus were left to the desolated ruins or driven to the edges of the system, where they remain hidden away in dark corners, quietly waiting to infect the minds of the scavengers and explorers who find them ...<br/><br/>System<br/>Eclipse Phase uses a variant d100/percentile system with some twists. The game is fast and simple, streamlined so players can dive into the world and action without being burdened down by complex rules.<br/><br/>"}, "54246": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "statistics": [], "name": "vs. Monsters Anthology", "rpgdesigner": ["Justin D.

Imagine roleplaying in the setting of favorite humorous fantasy film or novel (e.g., Shrek, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Princess Bride, etc.); Murphy's World is design to encompass all of these and more. It is the Realm of Faerie, the Land of Myths and Legends, the place of popular folklore and dreams (with a dash of pop culture) - comically twisted, yet maintaining an internal sense of logic. What makes it most unusual it that it operates according to Murphy's Laws -'If something can go wrong, it will.'<br/><br/>The real culprit is the planet's sun, Ludo. The chaotic energies with which this amber orb assaults the little planet effectively toss any sense of predictability of natural laws or supernatural forces right out the metaphysical window. Even magic is possible on Murphy's World, but the results can be somewhat... unpredictable.<br/><br/>Murphy's World also happens to be in possession of an extensive but faulty network of interdimensional Teleportation Gates, connecting Murphy's World to just about everywhere. Thus many of the planet's residents are like Murphy - reluctant alien immigrants. New arrivals scan pop up (in, down, or sideways) anywhere; confused, occasionally embarrassed, and always wondering how to get back where they came from. Unfortunately, spaceships usually crash upon entering the atmosphere, and return Gates are often invisible, faulty, or completely out of order.&quot;<br/><br/>and:<br/><br/>&quot;Inside the Murphy&rsquo;s World RPG Book: Everything Necessary to Start Adventuring!<br/><br/>     Descriptions of the planet, the chaotic effects of its sun Ludo, magic and the supernatural, and the Teleportation Gates.<br/>     Fourteen races and cultures described via their Physical Characteristics &amp; Abilities, Special Traits &amp; Powers, Language, Geographic Distribution &amp; Settlements, Customs &amp; Lifestyle, Skills &amp; Labor Practices, Religion &amp; Superstition, plus a profile of several actual settlements and kingdoms.<br/>     Easy to learn and play rules that include Character Creation &amp; Improvement, Skills &amp; Abilities, Action Resolution, and a wacky Magic System that the Gamemaster may use to torment spellcasters; if the details of their spell are not explicitly defined it is open to misinterpretation!.<br/>     Lots of GM tips on how to design adventures and establish an ongoing campaign, along with numerous Adventure Ideas and tables to randomly generate places, things, creatures, and people.

At the end of each round, gain  points for cards in your mountain and delta.<br/><br/>The basic rules introduce the four player actions: Weathering,  Hillslope, Fluvial, and Draw Cards. The advanced rules add details: atmospheric change, ice  ages, glaciers, flood volcanism, quakes, etc.<br/><br/>Mountains are far more dynamic than the limitations of human  lifetimes would suggest. Their growth and death involve cycles that keep the planet habitable. The machinery of these cycles is called erosion: the weathering of rock and its transport to the sea. Once there, it is subducted into the mantle, where volcanoes return the silicates, sulfates, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen to the surface.<br/><br/>Almost every step of the erosion process is catalyzed by water. For instance, in your turn you may weather rock using crystallization (busting rock by growing evaporated salt crystals), then transport the remains to the River using creep (movement propelled by wet/dry and freeze/thaw cycles). Once plunked in the River, the eroded material is moved as sediment to the sea. Braided rivers carry the maximum sediment load, but they are the least stable (and the trickiest to play).<br/><br/>The role of erosion in atmosphere control is often overlooked. Every mountain is a titanic terraformer and greenhouse gas scrubber. Weathering removes 100 billion tons of oxygen and 800 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year. Although the biological functions of respiration and decay contribute more to the atmosphere than erosion, during many past episodes it was the other way around. Left unchecked, a major orogenic (mountain-building) event removes so much CO2 that the oceans would freeze over in less than an Erosion game turn (6 million years, the same scale as for the game American Megafauna). On the other hand, a major flood volcano such as the Deccan Traps has poured hundreds of trillions of tons of CO2 back into the air,  dwarfing the outputs of all human industry combined.<br/><br/>"}, "54373": {"rpgdesigner": ["Stefan Pokorny"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "poll": [], "name": "Narrow Passages Set", "rpgartist": ["Stefan Pokorny"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic540758.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["With Bowties", "Without Bowties"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dwarven Forge"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "rpgseries": ["Master Maze"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic540758_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/>Like all sets from the Master Maze range from Dwarven Forge this modular dungeon set is designed for use with 25 mm minatures, has a 1 inch grid integrated into the floor design, and comes fully painted.<br/><br/>While many of the older Master Maze sets have been recently re-released without bowtie connector system, this is one of the few that came with a different mix of pieces in the new set.<br/><br/>Narrow Passages Set (with bowties version) contents:<br/>8 Short Straight Narrow Passages<br/>4 Narrow, Right Angle Passages<br/>4 Narrow T-Shaped Passages<br/>2 Narrow 4-Way Passage<br/>2 Narrow To Wide Conversion Passages<br/>2 Narrow Swinging Doors<br/>50 Bowtie Connectors<br/>    <br/>Narrow Passages Set (without bowties version) contents:<br/>10 Short Straight Narrow Passages<br/>4 Narrow, Right Angle Passages<br/>4 Narrow T-Shaped Passages<br/>4 Narrow 4-Way Passage<br/>2 Narrow To Wide Conversion Passages<br/>4 Narrow Swinging Doors<br/>2 Narrow Dead Ends<br/><br/>"}, "54374": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Makoto Nakajima"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "name": "Toukai-yuukyouden: Jirotyo-sangokushi", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "2007", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic544369_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Sawshun Yamaguchi"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Kokusai-Tsushin Co., Ltd.

After advancing several dozen miles they stopped to secure their supply lines, only to meet a devastating British counter-attack that soon had them reeling back halfway across Libya. For the next two and a half years, Axis and Allied armies surged back and forth across the North African desert until finally Gen. Bernard Law Montgomery's British Eighth Army wrecked Erwin Rommel's vaunted Panzer Army Africa.<br/><br/>Western Desert Force is a quick-playing game from the same designer as our Defiant Russia, following the same philosophy: a game you can play in just an hour or two, with the emphasis on tense action and lots of fun.<br/><br/>The map portrays the North Africa from El Agheila to Alexandria. It's divided into hexagons, at a scale of 15 miles across each.<br/><br/>Players control the actual units that fought in this campaign. Units are divisions, brigades and regiments with some battalions. The Axis player controls German, Italian and Italian Colonial (Libyan) units; the Allied player leads British, Australian, New Zealand, South African, Indian, Polish, Jewish, Free French and Greek units in the fight against fascism.<br/><br/>The objectives for each side are simple: kick the enemy out of North Africa. The strategy is not so easy: the Allies must hold on to protect the Suez Canal; the Axis must choke off this vital waterway. Neither can afford to be ejected from the otherwise worthless desert.<br/><br/>The game design is by William Sariego, and development is by industry veteran Paul Dangel in his Avalanche Press debut.<br/><br/>Western Desert Force includes:<br/><br/>     One 33&quot;x17&quot; map<br/>     Full-color play aids<br/>     140 game pieces<br/>     16-page rulebook<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>(source: Avalanche Press website)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "7", "name": "Western Desert Force", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "9", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Avalanche Press WWII Battles Series"]}, "54452": {"rpgdesigner": ["Matt Coville", "Kenneth Hite", "Owen Seyler"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing 2001"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Adventure Game", "rpgartist": ["George Vasilakos"], "rpgproducer": ["Steven S.

It is designed to be a very challenging experience for a party of four 1st-level PCs or a moderately difficult adventure for 2nd-level PCs.<br/><br/>From the synopsis:<br/><br/>The Yuchi town of Chisca, nestled in a mountain vale deep in Cherokee territory, is attacked by<br/>haints issuing from the nearby caves. Something has stirred these monstrous humanoids, but the cause is in dispute. Some say that treasure hunters, searching in vain for a golden relic of a Uropan priest, have inadvertently roused the haints, who may be the ruined remnants of a century-old expeditionary force of mercenaries led by a notorious plunderer. Others say that the mercenary captain\u02bcs spirit has awoken after a century-long sleep, and is sending forth his followers to exact revenge upon the town that resisted his brutal search for gold and led to the destruction of his company.<br/><br/>In this adventure module, the PCs will piece together the history of the area from interactions with a young Yuchi cleric and a Kelt innkeeper. They will battle both the haints and a sinister Vandalian agent as they explore the caves, seeking to solve the mystery of these attacks. A final confrontation with the ancient mercenary captain himself, another surprise villain, and with<br/>the agent who allowed him to rise and renew his campaign of terror, caps the story and points to<br/>further opportunities for adventure.<br/><br/>"}, "54459": {"rpgartist": ["Keith Curtis", "Derek Salemme"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Hero System Resource Kit (5th Edition)", "rpgdesigner": ["Steven S.
