You have various weapons at your disposal, like flame throwers, grenades and machine guns, which the henchmen will drop when you dispatch them. Another feature implemented into the game is that of stealth. When Tardiez's henchmen appear, or even before, you can hide in the shadows of doorways, over and behind walls and in areas of complete darkness. This also allows you to switch between any available weapons you have on your person. The whole game takes place within a time limit of just 2 hours.

Repeated tragedies at the Acadamy have made people aware that the legend of the existence of the 'Witch of the Acadamy' may indeed be true.<br/><br/>To get rid of the witch, 5 members of academy start the research about the  legend of the Witch.<br/><br/>The aim of the members of this group  is to find and to get rid of the witch.<br/><br/>By the way, the legend also says that the witch can transform into whomever the witch has killed.<br/><br/>This means there is always a question about,  if one of the research members is already a witch.<br/>  <br/>Humans have their own magic which is different from magic users from far beyond the beginning of the academy.

Ariolasoft published the game in Europe. Originally developed for the Apple II, it was ported to the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and Macintosh in 1985 and to the Amiga and Atari ST in 1986. The game was produced by Stewart Bonn, and Richard Hilleman also supported Ray Tobey's work; both would later become high-ranking EA product development executives.<br/><br/>In this game, the player pilots the Skyfox, the most advanced attack fighter plane available to the fictional government, the Federation. The plane's armaments consist of radar guided missiles, deflection shields, laser cannons, heat-seeking missiles and a top speed of Mach 4. The gameplay consists of fighting tanks, enemy planes and the enemy motherships. The game has a total of 15 scenarios and 5 skill levels.<br/><br/>Featuring a view from the cockpit of the jet, this game is recognized as popularizing this view. The cockpit featured radar which showed incoming missiles and other threats. Flying above the clouds, the player fights hordes of enemy planes. Flying below them, the player is attacked by enemy tanks. Hailed upon its release, most criticisms of the game cited repetitive gameplay as the only drawback.<br/><br/>The game was followed by a sequel, Skyfox II: The Cygnus Conflict, set in space.<br/><br/>Tobey thought a player could get bored flying an advanced fighter plane, and might want to play a game. Consequently, he incorporated a Space Invaders game into Skyfox as a hidden Easter egg.

The romantic world of sea adventures, political intrigue, piracy and massive ocean battles, ancient sea customs and a first glimpse into a future epoch - these are only fragments of the multi-faceted universe of &quot;Privateer's Bounty&quot;.<br/><br/>The game expands upon the sailing tactical simulation concept, using Age of Sail II as its launching point for innovation. This solid foundation makes &quot;Privateer's Bounty&quot; the ideological successor of this remarkable game.<br/><br/>Player mission objectives vary from the total annihilation of the enemy to brutal fort assaults, from &quot;capture the flagship&quot; to fleeing from an enemy-seized bay. Experienced players will note changes to the fleet control system, battle conducting principles, networking and several other aspects of the game. These changes result in a deeper emergence into the game and, as a consequence, a popular alignment towards the sphere of tactical real-time games.<br/><br/>A dynamic, intuitive unit interface simplifies the control of large squadrons. New damage calculation algorithms have been specially optimized for the needs of a dynamic tactical game. This enables a realistic battle situation to be simulated with precision.<br/><br/>We've analyzed the suggestions of our sea-strategy game fans when designing the game interface. As a result, the new interface allows for individual adjustment of windows arrangements and numerous hot key customizations. Additional game adjustment options allow the player to tune the game for computers of any configuration.<br/><br/>The single-player game includes three large campaigns based on some of the historical events of the 19th century. While the campaigns are grounded in a historical context, the design emphasis is placed upon the unique spirit of each epoch.

Smith's objective is to rescue a missing Viper agent in each of the syndicate's seven hideouts and uncover clues of the Syndicate's true mastermind.<br/><br/>The gameplay system is similar to Namco's 1986 arcade game Rolling Thunder. Like in Rolling Thunder, the player can jump or drop down between floors by holding the directional pad up or down and pressing the jump button, as well as enter doors to obtain power-ups or avoid enemies. The player can be armed with one of two weapons (a standard issue pistol or a semi-automatic machine gun for continuous firepower). Items includes additional ammunition for either weapon, extra health, a time extension, and extra lives. Unlike Rolling Thunder, the player can shoot while jumping and can also change directions during midair.<br/><br/>Another difference between Rolling Thunder and Code Name: Viper is the added emphasis on rescuing hostages. Throughout the first seven stages, the player can find captured civilians behind certain doors, who will offer the player their gratitude. However, if the player takes too long to rescue certain hostages, the player will only find their skeletal remains. To complete each of the first seven stages, the player must rescue a captured commando who will provide the grenades necessary to blow up the obstruction blocking the exit at the end of each stage.<br/><br/>The strength and attack patterns of the standard enemy soldiers that the player will face is determined by the colors of their outfit. In addition to the standard enemy soldiers will face other adversaries such as Snipers, Frogmen, and Maniacs.

If, at any point, no dice rolled score, then all points set aside in that turn are lost, and the dice passed to the next player.  Following any roll in which at least one dice scores, the active player may 'bank' the points accumulated that turn, and pass the dice to the next player.  The next player then has the option of building on that score by rolling only the non-scoring dice, or picking up all five dice and starting from zero.  At any time, the active player may call 'portito', which has the effect of flipping all dice following the roll: 1s become 6s, 2 become 5s, etc.  The player remains 'portito' until calling 'normal', which they can only do when the dice are in their possession (so you remain 'portito' while the dice go round the players).  The game continues until one player exactly reaches some pre-determined target score: 5000 or 10000 is common.<br/><br/>Scoring dice within each roll are as follows:<br/>1 = 100 points<br/>5 = 50 points<br/>3 of a kind = dice score * 100<br/><br/>"}, "78699": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Night Shift", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"157981": "French Amstrad CPC Disk edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784685.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "usersrated": "4", "average": "6.625", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"4415": "Amiga"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic784685_t.jpg", "description": "From back of box:<br/><br/>309 - Help Wanted, Factor Work<br/><br/>Quick Worker Needed for night Shift<br/><br/>Famous toy company needs energetic self-starter to operate slightly unreliable machine on the 9:00pm to 4:00am shift. <br/>Must be able to do ten things at once.

The game's background graphics featured broad landscapes with changing sunlight effects with detail and clarity not previously seen in video games.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Rastan (arcade game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78711": {"videogame": {"94075": "Taito Legends 2"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Raimais", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"56411": "Arcade Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561352.png", "videogametheme": {"2331": "Space"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "5.5", "videogamegenre": {"2407": "Maze"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"94075": "Taito Legends 2"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561352_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Raimais is a Pacman clone with a space theme.<br/><br/>"}, "78712": {"videogame": {"94075": "Taito Legends 2"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "KiKi KaiKai", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"56412": "Japanese Arcade Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1556519.png", "videogametheme": {"2427": "Alternate Historical"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "7.25", "videogamegenre": {"2505": "Shoot 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"94075": "Taito Legends 2"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1556519_t.png", "description": "&quot;KiKi KaiKai (\u5947\u3005\u602a\u754c lit. &quot;Mysterious Ghost World&quot;) is a multi-directional shooter developed and published by Taito Corporation originally for Japanese arcades in 1986.

His customer is ten floors away, all of them crawling with bioweapons.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D/Generation,&quot' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D/Generation,&quot</a>; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78730": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Burai Fighter", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"283826": "Australian NES edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786142.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "5", "average": "6.6", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4422": "Game Boy"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786142_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Defeat the Burai using massive weaponry!<br/>In a remote corner of the galaxy, there lives a race of super brains known as the Burai.

It was first released on October 18, 1985 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, as one of the 18 initial launch games. A month later, on November 21, the title was released in Japan. On March 15, 1987 it was released in Europe and Australia. In July 2007 a modified version was released on the Wii's Virtual Console, which allowed designed tracks to be saved.<br/><br/>Mach Rider takes place in the year 2112, and planet Earth  has been invaded by evil forces known as Quadrunners. The player controls Mach Rider, who travels from sector to sector on a motorcycle, searching for survivors and destroying the enemies in his path.<br/><br/>The game's controls are somewhat more complex than other games at its time. The left and right directions on the Control Pad steer Mach Rider and the A button accelerates. The B button fires Mach Rider's machine gun which can be used to destroy enemies and obstacles on the road. The up and down buttons are used to change gears. Mach Rider's bike has four gears and travels at an immense speed in top gear.<br/><br/>In each round, points can be scored by destroying enemies and certain obstacles with the machine gun. The number of points scored for destroying enemies and obstacles are determined by the power of the enemy destroyed and the type of obstacle destroyed. If the player &quot;BLOCKS&quot; an enemy by knocking it into a hazard on the track, they obtain more points, and this also replenishes Mach Rider's bullets.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Mach Rider , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78732": {"rpgitemversion": {"56468": "Saddle Stapled Version"}, "rpgseries": {"7732": "H\u00e4rskarserien"}, "name": "Handelsfursten", "rpgproducer": {"11568": "Nils Gulliksson"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1234006.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": {"1925": "Ereb Altor"}, "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1909": "Drakar och Demoner (Expert, 4th & Chronopia 5th Editions)"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1234006_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book (in Swedish):<br/><br/>Den sydl&auml;ndska &ouml;gruppen Pandarealia &auml;r en v&auml;lm&aring;ende nation v&auml;ster om Ereb.

The game is the first game published by R&amp;D Games that has not been designed by Richard Breese.  Richard this time takes on the role of developer and the game consequently has the same look and feel as the previous Key games, with artwork again by Juliet Breese plus its own set of ani-/vegi-/arti-meeples.<br/><br/>Each player controls an extended family of workers.  Over the course of two years, players will organise their workers in an attempt to turn their initial scanty resources into a thriving economic system.<br/><br/>After an initial set up phase, the game is played over eight seasons.  Each season has three distinct phases, during which players may take a variety of actions.  The topography, weather, and seasons will influence the ability of workers to produce crops and livestock in the fields and luxuries in the villages.  In addition, resources and luxuries may be bought and sold in the market, or gold and favours sought and acquired.  Other workers may be sponsored to join the powerful guilds, where they will acquire skills as they gain promotion to become craftsmen or even the guild master.<br/><br/>Turn order throughout the game is determined by the player&rsquo;s position on the season track, which changes at the end of each season.  At the end of the game, the player who has acquired the most gold will win the game.<br/><br/>David Brain&rsquo;s designer notes on the box sides conclude by stating that &lsquo;Key Market is a reasonably intricate game.  Some of the strategies that can be employed (particularly the effective use of the market) are not immediately apparent, and some of the Guild combinations do not look so devastating at first glance.

The main goal is to destroy the two opposing AI's home command stations without losing yours (in multiplayer the humans will not lose until all human home command stations have been lost). As with chess, AI War is generally thought of in the three stages of opening, middlegame, and endgame, all of which involve different player and AI interactions and activities.<br/><br/>Maps vary in size from 10-120 systems and map size has a significant impact on the play style of the game as well as time required. The game starts out with the human player(s) each controlling one system (though they may choose to start with more) and the AI controlling the rest of the map. Unlike conventional RTS games where the AI will basically emulate a human opponent, the AI operates off something called AI Progress. This mechanic works as an indicator of how aware the AI is of the leftover human remnants in the galaxy (as well as to balance the fact that if the AI simply attacked the player with everything it had at the start of the game it would win every time). As players complete objectives and capture systems, this value goes up, increasing the volume of reinforcements and attack forces the AI gets to use. There are a few mechanics such as Data Centers and the newly introduced AI Superterminals that lower the AI Progress. One of the primary factors when considering whether to take a planet is the AI progress; taking planets raises it and taking too many will cause the player to be overrun.<br/><br/>AI War supports dynamic cooperation where up to eight players can play together and drop in and out of the game at any time. One effect of this is a group game between friends does not require everybody to be around for each game session, nor does the lobby have to be remade to continue playing if another shows up. As of 3.0, players who join mid-game are given a special colony ship that allows them to start playing without leaning on the other players to gift them systems/units as much.<br/><br/>AI War also uses strong disincentives to micromanage units in order to help players manage such a large empire without getting bogged down in details, being more important to choose planets wisely and balance your forces than to control said forces exact behavior.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, AI War: Fleet Command , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78752": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Exteel", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"56499": "US online version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786938.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2278": "Anime"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2167": "Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic786938_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Exteel was a free-to-play third-person shooter developed and published by NCsoft.<br/><br/>Players use tall, several story high, Gundam-like Mechanaughts to fight CPU-controlled Mechanaughts and other players in neon-lit city-scapes.<br/><br/>The Mechanaughts themselves were customizable for-free to a small degree.

The teams were: Chicago Bears, Denver Broncos, Houston Oilers, Los Angeles Rams, Miami Dolphins, New York Giants, San Francisco 49ers and Washington Redskins.<br/><br/>The game used an isometric view, presenting the game at an angle to make it appear 3-D, and the game allowed a very large number of moving objects (all the players) to be on screen at the same time; in earlier games, the system couldn't handle it. In a typical NES game, few moving objects could be onscreen before they all started flashing, because the system couldn't render them all at once, but NES PAF managed to avoid this somehow and allow the system to render two entire football teams onscreen simultaneously.<br/><br/>Another feature that was ahead of its time was the use of real voices. NES PAF was one of an extremely small number of NES games to feature voices. Most games never bothered to implement this feature because of the primitive sound capabilities, but in NES PAF, players hear the referee say in a real voice &quot;Touchdown!&quot; or &quot;First down!&quot; You can even hear the football players yell &quot;Ready! Set! Hut, hut..&quot; before the play begins.

It was released in 1989 in Japan and in 1990 in North America.<br/><br/>From game box:<br/><br/>Something was terribly wrong in the distant man-made Spondylus Solar System. One by one the planet's central life support computers had been infected with a life threatening virus while the planet surfaces had been overrun with computerized dinosaurs known as Robosaurs. Under attack in his laboratory on Alpha Planet, Professor Proteus, the mastermind of the Spondylus System and the founder of the Robosaur project suddenly realized that this deadly sabotage could only be the work of his former partner, the deranged Dr. Brainius.<br/><br/>Years earlier, the doctor had fled Alpha Planet after Professor Proteus had exposed him for performing forbidden robotic experiments on human subjects. At last, he has returned to seek his revenge using the Professor's own creations! But little did he realize that Proteus had been hard at work for the past few years perfecting the ultimate Robosaur, Cyborasaurus.<br/><br/>There was only one hope to save the Spondylus System.<br/><br/>There are two modes of gameplay. The player controls either Professor Proteus in his battlesuit, or Cyborasaurus, a truly devastating Robosaur. Capsules that Robosaurs drop can help to keep these two entities alive. Capsules labeled &quot;E&quot; will fully replenish the player's energy. Capsules labeled &quot;B&quot; give the player a full barrier meter. Any damage taken will deplete the barrier meter before affecting the energy meter.<br/><br/>Stages, each on different planets ranging from ice to jungle, begin by piloting Cyborasaurus. The goal is to get to the Artificial Intelligence Compound of each planet. Hoards of Robosaurs stand in the way of Cyborasaurus, including a boss of each level. These behemoths can take far more damage than standard Robosaurs. When defeated, the boss will leave behind a key to the AIC.<br/><br/>When in the AIC, Proteus exits Cyborasaurus. Every AIC has a Life-Support Computer that has been infected with a virus which must be destroyed. Platforms of Deception, Flying Hounds of Destruction, and other obstacles must be circumnavigated before battle with the hideous pulsating Life-Support Computer can begin. When the computer is destroyed, all beasts in the AIC are destroyed along with it. Proteus must then retrace his steps back to Cyborasaurus. Cyborasaurus then must use the Molecular Transporter outside to travel to the next planet.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Dynowarz , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78763": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bomberman 64", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"56513": "Europe N64 Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1111404.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4932": "Bomberman"}, "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5755": "Bomberman"}, "average": "6.28053", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4836": "Nintendo 64"}, "usersrated": "38", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1111404_t.jpg", "description": "Bomberman 64 is the first 3-D game within the Bomberman  series. It also implements a different single-player mode by incorporating action-adventure and platforming stages, instead of arenas in which enemies or other elements must be destroyed.<br/><br/>This game is featured in full 3D, thus the directional controls change. Bomberman is able to walk in eight directions with a rotating camera facing in eight directions and with three different zooms. His bombs have a different effect than in other games of the series; the bomb's explosion waves have a spherical pattern rather than the traditional cross-shaped ones.<br/><br/>In both single player and multiplayer modes, Bomberman always has the ability to kick, pick up, and throw bombs, without the need of powerups, as in previous games. A unique feature of this game is that Bomberman can &quot;pump&quot; a bomb while holding it, which will make the bomb's explosion more powerful. A pumped-up bomb cannot be kicked or picked up again. Unlike most platform games of its time, Bomberman cannot jump, nor can he swim in water, although he can wade in shallow water. Since Bomberman lacks the ability to jump, higher areas that do not have a path leading to them must be reached by bouncing across bombs - typically this requires the &quot;remote&quot; power-up to avoid the normally timed bombs exploding early. &quot;Bomb jumping&quot; is actually required to fully explore most levels, retrieve certain power-ups, and cross many obstacles.<br/><br/>If Bomberman runs into an enemy NPC, or is hit on the head by a small object, such as an unexploded bomb, he will get knocked out temporarily (he will sit there dizzy with &quot;X&quot; eyes and stars rotating around his head). While in this state, he can get picked up by an enemy and thrown around or even off the map. Conversely, Bomberman can do the same to an enemy.<br/><br/>When Bomberman takes damage, he dies. If he has a &quot;heart&quot; power-up when he's hit, he will survive, but he will lose the heart. When he dies all powerups that he had obtained will scatter all over the place. In the Normal single-player mode, taking damage simply causes Bomberman to drop the heart, and if it doesn't bounce off the level, he can pick it up again to survive another hit. In the Hard mode, the heart will simply disappear.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_64_%281997_video_game%29' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_64_%281997_video_game...</a>, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78764": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Siren: Blood Curse", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"117231": "EN/EU PlayStation 3 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic973081.jpg", "videogameseries": {"7060": "Siren"}, "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "average": "5.875", "videogamefranchise": {"6399": "The Best (Best Selling PlayStation Games, JP)"}, "videogameplatform": {"4435": "PlayStation 3"}, "usersrated": "8", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic973081_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher's web site:<br/><br/>An American TV crew has arrived in Japan to film an expose on the legend of the &ldquo;vanished village.&rdquo; Controlling seven different playable characters, the player must uncover the mystery behind the curse that grips the eerie village of Hanuda.

From 500 BC to 400 BC, the hoplites ruled supreme on the battlefield, fighting in classical Greece&rsquo;s most memorable conflict. From the battles of Thermopylae to Marathon and Plataea to the Peloponnesian Wars, hoplites decided the course of empires.<br/><br/>HPS Greek Wars brings this era to computer gaming, with a full panoply of scenarios of Greek versus Persian and Greek versus Greek. Greek Wars has over 60 scenarios in which Athenians, Spartans, Persians, and many more clash in battles which still resound today. Scenarios allow players to deploy armies of the era using the full range of classical weapons, from infantry spears to bows and various types of cavalry. Command anything from the famous 300 Spartans to the mass armies of the Persian empire, 100,000 strong.<br/><br/>Greek Wars includes an enhanced computer A.I. that plays an aggressive strategy against the gamer. In response, players must use their best formations and tactics to win the day. Game tactics are based on historical factors, so you can use the lessons from Herodotus and other ancient historians to win through. You may also face off against an opponent, or join in a multi-player PBEM battle with hundreds of units. Scenarios are drawn from history, or players can engage in balanced hypothetical matches from the table top series of battles<br/><br/>Greek Wars uses the HPS Ancient Warfare engine. This provides a hex based, tactical, plot, simultaneous resolution execution. A game turn is composed of three phases: (1) The player assigns commands to his units (movement, changing formation etc).

It is a predecessor to Twin Cobra. The player controls a helicopter named Tiger Heli taking out various enemies along the way.<br/><br/>The game is a vertical scrolling shooter where the player controls a helicopter taking on hordes of enemies which include tanks, battleships, and artillery. It is interesting to note that, besides some airplanes taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. The player's main weapon is an unlimited supply of missiles which travel a max distance of half the screen's height. The player also has two bombs which destroy all objects within a large circular radius. These bombs can be blown off by enemy bullets. The player is killed after only one hit, and is re-spawned to a point approximately one whole vertical screen-length later, thus progressing the player past the obstacle that had killed him, albeit at a high cost. The player is given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter. Flashing crosses scattered throughout each level award players power-ups depending on which color the cross is. A red cross will gives the player one side-firing mini-heli which shoots perpendicular to the player's helicopter. A white cross yields a forward firing mini-heli. It is possible to have a mix and match of side-helis, totaling no more than two. The green cross will award the player with an additional bomb, if the player currently has less than two. Grabbing power-ups when not necessary yields 5000 points.<br/><br/>There are a total of four stages, all of which start and end with a helipad. After completion of the last stage, the game will restart in a more difficult mode starting on stage 2. Most of the game's areas contain unnecessary objects to destroy for bonus points, such as oil drums and houses.

The stages are numbered by difficulty (1-4), and the choice of which level to play is made individually for each page. However, the availability of each difficulty level is based to some degree on the player's performance in the last-played stage. Each stage has three collectible hearts, and the number of hearts collected determines the highest level they will be allowed to choose on the next page, adding one to the amount collected.

It was created and released for Game Boy Color, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Windows.<br/><br/>The game received several positive reviews and sold well, becoming a PlayStation Greatest Hits game. The game soon spawned a sequel, Croc 2 which released in 1999. There were also two Croc games released on mobile phones made by a studio related to Argonaut named Morpheme (the first being a platformer titled Croc Mobile: Jungle Rumble, while the second was a pinball game titled Croc Mobile Pinball). However, the games now no longer exist, due to Morpheme's site no longer being available.<br/><br/>Croc is a free-roaming game title, with Croc's movement differing slightly depending on whether players use the directional pad or the analogue controller to control him. His main moves consist of a tail whip attack that can temporarily destroy enemies, and a butt stomp used for smashing open crates. Croc also possess the ability to swim in select levels. Throughout the game Croc collects crystals which serve as health in a similar fashion to golden rings in Sonic the Hedgehog. Meaning the player will lose a life if hit without holding any crystals in their inventory. Crystals retained at the end of a level are stored, with Croc gaining an extra life for every 100 he collects.<br/><br/>Progressing through the levels involves finding and hitting the Beany Gong at the end of the level to move onto the next, facing two bosses during each island. However, to fully complete the game, Croc has to rescue the captured Gobbos throughout each level. Each level contains six Gobbos, including one hidden behind a door at the end of the level. This Gobbo can only be released by collecting five coloured crystals throughout the level. Collecting all the Gobbos before a boss level unlocks an extra level in which a Jigsaw Piece can be earned. When the player collects all of these pieces, a new island is opened up, leading to the game's final boss, Baron Dante in crystal form.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Croc: Legend of the Gobbos , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78850": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Stargate", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"218287": "North American Genesis edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785797.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "videogamefranchise": {"7682": "Stargate"}, "average": "3", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4426": "SEGA Genesis"}, "usersrated": "3", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785797_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Stargate is a an action platforming game, based on the 1994 movie.

The arcade version was distributed in North America by Romstar. A home version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released during the same year. The original coin-op version is included in Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.<br/><br/>Set in a post-apocalyptic future during the aftermath of a nuclear war, the player takes control of a warrior who is hired to defeat the gang of an evil dictator. The hero is armed with a sword and shield, but has also been trained in the martial arts. The arcade version can be played by up to two players alternating. The game's controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons. Similarly to Kung-Fu Master or Rush'n Attack, the player jumps by holding the joystick upwards instead of having a dedicated jump button like other side-scrolling action games. Instead, one button is used to swing the sword at enemies and the other button is used to hold the shield to block enemy attacks, including projectiles such as throwing knives and arrows. The shield can be held towards the player while standing or crouching, as well as upwards vertically and diagonally. Some enemies will throw magic balls which will cause the player to lose their sword and shield if they block. During these instances, the player will fight barehanded, with the sword and shield buttons used to punch and kick respectively. The sword and shield will appear on-screen after some point, allowing the player to recover their weapon. Other power-ups includes floating hearts that will restore the player's health and jumping spots where the player can jump higher than usual.<br/><br/>The game consist of six stages, where the player will face the usual series of small fry enemies, as well as a sub-boss at the middle of each stage and a boss at the end. The player is allowed to start the game at any of the six stages. However, the player must play through the entire game again after defeating the final boss, Achilles, in order to see the true ending (similarly to Ghosts 'n Goblins). The player can continue after a game over depending on the dip switch settings.<br/><br/>The NES version of Trojan features several significant changes to the game, such as the addition of new power-ups and hidden rooms, as well as an alternative Versus Mode, where two players compete against each other in a best-two-out-of-three duel. Player 1 controls the main character, while Player 2 controls the enemy Trojan, whose abilities are identical to the main character. While the version in Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1 is a direct emulation of the original arcade game, it also allows the option to assign one of the action buttons for jumping in addition to using the directional pad or the analog stick.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Trojan (video game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78853": {"statistics": {}, "name": "War over Vietnam", "videogamemode": {"2410": "Asynchronous Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"56695": "Windows edition"}, "average": "2", "videogameseries": {"6937": "Modern Air Power"}, "videogametheme": {"2514": "Flight"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "description": "War Over Vietnam is a tactical air warfare simulation that features an extremely detailed and accurate depiction of the operational air war over the expansive Southeast Asia theater of operations.<br/><br/>Electronic warfare, including standoff jamming, chaff corridors, and self-protection ECM pods, helps strike aircraft penetrate successfully to their targets in the thick of the dense and lethal North Vietnamese air defenses.<br/><br/>A full suite of sensors is modeled, from ground controlled intercept and airborne warning and control radars down to SAM and AAA target-tracking radars.<br/><br/>War over Vietnam is the first computer game to attempt to authentically portray the full complement of offensive and defensive weaponry the &ldquo;River Rats&rdquo; employed when going &quot;Downtown&quot; over Route Pack Six.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "78854": {"statistics": {}, "name": "D-Day: America Invades", "videogamemode": {"2410": "Asynchronous Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"56696": "US DOS/Mac Version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic939322.jpg", "videogameseries": {"7454": "World at War"}, "videogametheme": {"2508": "Military"}, "usersrated": "4", "average": "9.25", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic939322_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the game box:<br/><br/>Test your skills as a WWII general in this historically accurate strategy game.

The game was the first wrestling game on the Nintendo Entertainment System and was ranked 172 on Nintendo Power's Top 200 Nintendo Games Ever.<br/><br/>The player chooses a wrestler with unique skills and presses various combinations of buttons to use different wrestling moves. It is possible to leave the ring; however, a player who does so must re-enter the ring before the referee's 20-count. Failure to do so results in a loss (via count-out) or a draw (double count-out), if both wrestlers fail to re-enter in time. (Note: The referee's count is broken only after both wrestlers have re-entered the ring. That is, as long as at least one wrestler is outside the ring, the referee's count continues. Moreover, it is possible for a wrestler to be counted out while executing a Plunger if he has crossed the ring ropes by the count of 20.)<br/><br/>The game was one of the first wrestling games to feature an in-ring referee. The referee in the game is fairly accurate. For example, whenever a pinfall is attempted, the referee must run to where the two wrestlers are, lay on his stomach, and begin the three count. In effect, if the referee is on the other side of the ring when an opponent initiates a pin, the player will have additional time to try and escape.

The gameplay was altered for the NES port, particularly in its level design and game controls.<br/><br/>The NES version features three stages, each comprising 20 sections (for a total of 60 sections), which are full-fledged levels in this version, although not all sections need to be visited to complete the game. In contrast to the alphabetical sections in the arcade version, the sections in the NES version are numbered instead. The first stage begins at Section 00, which is the outer perimeter of the space station and then proceeds to enter Section 01, the first actual corridor of the base. At the end of most sections, the player will choose to enter one of two transporters, each taking player to a different section of the base. Some transporters will take the player to a previous section while others cannot be opened until the player has fulfilled a certain condition and will kill the player if they try to enter. The objective of each stage is to destroy the two power generators located at different sections of each stage in order to open the path to the final section of each stage (Sections 19, 39, and 59 in that order) and face the boss.<br/><br/>Instead of using one button to fire and the other to turn around, the player now uses one button to fire at one direction and the other to fire at the opposite. The player starts with a standard-issue laser rifle and can upgrade their weapon into a Flash Buster (which fires medium-range bullets at three directions) or a Megasmasher (which fires wider v-shaped laser beams). Either weapon can be upgraded into the Mega Buster, which provides both, wider-long range shots at three directions. The player can also obtain a Barrier Shield that will protect the player character for 32 shots.<br/><br/>The player also has a numeral indicator which represents their remaining energy, which will gradually be depleted when the player takes damage from enemy bullets or when the player loses a life by touching an enemy. However the player can still continue at the beginning of their current section, even if they lose all of their lives, as long as they still have energy left. When all energy is lost, the player is sent the start of the stage with full energy to start all over. The maximum energy can be increased by destroying the power generators in each stage. The player can also summon as a special transmission shell by pressing both button simultaneously. These includes a Mega Missile, a Flash Ball, and a Crush Ball. Picking these shells and using them will cost the player four energy points.<br/><br/>The Famicom version in Japan was released in Disk Card format for the Family Computer Disk System add-on.

There are only a few battles in history whose names have become so famous as to mean something even to those least interested in military affairs. The epic showdown that ultimately brought down the French empire erected by Napoleon Bonaparte is so well known that it has even entered into common language. Phrases such as &quot;he met his Waterloo&quot; now signify ultimate defeat and the end of all hopes. On June 18, 1815, south of the small Belgian hamlet Waterloo, in what was then the Kingdom of the Netherlands, one of the bloodiest battles of history occurred. Napoleon hoped to destroy the European coalition arrayed against him by means of a quick, decisive victory over one, or preferably both, of his main antagonists. These were the Anglo-Allied army under Field Marshal The Duke of Wellington, and the Prussian army under Generalfeldmarschall Gebhard Leberecht Fuerst Bluecher von Wahlstatt. Admittedly, preparations for the campaign took a couple of months and after its conclusion some more weeks were needed to bring the French empire to its knees, and there were other theaters of war besides the one in Belgium. Yet the Waterloo campaign proper, the just four days between the crossing of the Netherlands border by the Arm&eacute;e du Nord on June 15, 1815, and its disastrous defeat at the hands of the combined Anglo-Allied and Prussian armies on June 18, decided the fate of the emperor, and by implication, the Empire.<br/><br/>Units represent historical regiments, battalions, skirmisher companies and artillery batteries, as well as all major leaders and unit commanders. Players can view units in several different modes, including 3-D &quot;miniatures&quot; style figures or NATO style military symbols. Each map hex is 100 meters across, and each turn averages 15 minutes of real time. Players can select formations for units and employ a wide array of tactics. There are also special rules for light infantry, heavy cavalry and pioneers.<br/><br/>Waterloo contains some sixty scenarios. These include the major actions of the campaign, such as the battles of Quatres Bras and Waterloo itself, as well as several hypothetical actions based on alternative approach marches. Several of these scenarios place the entire French Army against both the Anglo-Allies and the Prussians for one grand battle of annihilation.<br/><br/>Historical Scenarios Covering:<br/><br/>Ligny<br/>Quatre Bras<br/>Soleilmont<br/>Waterloo<br/>Wavre<br/>Twin Battles: Ligny &amp; Quatre Bras<br/>Twin Battles: Waterloo &amp; Wavre<br/>Entire Campaign - single scenario<br/><br/>What If Scenarios Covering:<br/><br/>Braine le Comte<br/>Chatelet<br/>Mons<br/>Nivelles<br/>Plancenoit<br/>The Ridge<br/>Togrinne<br/>And others..<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "78865": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Campaign Jena-Auerstaedt", "videogamemode": {"2410": "Asynchronous Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"56708": "NA Windows Edition"}, "average": "0", "videogameseries": {"6938": "Napoleonic Battles"}, "videogametheme": {"2345": "Historical"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "videogamehonor": {"21166": "2010 Charles S.

Despite being the second game in the series, it is actually the prequel to Gargoyle's Quest (Makai Mura Gaiden: Red Arremer in Japan) for the Game Boy, and features a similar gameplay style, which combined RPG elements with side scrolling action. The game was ported to the Game Boy in 1993 under the name Makai Mura Gaiden: The Demon Darkness. That port was scheduled to be released in North America in July 1993, according to that month's Nintendo Power (#50), but it was cancelled.<br/><br/>Firebrand is a young warrior in training in his hometown of Etruria. One day, while Firebrand is training in a small, alternate dimension, the Black light suddenly appears and destroys his home. When he returns successfully from his training, he is told to hurry to the King by another ghoul just before it dies. Upon defeating Nagus, Firebrand is able to meet with King Morock, who informs Firebrand he is on the brink of death. Before dying, he gives Firebrand the Spectre's Fingernail and Firebrand sets off on a journey to unravel the mystery of the Black light.<br/><br/>The gameplay is almost identical to the previous Gargoyle's Quest game. Traversing the Ghoul Realm is done via an overhead map view while action areas, such as dungeons and bridges, are sidescrolling. A few minor differences between this game and the original Gargoyle's Quest are the lack of random encounters and the addition of the Magic Tornado. Firebrand also moves much faster on the overhead map than he did in the first game.

The game is directly based on Mark Twain's renowned novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and was developed in the role-playing game niche that made Square famous with its acclaimed Final Fantasy series of video games. The game is featured in GameSpy's retrospective overview of the Nintendo Famicom; Benjamin Turner and Christian Nutt's Square column concludes that &quot;one of the most amusing Square games that didn't come [to the U.S.] was Square's Tom Sawyer, an RPG starring the happy-go-lucky boy wonder that featured a...racially insensitive...character.&quot;<br/><br/>Square's Tom Sawyer takes place on the Mississippi River in 1855 the fictional St. Petersburg, Missouri (modeled after Twain's boyhood home of Hannibal, Missouri). The game features the iconic whitewashed buildings from the novel and retains most of the main characters. Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn, Jim, Injun Joe, Aunt Polly, and Sid are all present, although Becky Thatcher is replaced by a girl named &quot;Amy&quot;, possibly Amy Lawrence, Tom's ex-girlfriend. The game centers around Tom's search for treasure.<br/><br/>The presentation of Square's Tom Sawyer only loosely mirrors that of traditional Japanese role-playing games. The game's sidescrolling navigation is less open-ended than most RPGs, while the absence of an overworld map separates it from games like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. The game retains a traditional battle system, where character performance in combat is determined by numerical values for attributes such as health, power, and speed. The values of the characters' attributes increases as the characters gain experience through successive battles. Although Square's Tom Sawyer boasts a large item inventory, it eliminates the system of equipment; players instead fight monsters using their fists.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Square's Tom Sawyer , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78879": {"videogame": {"74295": "Duck Hunt"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Super Mario Bros. / Duck Hunt / World Class Track Meet", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"56732": "US NES Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785801.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "17", "average": "7.61765", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"74295": "Duck Hunt"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785801_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>This compilation cartridge was released in 1988 in a package containing two NES controllers, a Zapper and a Power Pad mat, as well as the game cartridge itself.<br/><br/>"}, "78880": {"videogame": {"78879": "Super Mario Bros. / Duck Hunt / World Class Track Meet"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Stadium Events", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"70696": "JP NES edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic867167.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2369": "Sports - Track & Field"}, "usersrated": "3", "average": "5.25", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4430": "NES"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"78879": "Super Mario Bros. / Duck Hunt / World Class Track Meet"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic867167_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Stadium Events is the English title of the Japanese Family Computer video game Running Stadium (\u30e9\u30f3\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30a2\u30e0 Ranningu Sutajiamu) by Bandai. The game was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan in 1986, in the United States in 1987 and in West Germany and Sweden in 1988. It was one of two games released in North America that were designed and branded for the Family Fun Fitness (FFF) mat as World Class Track Meet. The other game in the Family Trainer series, Athletic World, was released earlier in the same year. Athletic World's label is marked with a green &quot;Series 1&quot;; Stadium Events has an orange &quot;Series 2&quot; badge. This numbering system was abandoned when Nintendo took over further Bandai releases for use with its Power Pad instead. Although there were 10 total games in the Family Trainer series, only these two games were released in North America under the Family Fun Fitness banner. The original box for the FFF mat features screenshots of Stadium Events under the banner &quot;Coming Soon.&quot;<br/><br/>The game featured an Olympic-style Track and Field competition, with events such as the 100m dash, 110m hurdles, long jump, and triple jump. Modes of play include &quot;Tournament&quot; and &quot;The Olympics&quot;. Race opponents are named after animals, the slowest being Turtle and the fastest being Cheetah. Players utilized the Family Fun Fitness mat (Side B) instead of a standard controller in order to run and jump. A controller, connected to Port A, is used to navigate the game's menu.<br/><br/>The North American, or NTSC, version of Stadium Events is universally accepted as the rarest licensed NES game available for purchase in North America. It was recently named #6 on a list of 20 &quot;Holy Grails of Console Gaming&quot;, a list that covered all gaming systems in all countries. The reason for its rarity and subsequent high market price is due to its limited production and sales. At the time of its launch during the holiday season of 1987, Stadium Events was only available in limited stores. In 1988, Nintendo purchased the North American rights to the FFF mat technology and re-released it as the Power Pad.<br/><br/>The two Family Fun Fitness-branded games that had already been released, as well as Bandai's version of the running pad accessory, were pulled from shelves and presumed destroyed. Because of this odd sequence of events, only 2000 copies are believed to have been produced, of which it is estimated that 200 copies reached consumers before being recalled. Today, collectors who follow the online sale of rare video games believe that fewer than 20 complete copies of the game exist, only two of which are known to be factory sealed. An eBay auction of a NES console along with a copy of the game with manual and box landed the seller a winning bid of $13,105 on February 13, 2010.<br/><br/>Another eBay auction on a new, factory-sealed version of the game was sold on February 26, 2010 with a winning bid of $41,300, nearly double the old record. There is currently another copy of the game in near mint condition with accompanying manuals, boxes and flyer that is at $800,200 bidding price, almost twenty-times the previous mark. However, after the auction was ended, it was discovered that the 2 top &quot;buyers&quot; were simply increasing the price for a joke. Since then the seller has relisted the item.<br/><br/>The European version of Stadium Events is not as rare as its American counterpart, but is still an expensive NES game. The PAL version was released in multiple languages so some versions have English wording, while others have German or even Dutch. The game isn't as rare because Nintendo never recalled it like they did with the NTSC version. The value of this game varies depending on the condition of the game, and supply and demand. Prices have been anywhere from $200 (cart only, decent shape, average demand) to $4,000 (NEW in box, high demand).<br/><br/>Even though the PAL version is not as rare as the NTSC version, it is still listed on the Nintendo Age website as follows:<br/><br/>Rarity Level- Cart- 7/10 Rare Box- 8/10 Very Rare Manual- 8/10 Very Rare<br/><br/>Both of the games available in the US for the Family Fun Fitness mat were retooled and relabeled to reflect compatibility with the Power Pad instead. Athletic World's label and manual were changed slightly, replacing Family Fun Fitness verbiage with Power Pad wording. The box for Athletic World was changed completely, making the original box and manual a collector's item. A complete copy of the original Bandai Athletic World game rarely surfaces. Some collectors believe there are less than 500 complete copies of the game. Stadium Events, however, was not similarly modified and re-released, but was instead recalled and distributed under an entirely different title, World Class Track Meet, in late 1988. The games are identical in gameplay and content, except for title changes within the game to reflect the new name.<br/><br/>The re-release, World Class Track Meet was produced and sold in large numbers, as it was a pack-in game for Nintendo's Power Set bundle, which included (among other items) the NES console, Power Pad, and World Class Track Meet. The Family Computer version of Running Stadium was not recalled or otherwise limited, and survives in greater numbers than the North American version.<br/>The Family Fun Fitness pad with the Athletic World pack-in saw a PAL-B release in the Benelux region, Scandinavian region, France, West Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as a PAL-A release in Italy and Australia. Furthermore, the title of the pad was altered to Fitness Center in West Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. There was no official release outside of these countries. Stadium Events was never released in PAL-A format and seems to have only had a small PAL-B release in both West Germany and Sweden. The German and Swedish PAL-B releases, while sharing the same software, varied slightly in packaging. While the box for both releases is identical, each region received a unique manual and cartridge back-label. The German release can be identified by its FRG-coded blue manual and DAS code on the cartridge back-label, whereas the Swedish release can be identified by its SCN-coded yellow manual and SCN code on the cartridge back-label.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Stadium Events , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78881": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Eversion", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"56735": "Windows Downloadable HD edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic846017.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "13", "average": "6.11538", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic846017_t.jpg", "description": "Although apparently a cute platformer, the games's own warning that it is &quot;Unsuitable for children or those of a nervous disposition&quot; should be taken seriously.

It represents the culmination of the Gameboy ports, with a completely original set of enemies, stages, and bosses.<br/><br/>Gameplay is mostly the same as other entries in the franchise.  Players attempt to destroy 8 robot masters, then defeat Dr. Wily himself.  As each boss is destroyed, its special attack is gained for use against future enemies.<br/><br/>This version introduces the Stardroids, mysterious robots from space named after the 9 planets in the solar system.  Their leader, 'Terra', attacks Earth along with the other 8, and MegaMan naturally has to save the day.  Of course, it comes as absolutely no surprise when Dr. Wily is revealed to be the mastermind behind it all.  Mega Man V continues the tradition in the Gameboy series of giving the player only 4 stages to choose from at the start, followed by an intermediate stage, then the next 4, and finally Dr. Wily's fortress stages.<br/><br/>In addition to the 2 Rush adaptors gained along with weapons when defeating specific bosses, the cat Tango can be used as a special weapon.  Like the previous game, there is a shop and currency system for buying items with the 'p-chips' found in stages.  Also like the 4th gameboy title, some stages have secret areas that can be accessed using one of the special weapons.  An interesting note about this game is that it has the only occurrence in the series of another enemy taking the place of Dr. Wily's machines for the final boss fight.<br/><br/>"}, "78900": {"videogame": {"87437": "Hit Pak 6>Pak"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Scooby-Doo", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"56758": "EU C64 Disk Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785020.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2319": "Cartoon"}, "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "average": "0", "videogamefranchise": {"7818": "Hanna-Barbera"}, "videogameplatform": {"4420": "Commodore 64"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"87437": "Hit Pak 6>Pak"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785020_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A simple platforming game starring Scooby-Doo.<br/><br/>"}, "78901": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Karnov", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"70678": "Arcade edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785024.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "21", "average": "5.49762", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"5203": "Amstrad CPC"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"179035": "The In Crowd"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785024_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Karnov (\u30ab\u30eb\u30ce\u30d5 Karunofu) is a 1987 platform arcade game developed and published by Data East. It is the debut of Data East's mascot of the same name. After Data East became defunct due to bankruptcy in 2003, Paon bought the rights to this game, along with a few other Data East games, which Paon is comprised with former Data East staff.<br/><br/>Karnov's full name is Jinborov Karnovski (\u30b8\u30f3\u30dc\u30ed\u30d5\u30fb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ce\u30d5\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc). Karnov, although popularly illustrated as an Eastern European or a Slav, is actually from Central Asia, in what was then the Soviet Union as shown on the original arcade flyer and again in Karnov's Revenge.<br/><br/>Karnov later became Data East's mascot, and was reintroduced in many other Data East games, including Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja in which he played a boss in the first level. Karnov later appeared in 1994 in another one of his own games for the Neo-Geo hardware called Karnov's Revenge. This game, also known as Fighter's History Dynamite, is not a sequel to the original Karnov, but to Fighter's History, a competitive one-on-one fighter in which Karnov was the final boss.<br/><br/>The game puts the bulging-muscled, fire-breathing, ex-circus strongman east-Russian hero on a quest through nine different levels to search for treasures. However, between him and the treasures were several horrendous monsters, including sword wielding monks, djinn, foot hopping giant fish and ostrich-riding skeleton warriors.<br/><br/>Players can make Karnov walk, jump and shoot his way through these levels and find special items that will help him on his way. He also can collect red orbs with which he can upgrade up to three fireballs at a time. Each level contains a variety of strange enemies, such as gargoyles, rock creatures, and strong men, which Karnov must destroy or avoid. When he reaches the end of a level he usually has to face one or more powerful enemies which he must defeat to beat the level and receive a new piece of a treasure map. At the end of the game he must face a powerful boss often called &quot;The Wizard&quot; and collect the treasure.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Karnov , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78902": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Foxx Fights Back", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"56761": "UK C64 Disk Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785431.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2352": "Run-and-gun"}, "videogameplatform": {"4420": "Commodore 64"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785431_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In this game, you play a fox in fox hunting season, but this fox won't just be content with hiding or running, this fox has a gun!

The memories of the dreadful powers hidden within the Ancient Heart, once responsible for deaths of thousands, were beginning to fade. The Papal Court of Ecclesia further discouraged the legends, determining the Ancient Heart to be the work of pure evil, and exiling all who would seek its knowledge.

They called this kingdom Vellond.<br/><br/>Vellend was the first unified kingdom of Dark Elves in the continent's history, and this marked the first time the Dark Elves had been ruled by another race.<br/><br/>Valdemar knew that the dark Elves would revolt unless given a new target for their anger and resentment. Aiming to expand his territory and control the internal disturbance, Valdemar used Vellond to invade Arein and annex Hexter. Arein was an autonomous community of Elves within the Hironeiden territory. The dark Elves' hatred for the Elves made Arein the perfect outlet for their rage.<br/><br/>Before Vellond's appeasement policy, dozens of Ogre and Orc tribes inhabited Hexter, where they coexisted peacefully. Vellond selected an ambitious yet weak tribe from among the Orcs and began supporting it with military supplies. As expected, the tribe began absorbing other tribes within eastern Hexter, and Hexter was soon engulfed in a war between pro-Vellond and anti-Vellond factions.<br/><br/>Vellond's plan seemed to be working perfectly. But even Valdemar could not foresee every possibility. A single detail, overlooked by Vellond, not only foiled the plans of that nation, but plunged the entire continent of Bersia into turmoil.

It was released for several platforms, like C64, ZX Spectrum and Apple II.<br/><br/>In Theatre Europe, after choosing which of 3 difficulty levels, the player can opt to play either NATO or the Warsaw Pact. <br/>The main play screen consists of a rather simple ascii-draw map of Europe, from southern Sweden to northern Italy, and from Great Britain to Russia (Moscow included). Terrain is mostly flat and black, with the exeption for country borders, mountainous terrain and main supply cities. Units are armies (WP) or corps (NATO) and are depicted by discs (full strength) or circles (damaged). Every unit has three stats: ARMament, AIR support and SUPplies. <br/>Gameplay is relatively simple: the game is turn based (IGO-UGO) and each turn cosists of a movement phase, an attack pahse, reinforcement phase and an air phase. The first 3 are pretty self-explanatory, the last phase is the phase in which the player can divide his air force reserve over several missions. Some of these are more or less obligatory (like air superiority), others optional (like Iron Snake, to reduce enemy reinforcements). At the end of the turn, there's the option of using a 'special mission', which, amongst others, can be used to initiate a nuclear strike. <br/>If the player initiates a Strategical Nuclear strike, he's summoned to call 0203 668405 within 30 seconds, to obtain the necessary lauch code. It appeared this was actually a real phone number in Great Britain, contactable 24/7. With the obtained launch code (which is &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;, in case the phone number no longer is in use) the player can select an enemy city and then sit back for a short in-game movie depicting a city, sounding the air attack alarm and after that, the incoming missile and the total destruction of that city, leaving a chilling image of a mushroom  cloud over the ruins.<br/>Normally the use of nuclear attacks provoked a retaliation, with the game ending in an all out nuclear war. On the higher levels, also conventional deep inderdiction strikes or the use of chemical attacks could escalate in a matter of days in a all out nuclear war, thus pushing the message also seen in the 1983 movie 'Wargames's tagline: &quot;The only winning move is not to play&quot;.<br/>The game can however, after some practise, be won by both sides, using a stricty conventional warfare regime.<br/><br/>The game also offered an arcade side: after selecting the attacks, one battle could be selected for arcade play, after which the player had to shoot enemy tanks using rockets in an arcade like fashion. The player performance would influence the outcome of the actual battle. However, upon starting the game, these action sequences could be turned off.<br/><br/>On gb64.com it is claimed that the programmer, Alan Steele, made the game based on any and all info he could get his hands on at the time, including Britain's Ministry of Defence and the Soviet embassy in London. His intent was to &quot;write a war game based on the current situation in Europe, to see what would happen&quot;, so simulate WW-3 strategic combat results as realisticly as possible. Using those stats, the WP would win overwelmingly in a conventional conflict and since it was NATO policy to resort to the nuclear option in case the forces couldn't hold back the WP, the game (and alternate reality, according to his studies) would end in total nuclear war each and every time. In the end, Alan 'fiddled' with the numbers, to make the game winnable for both sides.<br/><br/>"}, "78934": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Flight Commander 2", "videogamemode": {"2410": "Asynchronous Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"108939": "North American PC version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785512.jpg", "videogameseries": {"19336": "Flight Commander"}, "videogametheme": {"2345": "Historical"}, "usersrated": "10", "videogameexpansion": {"79885": "Flight Commander 2: Mission Builder"}, "average": "7.216", "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785512_t.jpg", "description": "From the game box:<br/><br/>Coming up on the heading...IMPACT!<br/>Flight Commander 2 puts YOU in command of the strike force hunting SCUD sites during Operation Desert Storm, or leading a Wild Weasel flight into North Vietnam.

She tells Mike how to solve a cipher that he and his uncle, referred to as Dr. J, found on the side of the Argonians&rsquo; space pod. Mike goes to see Dr. J, and together, they solve the cipher and read it aloud. This causes Mike to be flung into the past. He arrives in the Stone Age. After helping a tribe of cave men retrieve their children from a flesh-eating wild boar, he finds an object, which Mica telepathically identifies as a Tetrad (&quot;Block&quot; in the Virtual Console version). He must travel to different eras throughout Earth&rsquo;s history and retrieve the rest of the Tetrads.<br/><br/>During one time jump, in which Mike helps Sherlock Holmes prevent a robbery at the museum, he discovers that Zoda, the antagonist of the previous game, is alive in Holmes&rsquo; time period, and is also trying to collect the Tetrads. Mike defeats Zoda again and claims the Tetrad that Zoda tried to steal. Based on the fact that Zoda referred to himself as Zoda-X, Holmes deduces that there are likely to be a Zoda-Y and Zoda-Z somewhere in time, as well. This is proven to be true, as Mike later faces and defeats Zoda-Y in Transylvania. After he recovers the last of the Tetrads, Mica contacts Mike and tells him that Zoda-Z has attacked C-Island, where the Argonians are staying. Mike returns to the present and faces Zoda-Z in combat. After finally defeating Zoda, the Chief of C-Island helps Mike put the Tetrads together. When they are together, Hirocon, the leader of the Argonians and Mica&rsquo;s father, appears from the tetrads. He leads the Argonians back to their home planet to rebuild.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarTropics_II' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarTropics_II</a>, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78963": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Avernum 4", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"56909": "Macintosh edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1069636.png", "videogameseries": {"5034": "Avernum"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "5", "average": "7.06", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4729": "Macintosh"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1069636_t.png", "description": "Enormous, epic fantasy role-playing adventure at its finest.

Nevada Smith has no life bar, and is killed instantly when he touches enemies or dangerous objects. Lethal obstacles include pyramid themed traps, such as blocks that fire projectiles when Smith passes in front of them, spears, and pits with spikes below. Navigational challenges include moving platforms and elevators. Bonus points are randomly concealed in some bricks, which are awarded when hit from below. The game contains many dead-ends as 'traps' where you could become permanently stuck, forcing the player to either quit or reload a saved game.<br/><br/>Pharaoh's Tomb was distributed as shareware. The game consists of four episodes, with only the first episode distributed as shareware, and the rest available commercially. There are 20 levels in each episode, each level consisting of a single room.

Most levels require the player to enter a door to advance to the next level, but earlier levels have the player simply move to the opposite side of the screen. The player has the capability to jump and shoot with a gun. This is useful to operate switches which open doors or turn off obstacles. A unique point to this game is that the player has no limit of lives. A player may restart a level as many times as necessary. If a player can collect the letters in the word &quot;MARS&quot; scattered throughout the level in order, a large bonus is added to the player's score.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, Monuments of Mars , available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "78999": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Dark Ages", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"57028": "DOS Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785750.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2328": "Occult"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "6.5", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"189674": "3D Realms Anthology"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic785750_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;Dark Ages is a platform game written for MS-DOS, published by Apogee Software.
