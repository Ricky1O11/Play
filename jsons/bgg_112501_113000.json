It was published by Technos Japan Corp. in Japan and by Tradewest in North America and the PAL region. Super Double Dragon is the fourth console game in the Double Dragon series developed by Technos, following previous titles for the NES, although unlike the NES games, Super Double Dragon is an original title and not based on any preceding arcade version.<br/><br/>As with previous installments of the series, the player takes control of martial artists Billy and Jimmy in their fight against the Shadow Warriors gang. The objective is to proceed through each stage and defeat all enemies, including a boss. The game consists of seven stages, which includes a casino, an airport, a martial arts gym, a fight atop a moving truck, a city slum, a forest, and the hideout of the boss.<br/><br/>In addition to the punch, kick, and jump buttons, the player now has a guard button for blocking attacks. If the player times the guard button right, their character can not only defend against an enemy's punch, they can also put certain enemies in an arm grab, leaving the enemy vulnerable to successive attacks. There's also a &quot;Dragon Power&quot; gauge under the life gauge, which the player can fill by holding down L or R buttons. While the gauge is filling up, the player can perform special attacks which vary depending on how much power the player has accumulated, which includes a flying hurricane kick. If the power gauge is completely filled, then the player's regular attacks will gain extra strength for a limited period. In contrast to previous Double Dragon games, Jimmy Lee (the Player 2 character) has different punching attacks than Billy Lee (Player 1). In the Japanese version, his Roundhouse Kick is also different.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "112656": {"rpgitemversion": {"135530": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Syst\u00e8me D", "rpgproducer": {"53903": "St\u00e9phane de Decker"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1145734.png", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"14710": "Syst\u00e8me D"}, "rpgcategory": {"2083": "Core Rules (min needed to play)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1145734_t.png", "description": "French Introduction<br/>SYST&Egrave;ME D est un jeu de r&ocirc;les simple.

There is an advanced 40 page rulebook for veteran war-gamers and there is also a 4 page quick-start rulebook for newcomers and children.<br/><br/>The game mechanics are based mainly around dice rolling and measuring.

Primarily designed as a solitaire game for sports board game hobbyists, it can also be played head-to-head, with each player making decisions for his team.  It was introduced by PLAAY Games in April of 2010.<br/><br/>The game differs significantly from similarly-themed hockey games in a number of ways.<br/><br/>First, it re-creates hockey action totally differently than existing games like APBA and Strat-O-Matic.  Rather than re-creating a hockey game pass-by-pass and shot-by-shot, HOCKEY BLAST re-creates the action minute-by-minute.  The game charts crystallize each minute's action, and a unique &quot;lull&quot; mechanism allows the gamer to fast-forward past uneventful minutes.  The result is a hockey game that plays quickly, yet captures all the nuances and excitement of real hockey.<br/><br/>Second, HOCKEY BLAST realistically incorporates momentum and fights into the game play. In HOCKEY BLAST, a team plays better when it has momentum.  It can gain momentum in a number of ways--by landing a big hit, scoring a goal, making a spectacular save, or having one of its players win a fight. In other hockey games, fights can occur, but have no real effect on the game other than to send participants to the penalty box.  In HOCKEY BLAST, the classic hockey &quot;enforcer&quot; persona has a real role, just as in real hockey.<br/><br/>Another way HOCKEY BLAST is different is that it provides fans with instructions on how to rate their own players and teams.  The company encourages this, and even posts user-created card sets for free download on its website, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.plaay.com' rel='nofollow'>www.plaay.com</a>.<br/><br/>The game comes in a two-piece labeled box with a game book that contains all the necessary charts, a hockey rink game board, a set of strategy cards, dice, markers for momentum and penalties, an instructions booklet, scoresheets, and two sample teams.  Full player card sets based on historical pro hockey seasons are available, along with a fictional player card series that is updated annually.<br/><br/>"}, "112695": {"poll": {}, "name": "Game of Voyage Round the World", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "1926", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1150708_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1150708.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"135637": "Milton Bradley Airship Cover Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This game is a roll-and-move game with wonderful graphics on the gameboard (world map) and especially interesting for collectors on the box cover: It shows a large Zeppelin waiting to be tossed into its hangar.<br/>It's supposed to be the so called &quot;Reparations - Zeppelin&quot; LZ 126, which obviously inspired the artist to draw this box cover<br/><br/>"}, "112696": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Iron Aces", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"135641": "US Dreamcast edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2514": "Flight"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4421": "Sega Dreamcast"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Iron Aces is a WWII flight simulation video game developed by Marionette and published by Xicat Interactive for the Dreamcast.

When playing a 2 player game, one player assumes the role of the Council of Wardens, trying to defend the city of Salilth from the servants of the Grayking and close four barrier gates within the city. If the four gates are closed or all of the Servant units are defeated, Salilth is saved and the Warden Player wins.<br/><br/>The other player controls the forces of the Grayking trying to overwhelm Salilth and reach the Citadel of the Wardens where they attempt to place 10 Siege Corruption tokens within the Citadel, If they are successful, or can defeat all of the Warden Units, Salilth is lost and the Grayking Player wins.<br/><br/>When playing the solitaire variant, the player assumes the Council of Wardens role.<br/><br/>Needed: one 2-page hex map, 1 rule sheet, 1 unit counter sheet and 1 sheet of nomograph tables.<br/><br/>Setup: The Warden Player places all of their units inside the Citadel, stacked by type.<br/>The player should also take the 4 Barrier Gate tokens, placing them within reach. They then place the marker on the Sparkblades icon on the Spell Rondel.<br/><br/>The Grayking Player divides their units into 6 stacks each with 6 unit counters. These stacks may be configured as desired by the player. They then place one stack on each of the 6 numbered zones outside the city. The player should also take the 10 Siege Corruption Tokens, placing them within reach.<br/><br/>Play: Each round of the game has 4 phases: Movement, Combat, Damage, Siege. Then a new round begins. The Grayking Player always goes first each phase, followed by the Warden Player.<br/><br/>Win: If all 4 gates are closed or all of Servant units are defeated, Salilth is saved and the Warden Player wins. If 10 Siege Corruption tokens are placed in the Citadel or all Warden Units are defeated, the Grayking Player wins.<br/><br/>Solitaire Variant: At game start, randomly sort the Grayking units into the 6 stacks of 6 units each, and place each stack randomly on each of the 6 numbered starting zones. During the Movement Phase, the player will move the Grayking units based on the rules as outlined above. Movement will always occur towards the Citadel and units will always form a larger group if there is a path choice.

Use the listings for Advantages, Disadvantages, and Skills. I put a lot of characteristics under Advantages to simplify the game. This means if the player wants to speak more than one language, be gorgeous and have social status, this is all to be bought as Advantages. Generally, Advantages are purchased at the beginning of the game, Skills are bought throughout the game.<br/>There are no dodge/parry/damage resistance rolls. Instead, the GM should make up (based on their own dice rolls) the details of how a fight goes. If the kids want more specific results for a fight, look at GURPS LITE to add damage, etc. But I advise the GM to use their judgment on damage to speed up fights. This will be heavy on the GM, but lighter on the players. The GM may allow the player to describe the fight depending on the dice rolls.<br/>Shape-shifting can be an Advantage, but Basic Attributes for that shape must be bought-starting from 5, not 10. Then it&rsquo;s another 10pts to add 1 to any Basic Attribute in that shape. I mention this because the first game of BURPS had a boy who wanted to be a<br/>dragon shape-shifter.

Aside from tricky gaming fun, the classic game always provides a pinch of malicious glee whenever a player succeeds in making things difficult for his or her opponents. This is reason enough for Ravensburger Digital to publish the entertaining treasure hunt through the iTunes App Store today as an app for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch.<br/><br/>The journey is the reward<br/><br/>Success and despair often lie close together, but never at the cost of entertainment, when venturing into the changeable labyrinth invented by Prof. Max J. Kobbert. In 2011, Labyrinth celebrates its 25th anniversary. Since the 1980s, the game has been translated into more than 60 languages and has sold more than 13 million copies in its various incarnations. Guaranteeing endless hours of gaming fun, gritted teeth and 100 percent entertainment, the classic has already won multiple awards and given rise to 18 variants of the game (e.g. The Duel, James Cameron's Avatar: Labyrinth, or Junior Labyrinth). Now adapted with much love of detail, the app for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch is the latest addition to the aMAZEing game series.<br/><br/>Digital, but nonetheless aMAZEing<br/><br/>As in the original, up to four players of the Labyrinth app strive to find the treasures before their opponents do - using a single device or playing online! But even if there is no human player available to compete against, it is still possible to battle one's way through the maze. The single player mode provides several challenges: The puzzle mode features 80 exciting puzzles to test the player's concentration, while the time duel calls for quick action. Only those who succeed in both variants will secure first place in the Game Center leaderboards. Thus, Labyrinth fulfills the aim of its inventor more than ever: &quot;to train the graphical thinking of children and adults&quot;. By combining this goal with enormous gaming fun, Labyrinth even made the all-time charts of the top 10 board games. The new app perfectly transfers these achievements to the digital platforms.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "112796": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Cut the Rope: Holiday Gift", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"135906": "iPhone/iPad edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1189572.png", "videogameseries": {"22181": "Cut the Rope"}, "videogametheme": {"2337": "Cute Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogameexpansion": {"85848": "Cut the Rope"}, "average": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2165": "Puzzle"}, "videogameplatform": {"6826": "iPad"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1189572_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>This was a short lived stand alone game built on the same character and concept as Cut the Rope.<br/><br/>"}, "112797": {"poll": {}, "name": "Arithmetic Rummy", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"11505": "Promotional Board Games"}, "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1158963_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7578": {"name": "Kellogg's"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1158963.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"135908": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Game designed to help children with their maths.

It is based on the international level of ice hockey with teams from 1994 as opposed to domestic (intra-national) ice hockey leagues.<br/><br/>There are several gameplay modes that can be chosen from the main menu of the game. These include exhibition mode, playoff mode, and an Olympic mode that is loosely based on the 1994 Winter Olympics. The object of the Olympic mode is to simply win the gold medal while the defeated team receives a silver medal. In order to qualify for the gold medal game, he or she must rank in the top four in either &quot;League A&quot; or &quot;League B&quot; during the round robin format; an X refers to a win while an O refers to a defeat. Achieving this will promote the player's team to a playoff of eight teams that will determine the gold and silver medal recipients. Teams that belong to opposite leagues eventually get to play against each other in the playoff mode.<br/><br/>Periods can either last for one minute, two minutes (60 seconds) or three minutes long (120 seconds). Referees can be set to either real (similar to real international hockey), normal (similar to the NHL), or free (involving a visually challenged referee who only calls for icing). In the real mode, penalties are given for every body check while most body checking is allowed in normal. However, both participants that are involved in a fighting situation are penalized in both normal and real mode. This is offset by using extremely short durations in the penalty box due to the unrealistically low period durations.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Super Hockey '94&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "112823": {"videogame": {"78172": "Neverwinter Nights: Kingmaker"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Neverwinter Nights: Kingmaker (Pack)", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"136016": "UK Windows edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1162453.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4761": "Neverwinter Nights"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "3", "videogameexpansion": {"75220": "Neverwinter Nights (2002)"}, "average": "7.83333", "videogamegenre": {"2155": "RPG"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"78172": "Neverwinter Nights: Kingmaker"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1162453_t.jpg", "description": "Neverwinter Nights: Kingmaker is an expansion pack released for BioWare's Neverwinter Nights which includes three premium modules: Kingmaker, Shadowguard, and Witch's Wake.

The choices are: Laboratory, Garden, Sewer or Factory. There are 12 levels in each stage, each get harder as you go along. There are also hazards for each of the forms you change into: the rubber ball will inflate when it touches spikes, the bowling ball will burn when exposed to fire, the water drop will sink when in liquid, and the cloud can be sucked in by fans.

(\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30d1\u30f3\u30c1\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8!!) is a 1984 arcade game by Nintendo. It is a boxing game with the same gameplay and digitized speech of its arcade precursor, Punch-Out!!. This second game in the Punch-Out!! series introduced recurring video games characters such as Bear Hugger, Dragon Chan, Vodka Drunkenski, Great Tiger and Super Macho Man.<br/><br/>As in the original Punch-Out!!, the player assumes the role of a green-haired boxer, known by three initials, who works through the ranks of the WVBA (World Video Boxing Association). During matches, the player's boxer is viewed from behind as a wireframe (so the opponents can be seen). The player must time his punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer. Hints are given as to the opponent's next move by subtle eye changes (the white of the eyes turn from white to yellow), but the player must ultimately predict what moves the opponent will make and react appropriately.<br/><br/>Once the player defeats the final opponent, the player will win the Heavyweight Belt, then defend it against the same characters that he has already beaten. Each successive time they are met, the opponents are harder and quicker. For each opponent, the player must knock them out within three minutes (three knockdowns guarantees a TKO, although the opponents will sometimes stay down on the first or second one). After the player's second loss, the winning opponent comes forward and taunts the player.<br/><br/>The game is housed in a modified upright cabinet. Like the previous game, it requires two monitors, one atop the other, for the game's display. The top monitor is used to display statistics while the bottom one is the main game display. Apart from this, the game is more or less a standard upright. The game has a joystick and three buttons. Two buttons control left and right punches, one for each arm. One button delivers an uppercut or knockout blow. Unlike the original Punch-Out!!, Super-Punch-Out!! also featured a joystick which could be pulled straight up (almost as if you were trying to yank the joystick out of the machine). Doing so caused your green-haired character to duck, which was crucial in beating certain opponents.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Super Punch-Out!!

On each successive round the opponents are harder and quicker. The player only has one round to land a KO. Technically, there is no TKO element for multiple knockdowns, but the &quot;3 knockdown rule&quot; is utilized nonetheless; no boxer ever gets up from his third knockdown. Additionally, a win by decision is not possible; an automatic loss occurs if time runs out. In the event the player loses, the computer controlled victor will taunt the player and the corner man for the player will try to entice the player to play again (&quot;Come on, stand up and fight!&quot;) via the game's distinctive digitized speech. Players are only allowed one continue per play through. Like many games made during the Golden Age of Arcade Games, there is no actual ending and continuously loops until the player loses.<br/><br/>The game is a modified upright, and was unusual in that it requires two monitors, one atop the other, for the game's display.

Two buttons control left and right punches, one for each arm (denoted by &quot;Left!&quot;, or &quot;Right!&quot; when hitting the head, or &quot;body blow!&quot; when hitting the body with either arm). A large button on the console is pressed to deliver an uppercut or right hook, though the blow can be delivered only if a certain number of normal punches are landed on the opponent, so that the &quot;KO&quot; indicator on the display reads full. When the indicator reads full, it flashes and the corner man's digitized speech encourages the player to either &quot;Put him away!&quot;, or &quot;Knock him out!&quot;.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Punch-Out!!

It is a world that could have happened and then been lost to barbarity and time. Players take on characters that can explore the places involved in the Crusades, from Egypt, through to Damascus and Jerusalem. The Tale-Weaver is their guide, allowing them to unearth the horrors of war and fanaticism as they pursue their goals. As the main characters come across storytellers in their travels, they will take part in a new story within the story of their main narrative. Magic, djinn and foul beasts lurk within the minds of the storytellers, yet many secrets and shards of knowledge can be found within these tales.<br/><br/>And the real world is not free from horror. The land is rife with dark cults, creatures that dwell in unseen places and bloodthirsty warriors. This is a time when anyone&rsquo;s thoughts, from king to slave, are enough to condemn them to death and hell, and many are they that will line up to cheer the execution. Nights of the Crusades is a mixture of the Arabian Nights, the history surrounding the Crusades and both modern and ancient tales of terror.<br/><br/>The rules hope to reflect mature and gritty issues that are not catered to in many popular RPGs, such as the psychological impacts of combat and killing. The gameplay also allows for tension in every form of conflict, whether verbal or physical. A group of companions made up of an artist, diplomat and physician will be as enjoyable to play as one made up of a warrior, archer and thief.<br/><br/>"}, "112857": {"rpgitemversion": {"136126": "HTML Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Mechanoids SW", "rpgproducer": {"24039": "Kevin Flynn"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1150291.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "rpggenre": {"183": "Science Fiction"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1150291_t.jpg", "description": "Introduction<br/>In 2123 the first true nanite was used, it was a medical nanite that cleared the blood system by removing build-ups of hardened materials. It targeted specific materials, it was contained within a specific environment and it had enormous application to a population that had grown steadily older. It was an outstanding success and was quickly brought online to the public. The success triggered an enormous investment into nanite research and a golden age blossomed. By the year 2300 the world was much cleaner, the oceans were recovering with life, the moon had been fully colonised along with a growing orbital presence, plans were afoot to colonise Mars (special nanites were developed to not only terraform the planets eco-system but to allow men to survive better). The average age of a human had grown to over 100 years. Poverty, disease and famine were on the decline. This is the starting point of the Mechanoids. A special branch of nanite research discovered a way to create nanites that could strongly interact with the atomic crystal lattice of metals, with the careful application of energy and force at a molecular level it was possible to give metals a degree of flexibility and resilience that had enormous potential. The result of the research was what became commercially know as 'flexible metals', and more advanced forms evolved into 'living metals' and 'liquid metals'.<br/><br/>"}, "112858": {"rpgitemversion": {"136127": "HTML Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Aegyptus", "rpgproducer": {"24039": "Kevin Flynn"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1150292.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpg": {"286": "Savage Worlds"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1150292_t.jpg", "description": "Introduction<br/>The Great God RA has left us.

They can be opened and closed, although it's typically more difficult to close them. Once seven Seals are open, the game ends immediately, and the player with the highest combat strength (excluding levels) is the winner. The Seal mechanic adds a sense of impending doom to the game, meant to mimic the sense of impending doom for a real apocalypse. It also tends to create situations where the group works together to close a Seal in order to prevent a player from winning via the Seal mechanic. So there is more teamwork than in a regular Munchkin game.<br/><br/>The balance of the deck is also different than the other Munchkin sets. There are a lot more Disaster cards, which are equivalent to traps and curses, so bad things tend to occur more frequently. Also, there are more monsters, especially high-level monsters. To offset this, however, there are more item enhancers and high-bonus items. It's been stated in the Munchkin forums that Munchkin Apocalypse is harder to play and is intended more for seasoned Munchkin veterans.<br/><br/>Munchkin Apocalypse has four new classes but does not have races, powers, or other &quot;thingies&quot;. It includes Undead and Shark monsters, which follow special rules.<br/><br/>The game comes with 180 cards (92 Doors, 76 Treasures, 12 Seals). The Seal cards are a different size than the regular cards--they're square and are shorter but wider (2.75&quot; x 2.75&quot;).

The game was released in North America, Europe, and Japan approximately simultaneously.<br/><br/>There are various types of targets in the game, including air, land and water targets in an environment that gives players permission to freely roam around the battlefield; limited only by the player's fuel supply. Land targets include nuclear power plants (but often include anti-air weapons and tanks); the player may suffer from radiation sickness after destroying nuclear plants when not at a safe distance to do so. The player will eventually need to use one of his/her limited sorties to have it healed; neglecting to do so will have fatal results. Weapons in the game include guns, missiles, electronic jammers, and bombs. Each mission on every war theatre consists of both mandatory and optional targets.<br/><br/>Shooting the optional targets results in the accumulation of a higher score which can double as a respect meter for bragging rights. Furthermore, destroying airfields, although not necessarily required to complete a mission, would stop opposing fighters taking-off to take the player down. In the more advanced missions, players can shoot chemical weapons factories and terrorist camps for bonus points. Although the game cannot be saved through a video game battery, there are a number of passwords the player can use to resume his/her mission at the appropriate place. Crashing the airplane and being killed in action will result in the flags (located at the United Nations building in New York) being lowered to half-mast. Dying in the game will also produce the playing of Taps while the world mourns the deceased pilot.<br/><br/>There is a practice round and then the player is thrown into real-life combat zones in order to test the skills learned in the practice round. Targets become progressively difficult to destroy. Unlike most shooter games, the player only has one plane. If the player crashes, the game is over and a screen indicating the nations (if any) that were reclaimed by the player displays.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Super Strike Eagle&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "112886": {"boardgamedesigner": {"22503": {"name": "Nicholas Fletcher"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cthulhu Zap", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2023": "Co-operative Play"}, "yearpublished": "2011", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"5141": "Cthulhu Mythos"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1165404_t.png", "average": "4.66667", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1165404.png", "boardgameversion": {"136202": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1010": {"name": "Fantasy"}}, "age": "13", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Dark forces are moving.

Trouble brews, however, when a prince of Vecanti named Galgear begins to search for a magical ring. This ring increases his powers, but to the loss of control he could have maintained under its effects, and the gods of Vecanti recognize this and enslave the reckless prince inside a crystal, its mass sinking into the ocean. Fifteen years pass, and Galgear manages to break out of his prison, kidnapping the former heroine Valna and being pursued by troops led by Cham as a result. A member of her band, named Rena Brant, requests permission to infiltrate Galgear's stronghold and free Valna on her own; Cham initially disagrees, but a disembodied voice convinces her to allow this, and Rena brings her twin sister Amu with her. They both succeed in reaching Galgear's inner sanctum, but are stopped by the prince and his ring, who is about to obliterate them when they are teleported away by a magic force&mdash;that of Asfer, the prince's father, who tells them that only the Valis sword, no longer in this world, can stop him. Both girls journey day and night to reach the heavens of Vecanti and claim the sword, which is bequeathed onto them by Y\u016bko herself, sent with her blessings in stopping the power-hungry prince. They return to Vecanti and use the mystic blade to defeat Galgear.<br/><br/>Valis IV is a side-scrolling action platformer. Picking one of three characters (only one character is available in Super Valis IV), the player fights through a 2D level, jumping from platform to platform and battling enemies, before confronting a boss character at each stage's end.

It pits all or part of an American infantry platoon (31 men, 31 counters) against a German platoon (32 men, 32 counters). Each side has one of five possible missions as they enter the board from opposite sides. Upside down placement and blank counters are used to add the fog of war. The terrain includes brush, hills, woods, a creek, a pond and two small buildings, one with several rooms. The men have their separate weapons and also a number of individual differences. Some can see better, some run faster, some are sharp-shooters, and others experts at hand to hand combat. Unfortunately, it is a very unfinished game. The rules are hard to figure out and some are almost impossible to carry out. Things are particularly difficult when fighting develops around the buildings. The game is an offshoot of Terry Griner's Patrol, published as a set of rules in Strategy &amp; Tactics Nr. 7, and reading the rules in that source does help to figure out Move Out. Furthermore, the reproduction of the rules and map is quite poor. There are no counters, only pictures of counters and the pictures are hard to decipher. In spite of its faults however, Move Out offers something unusual and worthwhile for anyone who wants to investigate small unit tactics through a game.

Unlike other core sets, it lacks unique card backs, instead using the standard card back from Munchkin. The included Munchkin-head d6 is yellow with dark red print.<br/><br/>In Munchkin Conan, Robert E. Howard's epic hero gets the full Munchkin treatment. Play a Cimmerian Warrior or a Stygian Wizard! Wield the Sword of the Phoenix and poison your foes with Black Lotus! Slay Thoth-Amon's minions, Pict raiders, and abominable monsters, and hear the lamentations of their women! On many of the cards, the publisher provides context by including relevant quotes from Howard's work.<br/><br/>Munchkin Conan has a new type of card &ndash; birthright &ndash; and the mechanisms are similar to that of classes and races in that you can have only one in play at a time; you may discard a birthright at any time but may play one only on your turn or when you first get it. The Munchkin Conan core set comes with two birthrights: &quot;Noble&quot;, which allows you to have an extra Comrade (see below), and &quot;Barbarian&quot;, which allows you to ignore all &quot;Usable By&quot; and &quot;Not Usable By&quot; restrictions on items. There is no birthright analogue to &quot;Super Munchkin&quot; or &quot;Half-Breed&quot;.<br/><br/>Speaking of races and classes, the races in Munchkin Conan are &quot;Kushite&quot;, &quot;Zamoran&quot;, &quot;Cimmerian&quot;, and &quot;Stygian&quot;; when playing a blender game, they are all considered to be human unless the other sets have non-human races. The classes are &quot;Cleric&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot;, &quot;Warrior&quot;, and &quot;Wizard&quot;, and are identical to the fantasy Munchkin classes with the same names.<br/><br/>The Munchkin Conan hireling is called a Comrade. Comrades fall in the same class as the Hirelings, Minions, Mooks, Sidekicks, etc. that come with other flavors of Munchkin. Each Comrade is associated with a class or birthright, and gives you some of the advantages of that class/birthright. Comrades can carry an item for you, even some that you can't legally use yourself, and their gender matters. They also have the standard Hireling ability to sacrifice themselves to give you an automatic escape when running away.<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"136498": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "average": "6.45", "name": "Munchkin Conan", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "261", "boardgamefamily": {"24": "Munchkin"}}, "112992": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"136500": "North American Game Boy Advance edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2468": "Children's"}, "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5477": "Disney"}, "videogameplatform": {"4423": "Game Boy Advance"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "description": "Box Description:<br/><br/>Twas the fight before Christmas!<br/><br/>Join Santa and his elves to stop Jack Frost from wreaking holiday havoc!<br/><br/>-Battle the icy villain &amp; his frozen followers<br/><br/>-Go on wild sleigh rides to deliver presents<br/><br/>-Race to build toys in time for the holidays<br/><br/>"}, "112993": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Scooby-Doo: Mystery Mayhem (GBA)", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"136501": "North American Game Boy Advance edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2319": "Cartoon"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5935": "Scooby-Doo"}, "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4423": "Game Boy Advance"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "description": "Box Description:<br/><br/>&quot;Relp Rhaggy!&quot;<br/><br/>Mystery Inc. is back to solve a caper of supernatural proportions.

By the first level, Martian Manhunter warns Flash about a robot invasion in Keystone City, led by Gorilla Grodd.<br/><br/>During the second level, Superman and Batman are investigating a break-in at S.T.A.R. Labs and Gotham City is being attack both by regular criminals and robots. There, Flash confronts Killer Frost.<br/><br/>By the third level, the Martian asks Flash to help Themyscira, Wonder Woman's home island, where the sorceress Circe has taken over and turned all the guards into animals, and he's joined by the Green Arrow. Circe slips that Brainiac is behind the plot, but doesn't gives further details.<br/><br/>At this time, the Martian Manhunter is with Superman on Mars, fighting the white martians and Flash talks with Batman. The Dark Knight informs him about some floods across the Pacific, and Flash goes to investigate. Once there, he finds and confronts Zoom.<br/><br/>After this, Flash talks to Black Canary. Brainiac had invaded the Justice League Watchtower and was just driven away. She tells Flash that Superman will meet him up, and Flash challenges him to a race.<br/><br/>Once there, Superman is nowhere to be found, so Flash starts searching for him at Metropolis. Instead of Superman, Flash finds Brainiac, or at least one of his powered avatars. Brainiac mocks Flash, telling him about a bomb programmed to blow up and destroy Metropolis within two minutes, which leaves the player with two minutes to beat the final boss of the game.

They're a Clan of academics, doctors, theologists and scientists always searching for answers to where they fit into the world and how the world fits together.<br/><br/>A large faction of the Clan, enraged at the folly of Cappadocius and full of rage, joined the Sabbat to become the Cappadocian Antitribu, the sorcerous shock troops of the Sabbat. These dark magicians raise zombie armies and rot their enemies alive. They enslave ghosts as spies and agents. The unholy magic of their bloodline is potent and they're all too happy to use it.<br/><br/>The largest Cappadocian bloodline, the Lamia, also survived the Giovanni's attempted coup and played a large part in destroying the upstart Venetians.

Thorson Jr.:<br/><br/>Because of the tremendous support and encouragement from all who contributed to the Rise of the Empire Infinities Sourcebook and those who have perused this volume, Matt and I are pleased to release the second of hopefully five sourcebooks starting with the events in the previously mentioned sourcebook and then continuing into the Rebellion Era. In addition, we are also happy to include Brian Powell to help with springing ideas off of each other, and we hope that this sourcebook measures up to the content and quality of the previous sourcebook.<br/><br/>Matthew Norton:<br/><br/>It is a dark time in the galaxy. The Empire has arisen, the Rebellion is growing, and all out civil war is blossoming. And this is only in the second book! The sequel to our Rise of the Empire Infinities Sourcebook, the Rebellion Era Infinities Sourcebook, has proven to be the most daring book attempted by Thor, Brian and I. Inside is a rich tapestry of galactic life in the galaxy, yet a dark tone hangs over it all. This could not have been accomplished without Brian's and Thor's help. On my Christmas vacation I worked for a week hashing out the timeline, and then we literally examined every line for the next entire month toget the best vision of this dark time to you. And I appreciated Brian's and Thor's help, even if they made me scream on the inside, for they acted as a badly needed counter balance to me. And even though I lost much, much sleep working on this book, I can not be happier with what has been made. You, the Holonet, have been great and I would like to thank all of for your support for our previous book and your support for our current creation. Brian, we butted heads a lot, but you had some of the best ideas in the book. And Thor, thank you again for giving me a place to put my creativity and love for Star Wars into something I am truly honored and humbled to be a part of.<br/><br/>Brian Powell:<br/><br/>In every story there is a start, a finish, and conflict in between. In the tale of putting this sourcebook together, Thor gave us a start, Matt lead us to an ending, and along the way I created plenty of conflict. My contributions to this sourcebook, came a few months after Thor and Matt begun the timeline, so I was poised to see the story from a position of a first time reader, and with my input, together the three of us made the story better. Many hours spent online in chat sessions we tempered the great work of Thor, and made it better, grittier, and larger in scope. To Thor, I wish to express my gratitude for including me in an expanded role in his grand works. To Matt, I wish to express thanks for truly being a great source of powerful ideas which gave me something to live up to during our creation phase. Also would like to thank the Holonet community for giving each of us a home on the web, where we have been honored to share ideas with and participate in numerous projects.<br/><br/>"}, "112591": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1145989.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1086": {"name": "Tony Boydell"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"12697": "Charlie Paull"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"585": {"name": "Surprised Stare Games Ltd"}}, "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1145989_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "This mini-expansion was printed in VERY limited numbers as part of the preparations for Essen Spiel'11 and the launch of the Paperclip Railways Express Edition.<br/><br/>Five extra cards go into the station deck and trigger a Freight phase when drawn - this involves moving cubes around a bit.<br/><br/>The expansion is now available as a print'n play download from the Surprised Stare Games website.<br/><br/>Suprised Stare Games<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"135385": "First edition"}, "name": "Paperclip Railways: Freight Expansion", "playingtime": "45", "average": "6", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1", "expands": {"93400": {"name": "Paperclip Railways"}}, "age": "8"}, "112592": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Riding Hero", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"135393": "Japanese Arcade edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561372.png", "videogametheme": {"2546": "Sports - Motorcycling"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "5", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1561372_t.png", "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>As a young street rider you will go for it all as you go head to head with these experienced proffesionals to win you Class &quot;A&quot; International License enabling you to compete in the famous 8 hour race.

After being hit it's possible for an enemy to experience extreme fatigue, degenerative muscle symptoms, tissue destruction, and a whole host of life threatening conditions.

Note taking materials for player created worlds and characters is suggested if a play set is not used.<br/><br/>Game Play: Each player is dealt a hidden agenda and either creates a character on the fly or uses one from the selected play set.

The game begins with playing one of the dominoes from your hand and creating a scene based on the pips and their matching values for that character.  After the scene, the remaining people at the table can embellish the scene and vote to determine if the player earned the points on the domino and can add it to their score.  Play continues around the table until all the dominoes in hand are used.  At that time, the hidden agendas are revealed and any bonus points are awarded.
