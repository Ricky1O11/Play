Roberts Best Magazine-Published Boardgame Nominee"}, "description": "As 1941 moved from winter into spring, and then into summer, it was becoming increasingly apparent that war was coming to the United States. Most American political and military leaders viewed the Nazi war machine in Europe as the most menacing of all, and fear that US intervention/involvement may come too late grew with each passing month. Most who viewed the escalating conflict in Asia felt that diplomacy and economic sanctions could bring Japanese aggression on that continent to an end, and even if military force was needed, US and western military prowess would make short work of the armed forces from the empire of the Rising Sun. The sudden and devastating attack at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, the devastating air raids in the Philippines the next day, as well as the loss of Great Britain's battleships Repulse and Price of Wales brought the war home in a shocking and horrifying manner.<br/><br/>Despite the pre-war warnings and plans only in the Pacific, the Phillipines, and China there were Americans ready and able to fight the Axis forces. Of those, only a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew who were desperately outnumbered, led by man who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, met with success in the opening weeks of the war.<br/><br/>Chennault's First Fight appears in Against the Odds Magazine #12, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh. Chennault's First Fight covers the Pacific War's opening, when a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew, desperately outnumbered and led by a man (Claire Chennault) who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, found their operations repeatedly crowned with success.<br/><br/>Chennault's First Fight covers the first weeks of war in Burma, from mid-December 1941 to the Fall of Rangoon in early March 1942. The focus of the game is on the aerial battles, but the ground campaign is also covered, albeit on a simpler level.<br/><br/>Air units represent groups of 6 to 8 aircraft, while ground units are mostly brigades and regiments. The area map stretches from the Indian Frontier to French Indochina and from the Himalayas to south of Rangoon. An interactive turn sequence keeps both players hopping. There are two levels of air combat resolution, basic and advanced. The basic level has up to 3 rounds of air combat that are resolved on a &quot;battle board&quot; that also uses area movement. The advanced combat resolution system uses a hex map with more turns, very similar to the classic AH game Richtofen's War.<br/><br/>Air units are differentiated by type. Besides the P-40s flown by the Flying Tigers the Allies take wing with Brewster Buffalos, Hawker Hurricanes, P-36s, SB-2s, and Bristol Blenheims. The Japanese fly Oscar and Nate fighters. The heavy lifting is done by Sally, Ann, and Lily bombers while Dinah recon planes (among the fastest and highest flying prop planes built) lead the way. The Japanese must stike hard and fast and avoid getting sucked into what for them was a side-show. Running up a butcher's bill, or calling in forces badly needed elsewhere in the Emperor's warplan can lead to a lose of face and worse. The Allied player has precious little to waste in this fight, and must make the most of his opponent's weaknesses and mistakes while minimizing his own.<br/><br/>Rules cover enhanced reinforcements for both sides, the Vichy, Aces, Amphibious Assaults, the possible intervention of the Japanese Kido Butai (Carrier Air Units) and weather.

Included are the rules, counters, sheets which allow control of a state, individual named leaders for use as councilors or as generals, tables, expenditure charts and a map of Southern Asia Minor and Northern Syria.<br/><br/>The game begins in the winter of 1100-1101. Each turn represent a season or part of a season. Players write their turns activities, first expenditures and skulduggery, then for<br/>movement and combat. Each winter, taxes are collected and trade deals are made. Any alliances must be thought out carefully, as once trade deals are organized, they can be broken at any time, but not renegotiated until winter.<br/><br/>A state can only run efficiently with an efficient civil service. A player must choose councilors, promoting or dismissing them as the situation requires. Religious leaders, First Citizens, Leading Nobles, and Chief Advisors are real enough, however, and have their own allies and enemies. Attempt to throw out a popular one or keep an<br/>unpopular one, and you risk a revolt which could see you killed by the mob.<br/><br/>Troops of all types are available. Native troops are inexpensive, but few. Mercenaries are plentiful, but expensive. They are listed by the names they are called by contemporaries;<br/>Light Horse are called Skyths by the Byzantines, Turcomen by Muslims, Turcopoles by Christians. Alan Light Horse are also available to Byzantines. There is no qualitative difference. The same goes for Cavalry; you have Ghulams and Cataphracts. Always note the image rather than the name.

It uses two boards to make a double-size 44&quot; x 34&quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon&rsquo;s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening.<br/><br/>From Back of Box<br/>On December 2, 1805, on the battlefield of Austerlitz, an outnumbered French army led by their newly crowned emperor, Napoleon, waited to receive an expected attack by a Russian and Austrian army commanded by the Russian Czar, Alexander. Napoleon lured the Allies into attacking with their left wing, and when the Allies did so, a surprise French counter-attack smashed the Allied right and centre, and then surrounded and destroyed the Allied left in one of the most famous and decisive battles in military history.<br/><br/>Napoleon's Triumph re-creates that historic battle. Befitting its epic subject, Napoleon's Triumph is played on a double-sized 44&quot; x34&quot; map of the battlefield.<br/><br/>In spite of the game's size, it is easy to learn and fast to play. The rules are only nine pages long, and the playing time is only two hours. Napoleon's Triumph is unique among big wargames in that players can learn the game, set it up, and play it to completion in a single evening.<br/><br/>The game system is derived from its award-winning forebear, Bonaparte at Marengo. Like that game, Napoleon's Triumph breaks with almost all of the standard wargame conventions. It has no hex grid and terrain effects chart; terrain effects are designed into the map itself. It has no combat results table; combat is resolved through strength differential. It has no dice; tension comes from limited information and the outcome only depends on the players' decisions.<br/><br/>Napoleon's Triumph is a unique wargame experience. It is large, yet fast-playing. It has simple rules, but deep game play that rewards both boldness of conception and attention to detail. It stays close enough to history to engross wargamers and other students of the period, while still being entertaining enough for even non-wargamers to enjoy.<br/><br/>Napoleon's Triumph is not only easy to learn and fast and exciting to play, it also is a great looking game due to its exceptional component quality.  The map is mounted on a heavy board cut in the German style so that the playing surface is durable, stable, and flat, without the valleys of American-style mounted boards or the buckling of paper boards.<br/><br/>To represent opposing armies, the game comes with 140 wooden blocks, blue for the French and red for the Allies. Painted on each block are symbols that identify the type and strengths of the unit. The senior commanders of the opposing armies are represented by 18 metal flags; stickers are applied to mark the nationality and name of each commander.<br/><br/>In play, Napoleon's Triumph combines the visual appeal of 19th century battle maps and military minatures, with columns and rows of units lined for movement and attack, accented by flags to indicate corps.

China differs from Web of Power in that there is no &quot;half-time&quot; scoring of regions as there is in the earlier game; there are four face-up cards to draw from instead of just two; and all adjacent regions have Emissary scoring opportunities, whereas in Web of Power, some adjacent regions did not. <br/>A special variant with fortifications is included.<br/><br/>Aside from these differences, the two games are essentially the same.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href='http://www.boardgames-online.net' rel='nofollow'>http://www.boardgames-online.net</a> (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>implemented bonus maps: Web of Power, Hellenia, Skandinavia, America, AD 850, Life on Mars, Big in Japan<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Web of Power<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/><br/>    China - Das Duell (Two-player variant)<br/>    China Erweiterung<br/>    China: Grenzstreitigkeiten<br/>    China Einflusskarten<br/>    China: The Embassies<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"25384": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.03103", "name": "China", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "3995", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"9470": "Asian Theme"}}, "18101": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Executive Venture", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1986", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic79144_t.jpg", "average": "3", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4066": {"name": "Executive  Playthings"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic79144.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"97816": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "From the box cover &quot;a humorous game of executive prowess&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "18102": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Toverschoenen", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1996", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic94088_t.jpg", "average": "4.25", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"964": {"name": "Tactic"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic94088.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"188389": "Tactic Dutch Board Illustration Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "&quot;Toverschoenen&quot; is a game in which max. 4 players use action cards (depicting different types of shoes) to travel roads.

The board is built up from segments, each consisting of 7 hexes: one in the middle and six around it. The board can be made quite large, but is usually something like 4x4 segments; the game takes longer as the board gets larger. Each player has pieces of a single color. Pieces can be stacked, but when the stack gets as high as, or higher than, the number of neighbouring hexes, it explodes, spreading one piece to each surrounding hex and destroying the original field. If all seven hexes of a segment have been destroyed, the segment is removed. Thus, during the course of a game the board (Atlantis) disappears into the waves.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to conquer as many free hexes as possible. An area is conquered if it is only touched by hexes without enemy-pieces (compare Go). But beware: Exploding hexes have the nasty tendency to turn into an unstoppable front of explosion and destruction.<br/><br/>As far as I know this game has not been released commercially, but nevertheless it has a large playing community, since the University Game Club (Fanaat) has now more than one generation of offspring players. The game plays best with 2, 3 or 6 players, for symmetry reasons. 4 players is possible, but since the board is not mirror-symmetric the players will not have equivalent starting positions.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"189596": "First edition"}, "name": "Atlantis", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2011": "Modular Board"}, "average": "7.225", "usersrated": "20", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"17514": "Atlantis"}}, "18106": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "average": "4.75", "poll": {}, "name": "Frisko", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "1937", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic79178_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"73785": "Hajo Christoph"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1690": {"name": "The Embossing Company"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic79178.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"162439": "Embossing First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1017": {"name": "Dice"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "&quot;The Roaring Game of the Barbary Coast&quot;<br/><br/>A simple betting game using three dice and wooden &quot;chits&quot; numbered 1 through 6, as well as &quot;Low/High&quot; and &quot;Odd/Even&quot;.<br/><br/>One person plays the &quot;Frisker&quot; (dice roller) while all of the other players bet on the outcome of the roll.

It is one of the few card games played with all cards in a standard 52 card deck that can be dealt out evenly to 2, 3 or 4 players.<br/><br/>Play starts with four cards to each player and four cards to the table.  Each numeral card is counted as its numerical value.  The aim is to capture cards laying on the table by playing a card from hand which matches in number a table card or the sum of several table cards (for example, a 2 and an 8 can be captured by a ten).  Cards can also be stacked, called a &quot;build&quot;, to be taken next turn only if you have that card in your hand to take it later, risking their capture by another opponent (for example, a 2 and an 8 can have a 10 stacked upon it, next turn you can take the pile with another 10 and so can an opponent, capturing four cards).  Face cards are captured by the same face card.<br/><br/>Cards must be played onto the table, called &quot;trailing&quot;, if there is nothing to capture.  Picked up cards are accumulated in a pile to be counted at the end of the round.  Once all players four card hands are depleted four cards are again dealt to each player (only deal the table on the first hand of a deck).  This happens until the deck is spent.  Cards remaining on the table after the deck is spent are won by the last player to capture a card.   Scoring depends on the variant.<br/><br/>Most commonly the points total 11.  Per the rules published at pagat.com the scoring is as follows.<br/><br/>Most cards = 3 points<br/>Most spades = 1 point<br/>10 of Diamonds (&quot;Big Casino&quot;) = 2 points<br/>Deuce of Spades (&quot;Little Casino&quot;) = 1 points (also counted as a spade in Most Spades count)<br/>Each Ace = 1 point (4 points with the Ace of spades counting towards most spades).<br/><br/>A total of 11 points per deck, shuffling the deck again and starting over playing to 21.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Anathema<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"204196": "Public edition"}, "average": "6.27064", "name": "Casino", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "224", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"1439": "Card Games: Card Fishing"}}, "18122": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5404": {"name": "Herb Barents"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Battle of Roark's Drift", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "1978", "usersrated": "20", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic79658_t.jpg", "average": "6.42", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3040": {"name": "Historical Alternatives"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic79658.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"194680": "Historical Alternatives First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "240", "description": "This game on the defensive stand of British soldiers immortalized by the movie &quot;Zulu&quot; has become notorious for misspelling the name of the battle as its title.<br/><br/>Each counter represents one British soldier or five Zulus.

These cards illustrate breeding pairs of 12 of the world's most endangered and rare species of wildlife.  The females have cards with pink backs and the males have blue backs.<br/><br/>The 12 female cards are placed face down on 12 yellow squares in the middle of the board.  The 12 male cards are placed face up on the 12 green squares that surround the female cards.  The playing pieces are placed on the circular brown track, next to one of the corners of the board.<br/><br/>Players take it in  turns to roll the dice and move their playing piece in a clockwise direction around the board.  Once moved the playing piece will be next to one of the male animal cards.  The player attempts to make a pair by turning over one of the female cards and showing it to the other players:<br/>-  If it is a match then the piece is removed and placed face down in one of the three bamboo cages at the entrance to that player's conservation park.  The male is left in place on the board.  Each cage can only hold one female so therefore a player can only collect a maximum of three females without them forming part of a breeding pair.<br/>-  If it is not a match then the card is returned to its original face down position.<br/><br/>When a conservationist lands next to the male of any species they may make their play as for the opening rounds if they have no females in their bamboo cages.  If, however they have a female or females caged at the entrance to their conservation park, and they think that one of them is the mate of the male that they have just landed next to, they may attempt to turn that female face up:<br/>-  If they are correct they remove the male from the playing board and place it with the female face down in the conservation park (not back in the cage).  This breeding pair takes no further part in the game<br/>-  If they choose the wrong female then it is simply turned face down again on the conservation park board.<br/><br/>Unscrupulous conservationists may also &quot;steal&quot; breeding females from other player's conservation parks.  When a player lands alongside a male and they think that one of the other players has its mate in one of their cages then they can attempt to steal it by turning it over:<br/>-  If they are correct then the piece is &quot;stolen&quot; and moved to one of their own cages.<br/>-  If they are wrong, it is returned face down where it came from, and if the erring player has any females in his own cages then one of them is released back to one of the free yellow squares in the middle of the board.<br/><br/>No more than one conservationist can occupy the same space on the outside track, and spaces that are not next to males (i.e. the male has already been claimed) are not counted for movement purposes.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, when all the females have been paired, the player with the greatest number of breeding pairs in their conservation park is the winner.<br/><br/>"}, "18144": {"boardgamedesigner": {"5412": {"name": "Philip N.

Every turn you may ask the player on your left about one location on the Route Card.  This is done by the use of the number cards by:<br/>-  Taking the top card from the number deck and playing one card from what is then a hand of 5 (4 cards remain in the hand).<br/>-  Calling out the top card from the discard pile.<br/>-  Using a Spyglass card to ask about any location on the route.<br/><br/>When a number is called the player to the left checks the route and provides one of the following responses:<br/>-  If the number is on the spy's route then the sighting is &quot;Confirmed&quot;.<br/>-  If the number is adjacent to and in visual contact with the spy's route then the sighting is &quot;Witnessed&quot;.<br/>-  If it is neither of the above then there is &quot;No Sighting&quot;.<br/><br/>Information gained is marked accordingly on a Detector Pad.<br/><br/>At any time during a player's turn a player may try to guess the spy's route.
