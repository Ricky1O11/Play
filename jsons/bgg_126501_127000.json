Once per game, it can force an enemy piece to make a move instead.<br/><br/>Wyrm - moves like a Queen in Chess.  The Wyrm can reincarnate, however - whenever it is captured, a new one hatches from a hatchling (pawn) the next turn.<br/><br/>Berzerker - moves like a Rook except that it can only move to capture. The Berzerker can move twice in one turn, capturing both times. It may capture friendly as well as opposing pieces.<br/><br/>Teleporter - Can teleport to any empty space. It can also swap places with any friendly back-rank piece (i.e., not Hatchlings, Exploders or Guardians).  Can only capture one space orthagonally.<br/><br/>Ranger - Can attack from a distance. This piece can attack diagonally from up to 4 squares away. It will capture the target piece and stay on the square it was in. If it needs to move, it can move diagonally up to 3 spaces, but cannot capture while moving. It can either capture or move, not both.<br/><br/>Flier - Can fly over other pieces. It moves horizontally and vertically and can change direction any number of times (it cannot change directions back the way it came). However, since it must take off and land, it MUST fly exactly three spaces.<br/><br/>Assassin - The Assassin is a sneaky piece. It can move diagonally up to three spaces and change directions any number of times (it cannot change directions back the way it came). It is excellent for getting around obstacles and is a very good mid-board piece since it covers a good area (especially when combined with the Flier).<br/><br/>Marauder - This piece is like a Reflecting Bishop. It can move diagonally any number of squares and reflects off the side of the board. It can also move (without capturing ) one space horizontally or vertically to put itself on a different diagonal.<br/><br/>Possessor - Can move 2 spaces in any direction, diagonally and/or orthagonally.  Instead of capturing a piece, it possesses an enemy piece and the possessor is removed.  It can also dispossess a possessed piece.<br/><br/>Spectre - Moves like a Rook, but it can move through its own pieces (except the Leader and Guardian). A very good defensive piece.<br/><br/>The following pieces are the front row pieces. They may not be possessed or teleport-swapped.<br/><br/>Hatchlings - like Pawns in Chess, except they can move up to three spaces on their first move, not just two. Hatchlings are numbered from one to eight. The lowest-numbered Hatchling still on the board automatically hatches into a Wyrm when that side's Wyrm is captured.<br/><br/>Guardian - The Guardian is the Leader's protector piece. It moves just like a Queen but cannot capture or be captured. Also, no piece can fly over it, through it, etc.<br/><br/>Exploder - The Exploder is the Wyrm's protector piece. It moves on space in any direction (like the Leader) or it can explode. When it does so, it captures every adjacent piece (except Guardians) - including pieces on its own side!

The elements appeared to conspire against the mortals and their heritage, bringing pain, hunger and destruction. And when the end of the human race seemed close at hand, an idea emerged amidst the deserted lands, and breathed hope into the surviving few. An idea of great power shimmering in a man about to fight for his own life. Thus began the era of the warrior; a warrior who, defiant to all, challenged heavens themselves. It was then that the wastelands saw the first Arenas, places endowed with mystic character, where the daring fought to death trying to single out the mightiest of them all. Some claimed that he was to win back gods&rsquo; favor; others that he was to become their equal and finally challenge even them. New habitats started to emerge around the Arenas, suddenly all vibrant with life and ruled, singlehandedly, by a Warlord, the best of the warriors. A Warlord sovereign, drawing passionate gaze of women and envious glances of men. A Warlord supreme, who thanks to his triumphs seemed to put humanity on a pedestal. A Warlord absolute, whose place could be taken by anybody willing to issue a challenge. The Warlord of the Arena.<br/><br/>Warlord of the Arena (W\u0142adca Areny) is a tactical board game that simulates a duel of barbarian heroes.<br/><br/>Players will create a unique warrior by distributing a number of points between six skills. Those skills will determine a warrior's agility, toughness, speed, sword mastery, etc. Warriors created this way will gain access to a vast armory. Various medieval weapons raging from daggers to heavy two handed axes await their test in battle. Throwing knives and crossbows, poisoned blades and big hunting dogs - all of this deadly weaponry varies in dealt damage, weight and special abilities, changing players' strategies for the fight. The strongest of warriors will be able to clad themselves in heavy plate armors, while the weaker ones will have to survive wearing only leather. Once warriors spent all of their gold, the players will build the arena. Even though the Arena is divided in several dangerous spaces, delivering special effects and fighting modification, players will be allowed to bring some extra mayhem to this place. Snakes, deadly spikes and a powerful chained beast wandering all over the arena are waiting to be bought for special points by the players to influence their tactics even further. Once the warriors and the arena are ready the duel begins. Each player can choose from arange of fighting moves (both defensive and offensive) to defeat his opponent. Chance of successful move attempt will be determined by your position on the arena, chosen weapon and position of your opponent. Lure your opponent out to the slippery floor and then jump him from behind to gain advantage ! Players will quickly exchange moves dancing in a sophisticated sword fight, using elements of the environment in order to win. There are 3 ways to win the duel. You can defeat your opponent by dealing one powerful blow which will kill him instantly or several minor ones that will cause him to bleed to his death! You may also poison him, which will cause them to lose consciousness and grant you victory. You can also try to deal a injury so painful that the opponent warrior will surrender, fearing for his life. All this brutal mayhem awaits you in Warlords of the Arena.<br/><br/>"}, "126551": {"poll": [], "name": "Eine Reise durch Sachsen", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2529157_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Spika"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2529157.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Spika GDR edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Dice", "Educational", "Racing", "Travel"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Objective: be the first to travel to arrival point<br/>learn more about folks and country<br/>- simple 'Roll and Move' game, moving by turn -<br/><br/>rolling the die each player starts in Dresden<br/>you can't kick opponents ==&gt; your can't move if you would meet another meeple<br/>follow instructions of field you land on - description/characterization of the place you reached is told<br/>to all participants<br/>remarks: <br/>GDR product, very similar to ==&gt;<br/>Eine Reise durch Sachsen - und Sudetengau<br/><br/>"}, "126553": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Matthew Crichton", "Peter Maynard", "Shane Thomas"], "average": "6.5", "poll": [], "name": "ARK: The Great Race", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory", "Roll / Spin and Move", "Set Collection", "Time Track"], "yearpublished": "2012", "usersrated": "3", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1381545_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Mark Ciccotosto"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Universal Games Pty Ltd"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1381545.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Universal Games First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Children's Game", "Educational", "Memory", "Novel-based", "Religious"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "ARK the Great Race is a Family Board game that can be played from 2 to 6 players. The age group that we have suggested is 8 years and up, however younger children as young as 6 still can grasp the concept of the game. The game consist of 6 Noah figures, large playing board, 336 playing cards, 6 Ark pieces with card holders, 2 card trays and dice.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to collect as many animal pair cards from as many coloured regions in the time allocated. To start the game each player positions his Noah piece and Ark to correspond with the coloured starting icon on the board.  Each player then rolls the dice; the highest roll starts s first. As you move around the game board you will come across 3 different icons; 1. Coloured Region spots, 2. Rainbow spots and 3. Question mark spots.<br/><br/>Landing on any 1 of 7 coloured region spots will entitle you to receive a corresponding coloured animal card. These animal cards consist of male, female and paired animals. Each colourfully illustrated animal card is unique to its region and comes with 3 descriptive facts and animal sound. When you pick up an animal card you must inform the rest of the players what the animal is without revealing its sex. These cards must be collected in pairs and placed in your Ark to be protected. Unpaired cards are placed face down in front of each player until such time the corresponding male or female card is collected.<br/><br/>Rainbow spots are randomly placed around the playing board. Landing upon one of these icons allows the player to receive a Rainbow card. These cards can alter the course of the game in a very exciting way. This card set consists of good cards and not so good cards. The good cards can offer the player protection, extra animal cards and the chance to disadvantage your opponents. The not so good cards can damage your Ark and allow other players a chance to take your animal pairs which are no longer protected by a completed, undamaged Ark. Rainbow cards can dramatically change the outcome of any game in the dying minutes.<br/><br/>Question mark spots allow the player to win other players animal cards by correctly guessing not only the animal card but the correct sex. Guessing correctly also entitles you to another turn. When you land on a question mark spot you can ask any other player 1 question. If you are having difficulty remembering who has what animal card you may chose to ask that player to read any 1 of 3 animal card facts on that card. Remembering other player&rsquo;s animal cards will definitely give you an advantage in game play.<br/><br/>"}, "126554": {"rpgartist": ["Daniel Gorringe"], "rpg": ["Monster of the Week"], "poll": [], "name": "The Chosen", "rpgdesigner": ["Michael Sands"], "rpgproducer": ["Steve Hickey", "Michael Sands"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1342977.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Horror (Supernatural)", "Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["Generic Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Monster of the Week Hunter Playbook"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1342977_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>Your birth was prophesied.

Tendry's Tale is an innovative concept that is not your typical RPG at all, but a puzzle game!<br/><br/>Join Tendry, a member of the Stalwart Army, who is trapped far beneath the surface after battling a menacing Underground Empire. He might not be the ideal warrior, but he's got a lot of panache to make up for his lack in prowess.<br/><br/>What makes DROD RPG different from the typical role-playing experience is that it contains no randomness. Enemy encounters, items, areas and treasures are all carefully designed to bring you a series of engaging, well thought-out puzzles that are a joy to solve. There is no grinding and each area is a completely unique experience. Movement is turn-based, and you may play as quickly or slowly as you want. Play this game to relax and contemplate, or take advantage of its large depth and optional elements of challenge and replayability.<br/><br/>Combining DROD's straight-forward interface and flexible puzzle widgets with the staples of RPG-like play makes for a unique gaming experience. Along with a powerful level editor, online features, and an enthusiastic player community, this is a game you can enjoy for years. <br/>13 interlocking puzzle levels with over 350 rooms, filled with traps, secrets, and surprises. <br/>25 swords, shields and special items to find, each with unique capabilities. <br/>Many other game elements based off DROD's singular puzzle experience. <br/>Dozens of monster types and boss enemies with varying abilities and behavior. <br/>Powerful campaign editor.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "126570": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2641308.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Miguel Jorge"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": ["Miguel Jorge", "Patricia R.

The credits can be applied in the team or teams the player chooses.<br/><br/>To increase the confidence level of their teams and play in more times the dice to win games, each player must manage the trust claims as best they can. Thus, the CC can be invested in two types of resources: players and coaches. Both types are rated as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;outstanding&quot;.<br/><br/>In all matches, the last dice roll made by a player is the one the counts for the final score of the match. For example, if you can throw the dice three times, but if you are satisfied with the 2nd roll, you don't need not make the final one. The latter roll is the one that counts, whether or not the most favorable.<br/><br/>The &quot;home&quot; team may choose to re-roll the final dice of both players, by using the &quot;home factor&quot; card. Once rerolled the results are final.<br/><br/>Each victory is worth 3 points and 4 CC, each tie is worth 1 point and 2 CC and every defeat is worth 0 points and cost one CC.<br/><br/>This increase or decrease of confidence in players and /pr coaches and the gain or loss of CC are accounted at the end of a match day, and before the next match day.<br/><br/>At the end of the group stage, only the two or four best teams from each group (depending on the number of players) advance to the next stage. The tie breakers are: <br/>1st: point gained;<br/>2nd: greatest goal average;<br/>3rd: most goals scored for.<br/>4th: result of the match between the tied teams.<br/><br/>All other teams are eliminated from play at this point.<br/><br/>For each stage a team advances, the controlling player receives 2 CC<br/><br/>The quarter finals (if applicable),  the semi finals and final games are to be elimination games. If they end up tied, they go to penalties, using the &quot;penalty die&quot;. A series of five penalties for each team is rolled, and if the score is still tied, each team roll once until the tie breaks.<br/><br/>The winner of the European football championship is the one whose team win the final of the competition!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "7", "name": "Futedado", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "average": "6", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Football / Soccer"]}, "126571": {"poll": [], "name": "Dynamite Jack", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Linux Downloadable edition", "Macintosh Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1344712.png", "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction"], "usersrated": "10", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Stealth"], "videogameplatform": ["Linux", "Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1344712_t.png", "description": "Dynamite Jack must blast his way to freedom!

Is it more exploration or more shooting?<br/><br/>It's a pretty even balance between exploration/problem solving, and shooting/dungeons. There are no standard fetch quests or the like but the NPCs in the game all play a part in the unfolding of the story. You can open drawers or other furniture in peoples' houses, search things, store your items wherever you like or drop them on the ground-- a full inventory system.<br/><br/>You can interact with most objects, whether they do something or not, and NPCs have conversation trees as well as a day-and-night cycle. The game itself takes place in a fairly &quot;local&quot; area, so exploration is more focused on gradually unlocking new places or connecting them together rather than travelling to whole other towns. There's only one town in the game but it's really detailed.<br/><br/>There is also a keyword system, which is used for trying out secret actions you might have thought of, or mentioning certain key phrases to NPCs. It's definitely not a text adventure game where you have to type very often, but it's super fun to figure out a secret topic to mention to somebody, and hear what they have to say. Typing in keywords is a comparatively minor part of the game, though.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "126574": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Lulu perfect-bound version", "PDF"], "poll": [], "name": "Blood & Bullets", "rpgdesigner": ["Simon Washbourne"], "rpgproducer": ["Simon Washbourne"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1496801.png", "usersrated": "1", "average": "9", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Blood & Bullets"], "rpgpublisher": ["Beyond Belief Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["History (American West)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1496801_t.png", "description": "Publisher's description:<br/><br/>Blood &amp; Bullets: is a role-playing game set in the Wild West.

I jumped at the chance and started writing almost immediately.<br/><br/>Several months later, after much exchanging of emails and several telephone conversations and so on, we had a meeting with B7 Media. They had a draft copy of the rpg and seemed to like our ideas for expanding the system.<br/><br/>However, after the initial excitement everything went quiet. We were aware that there were issues over the licence (for example some of the iconic images were not covered under the licence) but we thought we could get round this. However, it turns out there were internal differences in the company too and one of the main exponents of the rpg left shortly after the meeting. Our little game got lost in the reshuffle.<br/><br/>I have decided to put up the work I did on the rpg as a free download. Whilst it is certainly playable as it stands (my group has played a few sessions), it hasn't been thoroughly playtested and is by no means complete.

The real story focus will be on the player characters and their motivations. Trapped on Mars, working in isolation with the other player characters in the team, stories will pick up on and revolve around a character's personal interactions with his team-members. On rivalries, secrets, hidden agendas, lies and on mutual interests. More than anything, then, scenarios for Outpost Mars will involve very real-world inter-personal story elements. Often, roleplaying games leave inter-character reactions wholly to the imagination of the players.

For experienced roleplayers or ambitious beginners, we recommend the full version of the Story Engine. Translating Story Bones to the Story Engine is easy, though some of the terms and dice rolls are different.<br/><br/>The core of any roleplaying game is the story. Game turns in Maelstrom Storytelling are played out as scenes within the story. Most scenes can be &ldquo;role-played&rdquo; without any rules, but when the outcome is not obvious or a challenge is needed, a handful of dice is rolled to determine the outcome of the scene. Think of each player as an author, and the rules as a tool to allow them to help tell the story of their character.<br/><br/>In essence, the Story rules are about choosing when to spend resources to get additional dice. There is an heroic element to it because the players get to choose WHEN to use their resources, saving them for critical or climactic moments.

It was released in 2000 for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple Macintosh. Terminus won awards in the 1999 Independent Games Festival for &quot;Technical Excellence&quot; and &quot;Innovation in Audio&quot;.<br/><br/>Terminus is outstanding in its implementation of Newtonian laws of motion, which means that objects are subject to inertia. Once accelerated, they float indefinitely into one direction, unless again accelerated into a different direction. This makes steering quite complicated, but mirrors actual behaviour in free space.<br/><br/>In Story mode, the player chooses one of four careers (United Earth League military, Mars Consortium militia, Marauder Pirate Clan, mercenary) and follows Terminus's single-player storyline, set in the year 2197. In 2000, Terminus was unusual among RPGs in that the player's actions can affect the ending of the storyline. Failing a mission, for example, may lead to a different ending than would have occurred if the mission had succeeded. One unique feature of Terminus is the story would progress with or without the player. The player could begin the game in story mode, then go off and do something else and the story missions/battles would still take place, reaching an outcome depending on which side eventually wins.<br/><br/>In Free mode, the player chooses a career and does the same as in Story mode, except there will be no storyline missions. In Gauntlet mode, the player outfits a ship with near-infinite money at their disposal, and faces several waves of attackers, with the object of staying alive for as long as possible.<br/><br/>Support for Terminus has long since ended. Although the game is still licensed by Vicarious Visions, the source code was licensed to the owner of the TerminusPoint website to allow continued development of the game and thus has been improved and enhanced.<br/><br/>In addition to hosting the enhanced version of the game, TerminusPoint also has links to live servers and other community sites.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Terminus (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "126738": {"rpgdesigner": ["Brendan J.

Material has been changed when clarification is needed or unfortunate design decisions were involved.  For example, druid spheres have been altered because important spells were missing for them.

It is a very popular system because of its incredible flexibility and the way in which in encourages player creativity in designing exciting characters. It is the ideal system to use for Star Wars, in my mind, hence this adaption. This adaption is a full, stand-alone set of rules that should require no other rulebooks.<br/><br/>I have done my best to integrate the feeling and mood of Star Wars into the Fate rules as presented here, and have made changes according to my own personal tastes and views on how to use the system. Veterans of the Fate system will notice many small changes, and probably a few large ones as well. As ever, feel free to alter or change them to your tastes so that they produce a better Star Wars game for you. I have consulted and used the rules from several Fate rulesets in making these rules, including Evil Hat's Fate wiki, Strands of Fate, and Cubicle 7's Legends of Anglerre and Starblazer Adventures. You should find and buy all those games and support them.<br/><br/>In regards to the Star Wars setting, I have only included enough material to run the game. This is not a campaign setting book with copious notes about the setting; it is the basic rules needed to play there. There is just enough setting here to make the rules make sense. If you need more background information on the setting, I highly suggest you visit Wookieepedia, the amazing fan-run Star Wars wiki, or consult the dozens of books on the Star Wars Universe (including the RPGs by West End Games and Wizards of the Coast). Enjoy, and may the Force be with you.<br/><br/>By the way, a caveat: I love the Fate rules, but I will always sacrifice some of the simplicity or smoothness to do a better job of reflecting how Star Wars feels to me. As a reader of all the expanded Universe material and a lover of the prequels, that might not jive with everyone's vision of the Saga. I am trying to replicate a more broad and inclusive version of the Saga that uses pretty much all the material, instead of, say, a 3 Original Movies only game, which I concede would probably look different.<br/><br/>"}, "126778": {"rpgdesigner": ["Keith Baker"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "rpgseries": ["Penumbra"], "name": "Crime & Punishment Web Enhancement", "rpgartist": ["J.

Blue pyramids represent Freemasons, who are further initiated into higher degrees by having smaller pyramids stacked on top of them. Small black and white pyramids are nested inside high-degree Masons to show their allegiance to the Rosicrucians or the Illuminati. Yellow and/or orange pyramids are used as money.<br/><br/>During the course of play, number cards are placed on the table to represent Masonic lodges, while face cards represent the rulers of the countries.

After three seasons of scrabbling and foraging, each ant colony faces a harsh winter that will test its colonial strength.<br/><br/>In game terms, each player has an individual game board to track what's going on inside his colony &ndash; that is, whether the nurses are tending to larvae or doing other things, where the larvae are in their growth process, what resources the colony has, which actions are available to workers when they leave the colony, and so on. The shared game board shows the landscape outside the exit tunnel that all colonies share; after exiting this tunnel, workers ants can move over the terrain to place pheromones (which gives them access to resource cubes), clean up empty pheromones (to make space), hunt prey (by discarding soldiers) or place special tiles (but only if they've developed the ant colony).<br/><br/>The game lasts three years, and at the start of each year three season dice are rolled to determine the event for each season: extra larvae or soldiers, more VPs for actions, and so on. Within each season, players can spend larvae to adjust the event for themselves on their personal player board. (Put the kids to work!) After adjusting the event, player allocate nurses to birth larvae, worker or soldier ants or to use them for other actions. The worker ants then do their thing, working within the colony itself (although only one colony level is open initially) or traveling to the outside world to hunt prey (ladybugs, termites, spiders), lay down pheromones (which later lets them claim resources on these spaces), place special tiles (like an aphid farm or sub-colony), or clear out pheromones left by ants from any colony. After harvesting, nurses who didn't tend to births then take additional actions, such as opening a new tunnel that only your colony can use, clearing a new level within your colony, or meeting one of the six objectives (capture a certain number of prey, build special tiles, and so on) laid out at the start of the game.<br/><br/>After three seasons, players must pay food to get their colony through winter, losing points if they can't.

Created by Jerry Stratton, this collection of player written material for FASA&rsquo;s Shadowrun&reg; game was edited by him through issue four. Tony Moller then took over and continues to the present day.<br/>I am neither of those men. I&rsquo;m Lester Ward, usually known as Wordman. I wrote a bunch of this stuff, and frankly, I&rsquo;m tired of looking through six different indexes for it. Hence, this file. This file collects all six volumes into one, connected work. At the same time, I took the liberty of updating statistics and mechanics to Shadowrun: Second Edition, using the stuff that Chris Doherty previously posted, and some common sense of my own. I also took out any and all FASA written stuff I could find, for copyright concerns. If you want to read the FASA stories, you&rsquo;ll have to check the original issues.<br/>FASA and Shadowrun players share an annoying tendency to capitalize Everyting Under the Sun, so I removed most of that as being personally irritating. Lasty, an attempt was made to remove entries that no longer seemed relevant, like references to &lsquo;last issue&rsquo; or rules which have since been superseded.<br/>This document is distributed entirely electronically.

Players take on the role of students of Wizardry to save the Spiral (which is the set of worlds this game takes place in), and battle a variety of creatures by casting spells using a turn-based combat system similar to collectible card. Players advance in the game by accepting quests to learn new spells, gain equipment, and collect gold. The game holds a rating of &quot;Everyone 10+&quot; from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board for crude humor and mild fantasy violence. Although designed for pre-teens, the game appeals to all ages.<br/>At the beginning the player controls a novice wizard, who is named by the player using a set of words at the start of the game. That wizard joins the Ravenwood School of Magical Arts, a school of wizardry located in a fictional town called Wizard City. Instead of the traditional character classes, Wizard101 offers players a choice among seven different &quot;magic schools&quot; (Fire, Ice, Storm, Myth, Life, Death, and Balance) which will influence character development and parts of the magical spells (in form of collectible cards) available to the player in combat.<br/>In Wizard101, the different areas accessible to players are referred to as &quot;worlds&quot;. Upon character creation, only a part of Wizard City (The Commons, Ravenwood, Unicorn Way, Olde Town, Shopping District, Triton Avenue, Golem Court, and a short introduction to the world of Grizzleheim) is opened to access. As the player progresses, more worlds become available. Availability depends on subscriptions and/or the purchase of crowns.

Six to four means he can throw 2 dice and three to one soldiers means he can throw just one die.<br/><br/>Out of the dice he can choose any one as a row number and the other as column number. (means more the number of soldiers he has more choices at his disposal). If the grid on the field selected using this row and column has an enemy soldier, the enemy soldier is removed. If it has the player's own soldier, he can move one square and can capture an enemy soldier if there's one in that square.<br/><br/>If the user threw six, he can use it to destroy an entire row(chose a six and a row number ), or an entire column (chose a six and column number) or a combination of both (when he chose a double six for row and column), killing enemy soldiers and maybe his own soldiers as collateral damage.<br/><br/>"}, "126875": {"videogame": ["I Spy: Spooky Mansion (Wii)", "Ultimate I Spy"], "poll": [], "name": "I Spy Game Pack", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Wii edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["I Spy"], "videogametheme": ["Abstract", "Horror", "Minigame Compilation"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Scholastic Entertainment Inc."], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Scholastic Entertainment Inc."], "videogamecompilation": ["I Spy: Spooky Mansion (Wii)", "Ultimate I Spy"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>I Spy Game Pack is a compilation of I Spy: Spooky Mansion and Ultimate I Spy.<br/><br/>"}, "126876": {"rpgdesigner": ["Keith Ammann", "Daniel Alexander Bruns", "Matt Bunch", "Paul Chamberlain", "Scott Crain", "Erekosse", "Randy Escoto", "Patrick Goodman", "Jonathon K.

Each turn, players roll the dice and move across the board. If players land on an element space, they collect the corresponding Elemental card and place a Totem, which gives them ownership of that space. The more Totems a player has in play, the more chance they have of collecting Elemental Cards from opponents who land on their spaces, and the more cards they get passing their Castle (home base). These Elemental cards are in turn used to cast devious spells on opponents, or help the player in different ways. Elemental cards are also used to create Gems. The first player to collect 7 of each Elemental card they don't represent and use those to create 3 Gems is the winner.<br/><br/>&quot;Omen is the brainchild of Benjamin Conner, an avid board-gamer who works in the Visual Effects Industry.

The target is either suspended in the air or on the ground, which will be agreed upon by the players. A graph paper or grid paper (10x10 or 20x20) represents the playing field. The movement of the projectiles per turn is determined by a standard die roll. Each player has four projectiles to throw. If the projectile hits the target or misses it, it is discarded from the game.<br/><br/>Each move starts with a dice roll. The player moves his projectile according to the dice roll. For each dice roll, the user can choose to move a projectile which is already airborne or introduce a new projectile into the playing field.  For the initial moves the projectile has to travel towards the sky (top of the graph paper) in a diagonal manner (towards top right). After the projectile is airborne, the player can choose whether the projectile has to fall down in this turn. If he chooses so, then the projectile will have to move horizontally for this turn and the next turn onwards the projectile moves towards bottom right(ground) diagonally. The projectile always move to the right and cannot go back. (Should obey laws of gravity and projectile motion). The target is always placed at the second half of the paper, towards the right edge.<br/><br/>If the projectile hits the target the player is awarded 5 points. If the projectile hits another players projectile (lands in the same square) in the second half (right half) of the graph sheet, then 1 point is awarded and the opponent projectile is removed.

Keep them moving. Otherwise they will agonize  over the minute details of the first or second run, and they won't finish in the time allotted. Since most time will be eaten up in planning, NPC's can be used to help them overcome stumbling blocks.<br/><br/>"}, "126930": {"poll": [], "name": "Codename: Kids Next Door \u2013 Operation V.I.D.E.O.G.A.M.E.", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American PlayStation 2 edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["High Voltage"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Global Star Software"], "description": "Box Description:<br/><br/>Play as all five Kids Next Door operatives!<br/><br/>Get ready for an epic showdown!

Each Setting Rule is listed in full below; some of these are optional but strongly recommended for most games. Optional Setting Rules are noted as such in their individual entries.<br/><br/>A Contest of Wills<br/>The Savage World of My Little Pony adds a new system for combat using &lsquo;Clash of Wills&rsquo; attacks that can inflict &lsquo;daunts&rsquo; on your opponents in a similar fashion to attacks and wounds. These are explained in more detail in their own section on Combat as part of the Game Rules chapter.<br/><br/>Critical Failures<br/>Optional; When a character rolls a &lsquo;1&rsquo; on both dice (snake eyes) on a Trait roll, they cannot spend a Benny to re-roll it and are stuck with the critical failure.<br/><br/>Heroes Never Die<br/>Optional; With this rule in play, characters who would normally die are simply knocked out for a dramatically appropriate time instead. Only if the situation is particularly heroic, or if it serves as a major story point can characters actually die. For example, a character who tumbles off of a cliff in the midst of an epic battle with the adventure&rsquo;s villain may catch onto a ledge and pull themselves to safety before blacking out. They are still &lsquo;out&rsquo; for that particular scene as if they had died, but they can eventually climb to safety. Conversely, villains are similarly hard to get rid of permanently and will find ways to escape or come back even after being defeated.<br/><br/>No Power Points<br/>Instead of using Power Points, unicorns simply choose the spell they want to cast and make a Spellcraft roll. The penalty to the roll is specific to the spell itself.<br/>Once cast, check the results below:<br/><br/>     Success: The spell activates as usual.<br/>     Raise: A raise on the roll grants additional bonuses to the spell stated in its description.<br/>     Failure: The spell does not activate.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Backlash- There is no backlash effect if a unicorn rolls a &lsquo;1&rsquo; on their Spellcraft die.<br/>Maintaining Powers- Unicorns can maintain spells as long as desired up to the limit of their duration, but each spell maintained inflicts a &ndash;1 penalty to cast any new spells. You may choose to cancel any number of maintained spells as a free action.<br/>Interrupting Powers- If a unicorn with an activated spell is Shaken or suffers a wound, daunt, or fatigue level, they must make a Smarts roll to maintain all their spells. If the roll is failed, all spells are instantly dropped. Maintained spells shut down automatically if the caster sleeps or is rendered unconscious.<br/>Spell Preparation- A unicorn may prepare a spell by concentrating for a round (no movement or other actions besides free actions and avoid interruption, as described above). If successful, they ignore 2 points of penalties on all spells cast with their next action. If they do not enact any spells on their next action, the preparation is lost.<br/>Cantrips- Cantrips do not normally require a Spellcraft roll to cast successfully (some can have Cast Options if you choose to roll as part of using the cantrip). However, any cantrips that you maintain inflict penalties as if they were maintained spells.<br/><br/>The Tenet Against Violence<br/><br/>Many roleplaying games prominently feature violence as one of the most important tools, if not the most important, at the disposal of the player characters. While this is a perfectly valid path (and makes for some exciting action and adventure) to take in a game, The Savage World of My Little Pony is meant to stay true to the show that created it.

Will you help these villagers to fend off bandits, or will you command the thieves to steal all the rice you can and punish the insolent peasants?<br/><br/>Seven Swords is a game for two players in which one player controls seven samurai and the villagers to try to repel the attack of the evil villains while the other player controls the bandits who try to steal all the rice they can and destroy the village. The game lasts 18 turns, after which the player with the most victory points (VPs) wins. The samurai player begins the game with the VPs in the villagers' houses and rice stores, and the bandit player must attack peasant houses and steal rice to acquire these VPs. The bandit player can also earn extra points if he eliminates the samurai in combat.<br/><br/>Each turns consists of two phases. The bandit, who plays first, has seven cards in hand that symbolize the seven sectors of the village. He discards a card to give himself a number of actions that turn, and he might receive additional actions from the samurai player. With these actions, the bandit can play different bandit troops &ndash; including infantry, archers and cavalry &ndash; with which he can then move around the village and attack the samurai, villagers and rice storage. The samurai player then chooses between five chips &ndash; combat, movement, leadership and two special action chips &ndash; to see how many actions that he has that turn. A samurai can perform three types of actions &ndash; attack, move, and use the villagers to attack bandits &ndash; but only one time for each samurai until one of the special chips has removed the counters of such action. The more actions that the samurai player performs, the more actions the bandit has.<br/><br/>After a certain number of turns, the bandit player discards one of his action cards, then eliminates any samurai who is in the field of the discarded card. Other details in the game include bows that help players attack from a distance and fences that keep the bandits from just walking into the village. In addition to having a double-sided game board with different village layouts, the samurai player establishes the placement of villagers, fences, nows and rice storage at the start of each game, allowing for wide variability in gameplay.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English/Spanish first edition"], "average": "6.67457", "name": "Seven Swords", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Dice Rolling", "Pick-up and Deliver", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "46", "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Japan", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Samurai"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["21 Game Salute - Episode 17"]}, "126942": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1350184.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Colby Dauch"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["John Ariosa", "Gary Simpson"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cube Factory of Ideas", "Plaid Hat Games", "Raven Distribution"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1350184_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "description": "Bellor&rsquo;s Retribution Includes: - 32 Cards<br/><br/>Mountain Vargath Units<br/>1 Bellor - Champion<br/>1 Luka - Champion<br/>1 Varn - Champion<br/>5 Wardens - Common<br/>5 Storm Mages - Common<br/><br/>Swamp Orc Units<br/>1 Murk - Champion<br/>1 Glurp - Champion<br/>1 Splack - Champion<br/>5 Swamp Beasts - Common<br/>5 Conjurers - Common<br/><br/>Mercenary Units<br/>1 Kogar - Champion<br/>5 Rogues - Common<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish first edition"], "average": "8.04736", "name": "Summoner Wars: Bellor's Retribution Reinforcement Pack", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "9", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "208", "boardgamefamily": ["Summoner Wars"]}, "126943": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1545277.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Mr. Bistro", "Colby Dauch"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["John Ariosa", "Gary Simpson"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cube Factory of Ideas", "Plaid Hat Games", "Raven Distribution"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1545277_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "description": "Saella's Precision Includes: - 31 Cards<br/><br/>Filth Units<br/>1 Her - Champion<br/>1 Vomitus - Champion<br/>1 Absorption Mutant<br/>1 Incanter Mutant<br/>1 Spellsucker Mutant<br/>1 Stoneflesh Mutant<br/>1 Void Mutant<br/>5 Anointed - Common<br/><br/>Mercenary Units<br/>1 Saella - Champion<br/>1 Duggle - Champion<br/>1 Rath - Champion<br/>1 Urick - Champion<br/>5 Sword Grounders - Common<br/>5 Bow Grounders - Common<br/>5 Time Mages - Common<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish edition"], "average": "8.17132", "name": "Summoner Wars: Saella's Precision Reinforcement Pack", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "9", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "190", "boardgamefamily": ["Summoner Wars"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode 1 - Mercenaries", "Episode 3 - The Filth"]}, "126944": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1143990.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Dave Chalker"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2011", "maxplayers": "7", "boardgameartist": ["Xavier Collette", "Vincent Poulard", "Gavin Schmitt"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Bombyx", "Mayday Games"], "maxplaytime": "10", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1143990_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Bluffing", "Card Game", "Expansion for Base-game", "Racing"], "description": "Get Bit! is a 2 to 6 player game.

At this scale, a car has 7,5 cm or 3 inches length.<br/>Blitz Bolide is played on tracks which are made of spaces. The average length of a lap is between 40 spaces (fast tracks) and 60 spaces (long tracks).<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY : a car has four levels of gear : low, intermediate, high, and extreme.<br/>Each turn, his driver can increase or decrease this gear by 1 level.<br/>After that, he rolls 2 dice : according to the results of the dice, and according to the gear, the car is moved by a certain number of spaces. <br/>Move bonuses (in terms of spaces) are given by tyres, fuel gauge, suspension, etc...<br/>Once moved, a car can engage another car in order to gain its position.<br/><br/>There are two important difficulties in the game :<br/>a) How to manage the Damage Points (DP) ? <br/>Each car begins the race with 8 DPs. DPs are lost during brutal brakings, during engagement, when the car is going out of track, at extreme gear, etc...<br/>A car is eliminated if it goes under 0 DP.<br/>The higher the speed, the faster you lose DPs. But you cannot win if your speed is too low...Here Pit Stop strategy is very important for purpose of managing DPs.<br/>b) How to take the corners ?<br/>Each corner has an optimal gear. If its gear exceeds the optimal gear while taking a corner, a car can goes out of track (losing speed and possibly DPs). <br/>However, a driver has 3 choices when his car is about to take a bend : short, medium, or long trajectory. With a short trajectory, you go faster, but it's risky. With a long trajectory, you take the corner more easily, but you become an easy target if engaged by opponents...<br/>Here, tyre strategy, set-up (aero grip, suspension, etc..), are very important things for purpose of taking a corner.<br/><br/>Basic rules cover : hard or soft tyres, fuel gauge, pit stop, optimal gear in bend, fast bend, etc...<br/>Advanced rules cover :advanced set-up (pit stop efficiency, bolide's toughness, etc...) defective gearbox, rain tyres, meteo.<br/>Expert rules cover : aero grip, suspension, oversteering, understeering, engine power, qualification lap, Events card.<br/><br/>For the moment, there are 8 tracks : Monaco, Canada, Belgium, Japan, Italy, Catalunya, Singapore, China.<br/><br/>"}, "126972": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1350328.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Sampo Siki\u00f6"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "5", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "45", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1350328_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "Number 12 -- the last -- in a year-long series of monthly releases of expansion maps for the China/Web of Power family of games.

Certain areas of this adventure are extremely dangerous, and so you should decide whether you wish to keep extra NPCs on file for the players to adopt, or whether you want to be liberal in your interpretation of the rules for lingering at death&rsquo;s door and the rules regarding the limitations of resurrection. While this adventure is designed to be difficult, it is not designed to kill parties.<br/><br/>"}}
