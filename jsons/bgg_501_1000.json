You get a sloping rack in the shape of a dragon tail and at the start of the game pick the order for your wind stones on your rack, putting one stone underneath your own dragon at its starting position.<br/><br/>On your turn, you draw the bottom stone from your rack, place it (in the wind direction indicated) next to a dragon on the board, your dragon or another player's, and move the dragon onto your stone.  The stone the dragon had been standing on goes to the top of your rack, to be used again when it rolls down eventually to the bottom.<br/><br/>You make three moves per turn and try to put the other dragons into tough situations while making progress with your own.  So you generally want to play a North stone to move somebody else and the S, SO, and SW stones for your own dragon -- but there are blocks and corners, so this won't always be possible.<br/><br/>The main strategic tip is to try to move the dragons that have been left standing on stones with southward movement so as to get the S stones onto your own rack.  You also have two Storm cards (to allow 5 moves instead of 3 on a turn) and two Lightning cards (to prevent another player trying to move your dragon) to deploy during the course of the game.<br/><br/>Although the structural underpinnings and the slight benefit of memory might make you think you're going to have a serious, thinking game, Goldener Drache actually plays out as very light and take-thatty for a fun 15 minutes and &quot;Let's do it again!&quot;<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"105772": "FX German version 1992"}, "age": "10", "name": "Goldener Drache", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2689": "Action / Movement Programming"}, "average": "5.72656", "usersrated": "96", "boardgamefamily": {"7005": "Animals: Dragons"}}, "506": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic190390.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"61": {"name": "James Ernest"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1998", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"61": "James Ernest"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"12": {"name": "Cheapass Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic190390_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "description": "An auction game in which players bid from their pool of &quot;worker rats&quot; to gain control of corporate projects.

The main object of the game is to get 10 points, mostly by having your mice get food from the refrigerator back into the mouse-hole. The board is the layout of a house with the mouse-hole on one end and the refrigerator on the other end. Your mice try to get food and your cat tries to stop the other team's mice from doing so. There is a dog counter which can be moved each turn, and you use it to try to go after the opponent's cat. In terms of fighting, you can only fight an enemy (The mouse's enemy is the cat, the dog's enemy is the cat, and the cat's enemies are the mice and the dog). You can also pick up items throughout the house that you can use during combat to modify your strength. If you defeat one of your enemies in combat, it is considered &quot;Clobbered&quot; and cannot function until the next turn. Most items give a strength modifier but some items have special effects. In the basic game, you get 4 points for having your mice get a piece of food back to the mouse-hole, and 1 point when your cat clobbers an opponent's mouse.

Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.<br/><br/>After this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points.

Cards come in four basic suits plus a special gray &quot;political power&quot; suit. The cards have values from 5 - 50, with the most cards in the middle of the range. In your turn, you challenge an opponent to a duel in one of the suits. You play a card in any suit (not necessarily the one you are challenging in) , then your opponent plays a card in the same suit. Players can alternately withdraw, or keep going. You then play a different suit - in the same manner, adding up your total score. The suit you challenged in counts double. If the defender withdraws, the challenger places a base (i.e. scores a point) on the defender. If the challenger withdraws, he just finishes his turn without scoring. However, the loser forfeits all cards played (redrawing, but perhaps taking poorer cards), and the winner holds his played cards, and takes the loser's cards into a pool which can score points.<br/><br/>If no one withdraws after all four suits have been played, players may add gray cards in an attempt to take the lead. Ultimately, a player will pass or run out of gray cards, at which point the high score will win the hand.<br/><br/>"}, "536": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic292386.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"245": {"name": "Ron Dubren"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1997", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"245": "Ron Dubren"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"2919": {"name": "Damm / Egmont"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic292386_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"8675": "1997 Spiel des Jahres Recommended"}, "description": "In this funny and dramatic dexterity game 2 teams compete against each other.

Once time has expired, players read through the lists. Any object on multiple lists scores one point for those who wrote it. Any item unique to a single list scores three points.

Players take on the role of biplane pilots and tail gunners dog fighting their way through the gray skies of Europe during the war to end all wars. The game is visually appealing and, like many miniatures games, it was easy to project myself into the scenario. The game is played using 1/72 miniature aircraft mounted on radio antennae with a clear acrylic hex base to hold the whole thing upright. The game board is an aerial view of a WWI battlefield marked off in large hexes.<br/><br/>Pilots and gunners plot out three moves at a time. Each move the pilot chooses from one of eight maneuvers - straight ahead, straight ahead fast, left slip, right slip, right, left, hard right, stall, and Immelman. The slips allow the player to retain their current orientation but slide one hex to the right or left. Ahead fast allows the plane to move two hexes. Ahead, left, right, and hard right allow the plane to change orientation and move one hex in that new direction. An Immelman allows the plane to move forward one hex but completely reverse orientation. A stall allows the plane to stay in its current hex with the current orientation but runs the risk of throwing the plane into a spin. Planes can fly on one of five altitudes. Descent is always possible but planes can generally only ascend when moving forward and trying no wild acrobatics. After movement, pilots may fire on any plane unlucky enough to find itself in their path.<br/><br/>"}, "550": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152337.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"172164": "Dohdles!"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"11": {"name": "Klaus Teuber"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1988", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"779": "Anders Jeppsson"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"404": {"name": "Alga"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152337_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1039": {"name": "Deduction"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"8771": "1988 Spiel des Jahres Winner"}, "description": "Barbarossa, in Italian &quot;red beard&quot; was, according to its inventor, inspired by the fantasy trilogy Die Schule der R&auml;tselmeister (School of the Riddle Masters), in which wizards are devoted to the creation of riddles and riddle solving tournaments.

After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.&quot;<br/><br/>The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.<br/><br/>You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.<br/><br/>Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game.

This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.<br/><br/>Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock, but more on that later. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.<br/><br/>Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.<br/><br/>Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if a route is completely blocked at both ends - seems pretty rare - so getting one end pinched off can be painful (but isn't it always?). All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"25074": "First Edition"}, "name": "Bus", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2007": "Pick-up and Deliver"}, "average": "6.86922", "usersrated": "668", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "age": "14"}, "553": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic918250.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"56342": "Chez Cthulhu"}, "is_expanded_by": {"67655": {"name": "Chez Cthulhu: Cthulhu Mask Promo Card"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"1143": {"name": "Jon Darbro"}}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamecompilation": {"193337": "Chez Geek 1+2"}, "yearpublished": "1999", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"2247": "Alain H.

Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.<br/><br/>Players take turns as follows:<br/>-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)<br/><br/>-Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).<br/><br/>-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.<br/><br/>-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)<br/><br/>-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)<br/><br/>-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.<br/><br/>-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.<br/><br/>The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"41868": "Edge Spanish edition 2006"}, "average": "5.73975", "name": "Chez Geek", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2004": "Set Collection"}, "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "3911", "boardgameaccessory": {"187881": "Chez Geek: Blank Cards"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5498": "Party Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5389": "Chez Geek"}}, "554": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic274350.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"264": {"name": "Gerd Fenchel"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"11902": "Claus Stephan"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"267": {"name": "999 Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic274350_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1029": {"name": "City Building"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"8668": "2000 Spiel des Jahres Recommended"}, "description": "Set in the Italian countryside, this game features various city-states vying for population.

Rarer still are the instances in which these games succeed in presenting a simulation of unparalleled realism in an easily comprehended and playable format. In UP FRONT, we have just such a game. Gone are the hexes and charts of conventional wargames; replaced by innovative and attractive game components which have distilled a wealth of technical data into one of the most playable, yet detail laden formats ever devised.<br/><br/>UP FRONT is a game of man-to-man infantry combat set in WWII Europe and is based loosely on the popular SQUAD LEADER game system. Players need not be familiar with any of the various SQUAD LEADER games or rules to play. The basic theory behind the design remains the same; only the mechanics of play differ. UP FRONT is a far simpler adaptation of SQUAD LEADER principles designed to a card game format. Yet, in many ways, the game is more realistic than its predecessor in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published. There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the &ldquo;hexagons&rdquo; of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.<br/><br/>UP FRONT is a game player&rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, its famous predecessor, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism. That&rsquo;s an unbeatable combination.<br/><br/><br/>UP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult).<br/><br/>Recommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 &amp; up.<br/><br/>Each game includes: <br/><br/>     162 full-colour, quality 2&frac14;&quot; &times; 3 &frac12;&quot; playing cards<br/>     120 full-colour 2&quot; &times; 2.6&quot; infantry cards<br/>     40 full-colour 2.3&quot; &times; 3.1&quot; AFV cards<br/>     304 double-faced .75&quot;, .6&quot;, and .5&quot; counters<br/>     12 scenarios with up to four variations of each<br/>     A plastic card tray<br/>     A 36-page rulebook containing Designer&rsquo;s Notes, Historical T, O &amp; E charts and Campaign Game Rosters.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"23901": "English first edition"}, "average": "7.84312", "name": "Up Front", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2018": "Campaign / Battle Card Driven"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "1896", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "587": {"boardgamedesigner": {"275": {"name": "Hartmut Witt"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Sumera", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "28", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1435_t.jpg", "average": "6.31071", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"174": {"name": "Wittspiel"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1435.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"111519": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "This abstract includes 120 wooden squares, twelve wooden houses and thirty-two human<br/>figures in four colors for a game which is simultaneously about competition and cooperation.<br/><br/>At the start there is a deserted, connected and fruitful land.

Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.<br/><br/>That's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. &quot;I'll back the green horse&quot;) the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.<br/><br/>Eventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).<br/><br/>The constant wait-and-see is agonizing.

The remainder of this gem deck &ndash; with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors &ndash; is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up. Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.<br/><br/>A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.<br/><br/>Players track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card. If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win.<br/><br/>The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game.

Each turn both you and your opponent secretly select one of their respective cards and reveal them simultaneously. The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared.

Then the color would play out, or other players would quash it or play the negative pig, and the game would move on to another color. The effect is like successive waves of popularity being washed out or dashed.<br/><br/>More about the mechanics for those who are interested: On each turn, the player may exchange one stock chip for another or buy one.

Then the player plays as many cards of one color as they like (from zero to five, except zero is not allowed if one has five or the draw pile is empty).

The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.<br/><br/>Players start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player&rsquo;s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.<br/><br/>Players win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player&rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players&rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s card.<br/><br/>Honor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Favor&rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.<br/><br/>A player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent&rsquo;s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have.

That was a time when there were no TV million$, no real passing game as they played with a squashed medicine ball, shoulder padding was a sturdy arrant jumper, helmets were strictly optional and you were expected to play on both offense and defense.<br/><br/>The game features such notable institutions as the Pottsville Maroons, the Dayton Triangles and the Frankford Yellowjackets, and mega stars like Red Grange, George Halas, Jim Thorpe and Paul Robeson.<br/>        <br/>The game works on the old system of pulling a team together, playing a series of games, whacking down some event cards and trying to obtain the best record to win the league.<br/><br/>At the start of the game you are handed some event cards, a league franchise, a team name and, unless you are very unlucky, a handful of star players. You also get some money.   Your core players, the poor faceless grunts in the trenches, are abstracted into a simple team rating and a total salary bill (excellent idea) but the star players, the backs and ends, are each given their own individual card. As team manager, it is your job to balance the huge benefits of having these talented individuals on your staff with the interestingly high salaries they demand for performance.<br/><br/>The three key areas of offense, defense and special teams can all be enhanced by the star cards.<br/><br/>In addition to the player-controlled teams, who will usually play each other twice, the game also supplies a range of 'autopilot' opponents. There are league teams who are often as good, or even better, than the players' lineups and also sandlot teams.<br/><br/>Event cards add a lot to almost any the game. They can be played either before your weekly scheduled game or during the game itself. Their effects are wide ranging; from new gadget plays that can give you an extra dice on offense, to sponsorship deals that enable you to sell out to local government for big money. There are college players, fan loyalty, rain insurance, scams, scandals, intrigue and even subtle stuff like players' agents, loyalty and defections.<br/><br/>Once you have played the game, you work out the gate receipts, which are divided between the home team and the visitors based on a pre-agreed percentage split. There are variables such as number of star players on show, rain, home opener, whether you are playing a winning team, etc. As it is more profitable to be at home (no travel expenses) and to play the winning teams with the most star players, each team has an inherent draw factor - remember this is pre-TV - and can negotiate and earn high income accordingly. Want to play the top rated Canton Bulldogs (8-0-2, three star players) at home? You are going to have to offer their boss a healthy enticement to come to Oolong and perform against your 0-5 Indians, just to earn some money to pay off your overdraft.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, having pocketed your share of the take, you must pay all the players their salaries and if you can't meet the payroll, you will start to lose staff. They may stay on out of the goodness of their hearts, but you also need to apply to the league for a stay of financial execution and avoid bankruptcy. All this links into the league structure. If you have any sort of claim against your opponent you may appeal and have your rival reprimanded or fined, and always at the back of your mind is simply surviving game to game. You must maintain a winning record, you need to find new players to satisfy the butcher's bill of game injuries and, if you survive all that and play nine games well, you'll get a shot at the league title. Interestingly, the game can be won by other means than just having the best record. The team with the most money also gets a point, and a winning season will accrue another. It is unlikely that with a title win you'll lose, but there will be teams close on your tail.<br/><br/>"}, "612": {"boardgamedesigner": {"301": {"name": "Torsten Marold"}}, "average": "5.95617", "poll": {}, "name": "Kippit", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1999", "usersrated": "141", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3539797_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"94857": "Arrnold Reisse"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1280": {"name": "FoxMind"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3539797.png", "boardgameversion": {"90185": "FoxMind English/French/German edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "A game of balance.

Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;<br/><br/>The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).<br/><br/>Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.  Play continues until the point goal is reached.<br/><br/>In the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L.

Typically, dice are used to resolve conflicts between troops, however a deck of battle cards are used instead, which captures the feel of conflict much better and gives approximately the same results seemingly without the bitterness that accompanies skewed die rolls.

They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.  When they have a ship, players draw Playing Cards into their hand.  These cards offer maps for treasures, events to modify a pirate's guns and crews, and other ways to bend the rules of the game.<br/><br/>A pirate's score is reflected by his treasure, which comes from the wealth-laden ships, loot, and hostages in the form of Treasure Cards.  These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.<br/><br/>Some Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.

Roberts Best Tactical Nominee"}, "description": "Starship Troopers is based upon the popular novel of the same name written by the dean of science fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:<br/><br/>&quot;We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.&quot;<br/><br/>Although the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat&mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:<br/><br/>&quot;A suit isn't a spacesuit &mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly&mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.&quot;<br/><br/>With the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as<br/><br/>&quot; . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.&quot;<br/><br/>In early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.<br/><br/>But the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:<br/><br/>&quot;The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ...&quot;<br/><br/>As the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units.  Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.<br/><br/>The game is set up in a &quot;Programmed Instruction&quot; system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. &quot;Flores died on the way up&quot;) to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.<br/><br/>Warfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race.

Units are infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with brigade, division, and army leaders. Each turn is 30 minutes, and each hex represents 1000 ft. Units are basically regiments and batteries. Some infantry regiments with their brigade leader are capable of forming brigades, increasing offensive power at the expense of movement. Batteries can be limbered for increased movement at the expense of firepower, or unlimbered with full firepower and limited movement.<br/><br/>Combat is a modified version of the classic system adopted by the earlier Avalon Hill games.  However, rules for leader command activation, infantry screening of artillery, and infantry forming brigades to prevent soak-off attacks, ranged artillery, rally of losses are give the game a unique flavour.<br/><br/>The major terrain obstacle is Bull Run which provides the Confederate with defensive advantages and hinders Union movement. <br/> The game begins with the Union troops approaching partially hidden, unsuspecting Confederate forces.  As the Union attack develops, additional Confederate leaders and combat units are activated and are rushed to stem the Union advance.  The Union player wins if he is able to capture any of three objective hexes by the end of the game or takes Manassas at any time.  The Confederate player wins if he takes Centreville at any time or prevents the Union player from holding any of objective hexes at the game end.<br/><br/>The game consists of a 32&quot; by 22&quot; mapboard, 260 counters, various charts, a 12 page rulebook and 1 die.<br/><br/><br/>Magazine References:<br/><br/>The GENERAL Index  Article List:<br/><br/><br/>    The GENERAL Vol.20,No.5<br/>        Series Replay - Bull Run, Rex A.

The board shows 36 planets: six clustered together in the center of the board, six more in each of five arms of the galaxy. Planets are connected by &quot;jump lines&quot;: you can jump to an adjacent planet on an orange line, to a planet halfway down a galaxy arm on a purple line, and from one galaxy arm to another via green lines. The length of the jump line also indicates the difficulty of the jump, so to successfully complete an &quot;orange' jump you must roll a 2 or better on a single die, a purple jump requires a 4 or better, and the green jumps necessitate a 6.<br/><br/>As the players scurry about the galaxy, they can pick up and deliver cargoes, which pay both in money and in &quot;Prestige.&quot; These &quot;contracts&quot; vary throughout the game, and only one player can fulfill any given contract. This isn't to say that multiple players can't pick up the named cargo, though. But only the first player to arrive at the contract's destination gets the payoff for a contract; everyone else with the cargo is now just stuck with unwanted junk, and may have to pay a penalty to dump it. Players can also build bases on the various planets as they move around. Building bases earns the players Prestige, and when a player tries to make a jump to a planet with a base, the jump is an automatic success if the player has the owner's permission. Traders obviously have permission to jump to their own bases, but if they want to jump to an opponent's, they will probably have to pay a fee.

These numbers tell you how many dice you will be rolling against each other for each pass.  The attacker is always the first number.  If the attacker rolls a higher number it completes the pass and you go on to the next pass, if the defender rolls a higher number than the attacker the pass was not complete and the action card gets discarded and now the defender draws a Fate or Action card and becomes the attacker.

Often touted as the true beginning of World War II, this 8 year war is the culmination of a decade of aggressive Japanese policy in northern and central China. The game covers the conflict through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.<br/>The Chinese theatre is neither trivial nor inconsequential to the progress and outcome of World War II on a global scale. Over one million soldiers on each side perished. It is estimated that another 7.5 million Chinese civilians died. Over 40 million Chinese were left homeless. The vast majority of Japanese ground combat and support soldiers were engaged in China, preventing their use against the western Allies in the Pacific. America's material dominance may have been the decisive factor contributing to the Japanese demise, but Japan was already doomed to failure in the Chinese quagmire. This is essential to the greater understanding of the war in the Pacific.<br/>Western nations tend to ignore and forget the Chinese contribution to the war effort. It is an indication of western arrogance that World War II is considered to have started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937. The Chinese war effort was far from stellar, but it was enormous. The immensity of the conflict sapped the Japanese war machine to exhaustion.<br/>War of Resistance is a two-player game, with one player representing the military high command of the Japanese forces and their puppet allies, and the other the fractured Chinese military forces. The Japanese player must force the collapse of the Chinese national will to resist. The Chinese player must cling to survival until the entry of the western nations into the Pacific war ensures ultimate victory over the Japanese invaders.

In the &lsquo;olden days&rsquo; (in the game Keydom), these teams specialized in different activities: mining, fishing, forestry, brewing, and farming. With the passing of time, the townsfolk became skilled in each of these activities. They then aspired to gain further skills and experience as churchmen, councillors, and tradesmen. With these new skills came seniority, prestige, and high standing amongst their peers.<br/><br/>In the game, the townsfolk and their seniority are represented by numbered tiles. Keytown is played over four rounds. Each round represents a generation in the lives of the townsfolk, during which the townsfolk may work or study in the resource locations, gain new skills in the church, council, or market, or start a family in a cottage. After four generations, one of these teams is destined to emerge as the new leaders of Keytown. The winner of the game is the player whose townsfolk are collectively held in the most esteem at the end of round four.<br/><br/>Like Keydom, contents include full colour board, printed counters, and wooden cubes.

Each successive business you visit gives you more movement points, but the real goal of the game is to score the most points.  Points are scored by forgoing remaining movement when you arrive at your businesses.  In addition to a scoring pawn, players are each given a police token which can be used to hamper other players' movements.  Players who have completed their circuit wait at the fountain until all players have finished, but finishing quickly gives you a point bonus for each turn you wait.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"147150": "First edition"}, "name": "Palermo", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "average": "5.86765", "usersrated": "68", "boardgamefamily": {"27516": "Cities: Palermo"}}, "788": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic289256.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"34119": "Tales of the Arabian Nights"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"14133": {"name": "Brad Freeman"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1985", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"16468": "Larry Catalano"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"252": {"name": "Edition Erlk\u00f6nig"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic289256_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1022": {"name": "Adventure"}}, "description": "<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        This entry is for the West End Games version and other printings.

They move as far as is permitted by the amount shown on their die roll. Also on each turn, the tomb die is rolled, and one of the tombs is moved.

One of the special spaces is a &quot;Goosebumps&quot; space. On this space, the player draws a Goosebumps card. Some cards require players to perform an action straight away, others allow players to play now or later. One card allows play at any time.<br/><br/>During the game, players attempt to foil each other by picking up cards that allow them to turn other players into monsters, move other players onto bad spaces, steal each other's cards, etc. After a player has been turned into a monster, they can only be cured by landing on a &quot;magic potion&quot; square. If you are unfortunate, you can also fall into one of the open tombs--that character of yours is then stuck there until the end of the game. Characters can fall into tombs only by the movement of the tomb--In other words, they cannot be moved directly into a tomb.<br/><br/>Once a player reaches the crypt, they may attempt to defeat the headless ghost.

Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.<br/><br/>When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew.

In Attila, the players influence the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the Roman empire. The winner is the player who has exerted the best influence on the most successful of the tribes.<br/><br/>Players have a hand of cards which correspond to the invading tribes. A turn consists firstly of playing a card and placing the matching tribal marker onto an area of the board, expanding from their start areas, then secondly either repeating this or increasing their influence in that tribe. If a province now contains 5 tribal markers in total, war breaks out between the tribes. The basic strength of each tribe is the number of markers there, but each player can add matching cards from their hand to boost this. The weakest tribe is eliminated (or rather, all tribes with the lowest total), leaving the province at peace and with no possibility of further tribal markers being added. Scoring occurs four times during the game at the end of each century; the first century ends after one war, the second after a further two and so on. The player with the most influence in each tribe scores 1 point for each tribe marker, the player in second place scores one point per area the tribe is in (thus if there is only one tribal marker of one sort in each area both 1st and 2nd will score the same). The influence a player gains increases in each century, so large swings in control are possible.<br/><br/>Players are thus aiming to expand tribes in which they have the most influence (and conversely, are gaining influence in the tribes they expand) whilst at the same time trying to manipulate the timing and provinces where wars happen with a view to protecting their own favoured tribes and eliminating others. Gameplay is therefore not just about playing out as many of 'your' tribes as you can as you will need matching cards to defend with, and in any case may simply not have the right cards in hand. And sometimes you will want to provoke a conflict, for example by adding a tribe you don't have much influence in to finish an area where one of your favoured tribes is strong.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"26379": "Dutch edition"}, "average": "6.51051", "name": "Attila", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "age": "10", "usersrated": "1487", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5606": "Ancient Rome"}}, "828": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic439210.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"401": {"name": "Thomas J.

The playing area is much larger than say Hannibal, there are lots more forces and generals, and there is a much more complicated political control/strategic will system - as well as quite a few other significant elements.

They may play them:<br/><br/>a) beside a galley to begin amassing provision cards so as to eventually match the provision requirements indicated on the galley. <br/>b) to the discard pile, replacing them with cards chosen from rummaging through the discard pile<br/>c) 'fire a broadside' by playing any card to the discard pile and rolling dice. He may then steal matching provisions placed by the galley by other players.<br/><br/>Once a player assembles all of the necessary provisions, he can attempt to board the ship. He needs to have enough corsairs, to add to the roll of two dice to beat the boarding value of the galley. Other players may also attempt to board the galley at the same time, and the one with the highest boarding value wins it. The others lose all the cards played next to the galley.

Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.<br/><br/>The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.<br/><br/>How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors.

Unlike other leaders in the rebellion, Wallace never betrayed his country, his comrades or his cause.<br/><br/>The Game<br/>SCOTLAND THE BRAVE is based on the opening of the Scottish War for Independence. Beginning with the revolt of a minor land owner named William Wallace in 1297, it culminated in the victory of Robert the Bruce in 1315 at Bannockburn. SCOTLAND THE BRAVE simulates the first two years of the conflict in which William Wallace was the dominant figure. Players take the place of either William Wallace or King Edward of England as each attempts to gain the assistance of Scottish nobles and control of southern Scotland.<br/><br/>SCOTLAND THE BRAVE originally appeared in issue no. 49 of Shadis Magazine. This Avalanche Press Edition features different components, complete with mounted mapsheet, and new rules. This is a fast-playing game which can be learned and played in a single sitting. Battle is a means to an end, with control of the towns the key to winning. Introducing randomness in the form of Strategy Markers adds a bit of spice.

If you don't like the way something is going, you can fight other players for control with your cowboys.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, and shoot those pesky farmers!<br/><br/>Gameplay:  To Start each player receives a set of colored player counters, matching turn order token, and two black action tokens and either $20 or $25 depending on number of players.  The dice are rolled to determine the start player. Each player in turn order will place one of their cowboy counters in a town box of any of the 5 towns on the map until each player has placed 3 cowboys.<br/><br/>Each turn the players will bid for turn order, take actions and move the turn marker one space.  To bid for turn order each player places an amount of money under their turn order token in current player order.  Players may either raise or drop out.  If a player drops out all money bid so far is paid to the bank and their turn order token is placed in the furthest available spot from start player space on the turn order track.  This continues until one player remains and becomes the start player for the round.<br/><br/>During the action phase each player will take 1 action in turn order.  After everyone has taken a turn they repeat the procedure.  The actions available are limited in number so turn order is important in doing what a player wishes to do.  Actions available are: Buy Cattle in a town containing their cowboy(s), Purchase more Cowboys, Move Cowboys to different towns, Move Cattle from one town to another, Purchase Buildings or Transport counters in a town, Take a Farmer(reduces income and victory points from Cattle in the town they are placed), or Gunfight.<br/><br/>There are six different building and transport counters: StageCoach (these earn $1 per cowboy when cowboys are placed in or moved from the town containing the player's StageCoach), Train (this doubles the income gained from all players Cattle in the same town and doubles victory points gained from Cattle at game end),  Bank (earns its owner $2 for each building or transport counter in the same town), Store (earns the owner $1 for each Cattle counter belonging to other players in the town and $2 per Farmer counter in town),  Hotel (earns $1 for each cowboy belonging to other players in same town), Jail (the sheriff in the Jail acts as an extra cowboy controlled by owner that can be added to Gunfights). Cattle and Farmers also earn money for players during an income round.  Each Cattle counter earns its owner $2 UNLESS the town also contains a Farmer (it only earns $1 if this is the case).  Oh, the Farmer and Cowmen can't be friends.<br/><br/>Gunfights can be started to take over another players Building or Tranport counter, rustle Cattle, rob a Bank or remove a Farmer or Jail.  The player choosing the Gunfight selects the target of the attack.  All Cowboys belonging to each player in the town will be involved.  The remaining player's Cowboys in the town are not involved. However; the owner of the Jail can choose to help themselves, if they are attacking, or they can add the Sheriff to the defender if wished.  Farmers that are attacked defend as a single cowboy.  Banks and Trains both have an intrinsic 1 Cowboy defense in addition to those in town of owner's color.  The player with the fewest Cowboys fires first and immediately removes casualties.  Each 5 or 6 rolled kills a Cowboy.  If the number of Cowboys is tied then firing is simultaneous.  A player may retreat instead of firing by moving each cowboy involved to a different town (only 1 per town) and loses the engagement.  If the attacker wins they take control of the target of the attack and may replace the counter (up to 2 counters if rustling Cattle) with one of their color (except for Banks, Farmers and Jails).  A Jail or Farmer is removed from play and a Bank is robbed.  The successful robber rolls 3 die 6 and takes that amount of money from the owner of the Bank (the Bank remains under owner's control).  If the owner of the Bank cannot pay the full amount (then pays all they have to the robber and the Bank is removed).  Each time a player wins a Gunfight they take a Wanted Counter.  If none remain they take it from another player their of choice.<br/><br/>Victory:  After taking turns 3,6,9 and 12 income is paid to players as delineated above.  The game ends after round 12.  Victory points are awarded for each Building or Transport counter (1 point per size of town).  So a building in a Town with 4 Building or Transport Counters including itself is worth 4 points to the owning player.  Each Cattle Counter is worth one victory point for the owner.  If a train is in the town each Cattle Counter is worth 2 points.  If a Farmer is in the town Cattle are worth 1 victory point less.  To illustrate, if a Farmer is in same town Cattle counters are worthless unless a Train is also present in the town.  In this case, they would be worth 1 point each.  The player with the most Building/Transport counters and Cattle in a town is considered to control the town and scores bonus points equal to the size of the town (Cattle do not affect town size but do affect control).  The Player with most money gains 5 victory points (2 each in case of a tie).  The Player with the most Wanted counters scores 4 victory points.  The player with most Points wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"21363": "Warfrog edition"}, "name": "Way Out West", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": {"2002": "Tile Placement"}, "average": "6.16953", "usersrated": "641", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "age": "12"}, "886": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1146051.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": {"997": "Canaletto"}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"132": {"name": "G\u00fcnter Cornett"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "1996", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": {"12958": "Sabine Mielke"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"81": {"name": "Bambus Spieleverlag"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1146051_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "description": "A tactical bidding game.<br/><br/>The highest bid determines not only the purchase price, but also which object will be sold next.

Play is accomplished on a dual-action board game, with movement of Jetliners on the peripheral Treasure Runway, which dictate the movement of Treasure Seekers and Treasure Couriers along the Treasure Routes on the world map in the center of the board. When a Seeker reaches a Destination Foreign City (New York to Johannesburg for Diamonds), a suitcase which is color coded to the Treasure Route (Orange for Major Routes, Gold for Minor Routes, and Grape for Short Routes) is attached to the base of the Seeker, which becomes a Treasure Courier.  The Courier then returns the Treasure (in the suitcase!) to the U.S. City of Embarkation.  When the Courier reaches the Customs 12 Mile Limit it can't move without declaring the treasure or making a smuggle attempt.  SMUGGLE cards are collected to facilitate the smuggle attempts.  Yin Yang Cards bring good fortune or bad fortune along the way. Each game has different dynamics.  Gals can square off against the guys and youngsters like to beat up on the adults!  There is interaction of players all along the Treasure Routes.  All players are in the game until it is over.  The play builds in excitement until the game-winning treasure is smuggled.

Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>The game changes the base game in three main ways:<br/><br/>First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.<br/><br/>Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)<br/><br/>Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded.

Sadly, dastardly grave robbers plundered the tomb and the valuable gems which comprised the necklace were scattered across the globe. Now, a wealthy sheik is anxious to reassemble the necklace and present it as a gift to his lovely bride. Players are charged with the task of assisting the sheik, attempting to purchase the many gems at auction and then reassemble the necklace in the proper fashion.<br/><br/>The board depicts the frame of the necklace, with space for its 36 missing gems. In total, there are 44 gems in the deck, many of which will ultimately prove to be forgeries. Depending upon the number of players, each player receives from 3 - 7 gems to begin the game, along with $20,000. Four gems are revealed from the remainder of the deck and positioned into the frame.<br/><br/>The game is played in two major phases. During the first phase, players alternate placing a gem up for auction, ala Modern Art. The auctioneer receives the funds from the high bidder, who receives the gem. The winner has the option of keeping the gem, or placing it into the frame. If placed in the frame, the gem earns $2,000 for other gems it touches and those radiating from it in straight lines, including itself. During phase 2, the reward is reduced to only $1,000 per gem.<br/><br/>Following an auction, the auctioneer has the opportunity to purchase another gem from the deck for $2,000.  <br/>Phase 1 ends when the gem deck expires. Phase 2 then begins with players reconstructing the necklace. In turn, each player places a gem into the frame and earns funds as described above.<br/><br/>The twist in the game are the rules which must be followed in reconstructing the necklace. The main rules are:<br/><br/><br/>     The necklace must be symmetrical, with left and right halves containing the same jewels in the same places. All cards appear twice in the game, so what appears on the left side must appear in the same position on the right side. The only exception to this is the center column. Any duplicate pieces are considered forgeries and are worthless. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Pieces of jewelry containing the same type of gem must be placed in uniform columns.

Along with the units are a number of expansion kits, which introduce extra money, trains, tiles, companies, and phases. There are currently three, and will be four regional kits, which cover areas of England, Scotland and Wales not included in the three base units.<br/><br/>The rules are largely 1829 with improvements. Survey parties are now optional, and track is built in much the same way as most other 18xx titles. The stock market is largely the same, but multiple leaps up the market are allowed if dividends are high enough. Trains can now run to, but not through tokened out stations, and company shares become available in &quot;bands&quot; of the same value. All shares in each band become available when one of the companies in the previous band is sold out.<br/><br/>Play time varies enormously, depending on how much of the game you play. A single unit on its own will last 1 1/2 to 3 hours, and accommodate 2-4 or so players. Multiple units and expansions add to both the number of players and the playing time. Two units and all the expansions should accommodate 3-6 players (7 max. officially) and last for anything from 4 to 8 hours.

The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.<br/><br/>After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.<br/><br/>On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.<br/><br/>When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"73977": "3M English Dark Gray edition"}, "average": "6.57743", "name": "Twixt", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2081": "Route/Network Building"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "2027", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"4891": "3M Bookshelf Series"}}, "950": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic50505.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"429": {"name": "Frank Branham"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"55996": "Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"206": {"name": "Jolly Roger Games"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic50505_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "From the designer Frank Branham: A 4 player partnership trick taking game themed around the Mexican Day of the Dead. (A particular favorite holiday of ours, as Sandi and I were married on that day in Marietta Confederate Cemetery.) It is short (about 30 minutes), and rather brain bending.<br/><br/>Dia De Los Muertos (Days Of The Dead) is played over three days as you send animals, then children, then adults on to the afterlife. It is a basic trick taking game, except that most cards have an action with them. You play as a partnership, and if your side wins scoring cards (the dead or food), you exchange a card with your opponent. Other cards allow swaps between partners, asking a question, cancelling other cards and so on.<br/><br/>The first time you play, there's a lot of checking the rules, checking the crib sheet, remembering if you exchange cards. You spend more time figuring the game than playing the tricks. But after a couple of hands, it makes sense and you switch to game-playing mode. And here's where it pays. If you enjoy Bridge, can figure out what you partner signals when they swap a card, can read the deck based on what's been played, you will really enjoy Dia De Loa Muertos. If you don't like Bridge, or can't figure trick-taking games anyway, steer well clear. Rather brain-bending it is.<br/><br/>The original game has nice native graphics of the dead abroad and has a variant for 3 players. The re-issue as Four Dragons has an oriental theme.<br/><br/>Not to be confused with:<br/><br/>     Dia de los Muertos (2007)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"54570": "Jolly Roger edition"}, "average": "6.62237", "name": "Four Dragons", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2019": "Partnerships"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "395", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"9470": "Asian Theme"}}, "951": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1577846.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"589": {"name": "Thomas N.

The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line &quot;goal line stand&quot; to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for &quot;long gains&quot;, the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.<br/><br/>Each play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.<br/><br/>For variety, three types of offense (&quot;pro style&quot;, &quot;aerial game&quot; and &quot;ball control&quot;) are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.<br/><br/>Simple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the &quot;More Information&quot; screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.<br/><br/>For those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations. He reached the finals but, in a victory for human intuition over number crunching, lost the championship game by a touchdown and a field goal.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"93516": "Avalon Hill Edition 1962"}, "name": "Football Strategy", "playingtime": "150", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "average": "6.3792", "usersrated": "376", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5640": "Sports: American Football / Gridiron"}}, "954": {"boardgamedesigner": {"9": {"name": "Alan R.

Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.

The game board shows a circuit course of 12 smaller circles. Before each round, the players distribute 6 pawns on the course. One player then rolls all 6 dice and turns over the timer. Players now assign the dice to the pawns and try to determine the highest score possible. The player announcing the highest number before the timer runs out performs his move.<br/><br/>Each pawn moves, in clockwise order, the number of spaces shown on it assigned die and scores 1 point for each pawn on the space it ends its move. If the player managed to meet or exceed his/her predicted number, the player receives a chip from every other player; if not, the player gives a chip to each player and sits out the next round.<br/><br/>The game ends after a player ends up without chips, with twice the original number of chips, or after a predefined number of turns or a set amount of time.<br/><br/>Corona was published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Moonstar<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"73724": "Frankh Spiele Galerie edition"}, "average": "6.675", "name": "Corona", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "36", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"81": "Ravensburger Casino Series"}}}
