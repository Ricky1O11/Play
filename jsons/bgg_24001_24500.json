The first player to get all of his pieces off his home board is the winner.  Unlike normal backgammon, however, there are no safe spaces.  When your piece(es) land(s) in the same space as an opponent's piece(es), they do battle (rolling dice and comparing the result against a defense factor) until one side controls the space and the other (or both) has been sent back to the bar. In addition, one of the pieces has a special power (the Summoner) that really changes the flow of Backgammon.<br/><br/>The advanced game includes fortifications which further complicate things.<br/><br/>The version available in the Winter 2006 edition of the Crusader must be glued down and then cut out before play.

Meanwhile, a player should consider minimizing the total score that an opponent attempts to obtain. Simino is the name of the best move in the game. A Simino move is played if a player places all of his/her four cards all at once on the Simino board during his/her turn in the game. Actually, a player can only place one card at a time during his/her turn. But if s/he can make a Simino move, then it is possible for him/her to place all of the cards s/he has at once.<br/>There are two groups of cards in Simino: Regular and Joker. A regular card can have a single color at each side, where as a Joker card can contain one side having two to four colors and the rest having a single color. Each side has a score associated with them.<br/><br/>"}, "24172": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Flip Flop Faces", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2060": "Pattern Recognition"}, "yearpublished": "2001", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"5607": "3D Games"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic131733_t.jpg", "average": "5.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"420": {"name": "Discovery Toys"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic131733.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"102254": "Discovery Toys Edition 2000"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "From DrToy.com<br/><br/>&quot;This is a combination bean bag toss and silly faces that become targets that flip when you hit them the right way.

Cards for &quot;tricks&quot; may come from the player's personal storage area (which may hold up to 3 cards), the top of the Sphinx pile, or uncovered cards in the pyramid structure.  A player's turn ends when he takes the drawn card and either makes a trick with it, places it in storage, discards it to the Sphinx, or exchanges it with a card already in storage and discards that card to the Sphinx.<br/><br/>When all of the cards from the Oasis have been drawn and played, the hand ends and players score points for: the Last Royal Trick (last trick played that contains a Queen, Pharaoh, or Camel) for 1 point, Pyramids (clearing the last card from the pyramids) for i point, Majority (most tricks captured) for 2 points, Scarabs (most Scarab suit cards captured) for 2 points, and Camels at 1 point per captured Camel.

What follows are the complete rules to a miniatures version of the game.<br/><br/>Mongolian Goat Rodeo<br/><br/>This is a miniatures horse racing game that recreates the Afghan game Buzkashi - Goat Grabbing. In the real game players are all mounted. The first player to grab the goat scores a point. The player who gets the goat around a goal scores a point and the player who gets it back to the starting point scores a point. In between everyone tries to grab the goat.<br/><br/>Each player runs a team of three riders. You need a start post, a goal post, two six sided dice, and ten tokens per player to make unexpected things happen. Place a goat token on the start post. The youngest player goes first. Go around the table to the right. Place one rider on the table. Once all the riders are placed the youngest player takes the first turn.<br/><br/>A turn consists of grabbing the goat and moving or moving and grabbing the goat. The player needs to be next to goat to grab it. They make up a story about how they get the goat. They pick another player to decide what they have to roll equal to or higher on 2d6 to succeed. Most players set the roll at 7+.<br/><br/>The player rolls 2d6 per rider. If they move only in the 180 degree arch to their front they move the total number in inches. If they move at all in the 180 degree arch to their rear, or are carrying the goat, they move the larger of the two rolls. Riders may not move through other riders but may squeeze through gaps. End moves pointed in any direction you like.<br/><br/>At any time a player may spend one of their tokens and make up any other kind of event. Maybe they get an extra turn or maybe they fight someone. They pick another player to set their roll just like with goat grabbing.<br/><br/>After the goat is brought home, players use their remaining tokens to get extra victory points. They lie about what they did and another player sets what they have to roll. They get as many rolls as they have tokens. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>The first edition of Mongolian Goat Rodeo (2006) was a board game, while the second edition (2013) is a card game in which players need to supply their own dice, ruler and coins in order to play.

Sample categories include something edible, something made of wood, something fragile, and something round. One player flips the sand timer, then everyone tries to find matching items in the drawing, covering those items with colored tokens. After time runs out, everyone reveals their answers, and for each correct answer, the player places one of her tokens in the center of the table. Players then choose a new drawing, each using the same one, and start a new round. The first player to get rid of all of her tokens wins.<br/><br/>In level two, players use the letters on the spinner (instead of the categories) and now look for items that start with the chosen letter.

Erickson and T.F. Erickson, Jr. began<br/>boardgame development. In an era when both the railroad and board gaming industry was in flux, the Ericksons managed to combine elements from the two to create a game that has withstood the test of time. In fact, it provided solid footing for the whole &quot;train gaming&quot; genre.<br/><br/>The Ericksons decided to publish the game on their own, and released it as &quot;BOXCARS&quot; in 1974. It was billed as &quot;The Informative NEW travel game of OLD-time railroading.&quot; For a first-time effort, the components of the resulting boardgame were surprisingly refined and professional.<br/><br/>The single-piece board unfolded to reveal a map of the United States on which routes of 28 historic railroads were traced. The rules of BOXCARS vary from those of Rail Baron in several ways. For example, BOXCARS has no restriction in the re-use of routes: this allows players to circle along the same track as long as desired. BOXCARS also allows a player to trade, sell or auction a RR at any time during the game. Furthermore, BOXCARS lacks the Express and Superchief locomotive upgrades that Rail Baron contains.<br/><br/>Before long, the Ericksons' game caught the attention of The Avalon Hill Game Company (AH). The original designers apparently sold the BOXCARS rights to AH and were obligated to quickly disperse the remaining copies of their game. It is estimated that there were only 1000 copies of BOXCARS ever printed.<br/><br/>AH scaled down the game's physical size to match the &quot;bookshelf&quot; style of many of its other titles, modified the rules, and released it as Rail Baron in 1977.<br/><br/>(Description adapted with permission from &quot;An Illustrated History of Rail Baron&quot;)<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"191346": "English first edition"}, "name": "Boxcars", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "average": "6.53636", "usersrated": "154", "age": "13"}, "24226": {"boardgamedesigner": {"7321": {"name": "Patrick Receveur"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fr\u00e8res d'Armes", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "5", "boardgamefamily": {"5914": "CMGs (Collectible Miniatures Games)"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic552826_t.jpg", "average": "7.4", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5649": {"name": "Fenryll"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic552826.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1044": {"name": "Collectible Components"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Fr&egrave;res d'Armes is a rule of game for every period of history, romans, medieval and even Fantasy.<br/>It's a skirmish game with collectible figures, and you can also use it for role playing.<br/>You need about ten figurines of any sort in each team, one die (10,20 or 30)and a few coins.<br/>28 mm figurine are all right for this game.<br/>You can find resin figurines for this game sold by the publisher.<br/>Notice that the rules are in French and in english.<br/>Expansion are all in french.<br/><br/>"}, "24227": {"boardgamedesigner": {"7335": {"name": "McRey Moyer"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Cobras in the Cockpit", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "26", "boardgamefamily": {"7509": "Animals: Snakes"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic260845_t.jpg", "average": "6.40769", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5650": {"name": "Secret Doors Game Studio"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic260845.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"230101": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1089": {"name": "Animals"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "From the website:<br/><br/>Cobras in the Cockpit is a game based on a fictional movie where YOU play the SNAKES!

If there are four or more aircraft carriers, then the battle will be a carrier battle, and all ships use their aircraft.  If, instead, there are five or more battleships, all ships will use their big guns.  Otherwise, the ships will employ their torpedoes.

The Italians had used air power (if it could be called that) in North Africa in 1911, and Louis Bl&eacute;riot&rsquo;s famous trip across the English Channel was still a fresh memory.<br/><br/>The Great War was a time of heroes and villains, a war where everyone knew who was fighting whom and for what cause. Both sides had their great victories, huge defeats and plenty of trench foot. While this game is designed to simulate the greatest battles over the trenches of the World War I battlefield, we should not forget that men and women died for their beliefs and for their countries. Heroes were born of this combat on both sides.<br/><br/>At no other time in our warring history has there been such a change as the airplane. Not only did combat change forever once our soldiers were airborne, but a whole generation became enamored of this newest weapon in our military arsenal. Even into the twenty-first century, the romance and joys of those first years in the air evoke the deepest respect for these new knights, these men of the airways.<br/>Aces at Dawn is a game of quasi-historical combat in the skies. Set at the turn of the century, the game models the man-to-man combat of the World-War I flying ace and his dreaded enemies. As with all Majestic Twelve games, Aces at Dawn is fun and easy to play, works with any line of miniatures, and encourages players to use their imagination and have fun, which is the way wargaming is supposed to be.<br/><br/>With 36 planes at your disposal and a fully-customizable points system, you can build existing planes we haven't included and also try out designs that you think would have wreaked havoc in the skies of France.<br/><br/>The flexibility of the system allows players to recreate the man-to-man air jousting at the turn of the twentieth century. A simple combat and maneuver system means you can dispense with complicated maneuver charts and intricately detailed plane record-keeping. What&rsquo;s left on the board is just plain fun.<br/><br/>The ZIP file includes both full-color and printer-friendly PDF versions of the rulebook.<br/><br/>"}, "24300": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6256": {"name": "Matt Curtis"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Iron Stars: Southern Front", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic133069_t.jpg", "average": "6.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"710": {"name": "Majestic Twelve Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic133069.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"265516": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Southern Front is the second supplement for Iron Stars, the game of space combat in an age of steam and steel.

The survivors have banded together for mutual protection, resources are scarce and every other group is either a threat or an obstacle.<br/>The background of the Babylon's Burning game is it's core - not a few paragraphs tagged on to the rules as an afterthought. You're introduced into the game with an extensive history of the Hit and an overview of the world of 2025 and drawn in further with the extensive fiction and the beautifully rendered and atmospheric original artwork that appears throughout.<br/><br/>The game mechanics are detailed but intuitive. This is a skirmish level game suitable for anything from a handful of troops to forty or so miniatures per side. Squads, solo elements (officers, snipers, medics and runners) and support weapons move according to a variable initiative system - there is no waiting around twiddling your thumbs while your opponent moves their entire force and the system is perfect for games with more than 2 players.<br/><br/>While it uses a fictional setting, Babylon's Burning recognizes the realities of modern combat. In order to come out on top, players need to keep moving, pick their targets well, take advantage of suppression and, most of all, utilize the terrain of tomorrow's shattered cities. This is a game that rewards players who ask themselves &quot;what would I do?&quot; - pushing blindly forward in tight formations is a good way to get very dead, very quickly.<br/>Another advantage of the realistic setting is that there are no &quot;super units&quot; - in the confines of a dark alley, a nail-studded baseball bat is as deadly a weapon as any other...<br/><br/>The game accommodates a wide selection of faction types - Enclaves, Street Gangs, Mercs, Scavs, Ghouls, Culties, Mobs and Syndicates - all of them complete with their own restrictions and advantages. These factions don't just look different; they play differently too. From well armed Enclave militia built around a crack corps of pre-Hit professionals to street kid gangs moving about the table with dizzying speed on skateboards and roller blades, Babylon's Burning allows the player to choose the faction that best reflects their style of play.<br/><br/>FEATURES -<br/><br/>100 pages - looks great in color or black and white<br/>Full-color counters and burst templates<br/>Quick reference sheet and record sheets<br/>Extensive scene-setting fiction by Jay Forster<br/>Beautiful artwork by Elena Vanin, Jim Campbell and Craig Humpston<br/><br/>REVIEWS -<br/><br/>&quot;The first thing to strike me was the very well produced and laid out format&hellip;the rules themselves are well thought out [with] plenty of examples interspersed in the text [and] are framed by an engrossing piece of fiction.<br/><br/>The best point of the rules is simply the fact that they are generic in their outlook - they are intended for use with any figures on the market, so they are not bound to a specific company's miniatures. This is a bonus, because you can use any figures you want, unlike some systems that insist on the sole use of 'official' figures.&quot;<br/>(From the WARGAMES DIRECTORY review)<br/><br/>&quot;The background material is very plausible and I think well researched as to the possibilities of this occurrence actually happening.

Designer John Prados transports his Panzerkrieg game system to the Western Front to examine the major episodes of this clash. Using scenarios, which can also be linked together to form a campaign game, he covers the entire war in France and the Low Countries from early September 1944 to the German surrender in May 1945. Players on both sides will be challenged with conducting offensive operations as well as desperate defenses.<br/><br/>Units are mostly divisions with some specialist brigades/regiments (engineers, commandos, heavy or specialized armor units). Players can form larger Corps level formations that enhance combat actions. The air war is also covered with air units on both sides conducting air superiority, ground support, parachute and aerial supply missions. The game design is easy to get into, but loaded with much decision-making for both players. The level of supply and logistical support determines how many units and leaders can conduct operations in the turn. Leadership on both sides, in the form of the various Army and Front Headquarters as well as the leaders from each, play vital roles in the various operations each turn. While the Allies can field a tremendous force across the entire front, the lack of ports and the Allied ever-lengthening supply lines will be a challenge in keeping the offensive moving. The German player will have less of a challenge in providing logistical support, but his already battered Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe and SS formations will face a hard time in fending off the enemy&rsquo;s attacks while also gathering strength and resources for a counter-strike. Timing, planning, and making the most of the opportunities presented to you on the battlefield are key to success in this game by award-winning designer, John Prados.<br/><br/>Rules in Toppling the Reich include ones dealing with the various Army and Corps Commanders on both sides, Paratroop drops and airpower, a very clever depiction of ULTRA capabilities (and failures), the planning and timing for German counter-attacks. Toppling the Reich is actually six different games: five scenarios which cover the Western Front from September 1944 to April 1945 and one 36 turn Campaign Game which includes this entire period. The smaller scenarios include:<br/><br/>Scenario 1: Broad Front or Narrow Thrust? (Market-Garden)<br/>Sept. 1-24, 1944 (four turns)<br/>Having broken out of Normandy, Allied troops capture Paris and press toward the German frontier. The Germans strive to rebuild the strength of their Fifth Panzer Army, destroyed in the Falaise Pocket, and to reconstitute a solid defense. The Allied commander has a very limited attack supply capability and must choose between attacking all along the front or concentrating for a single powerful attack.<br/><br/>Scenario 2: See Germany and Die! Closing Up to the Westwall<br/>Sept. 25-Nov. 11, 1944 (8 turns)<br/>Against a rapidly solidifying German defense, Allied armies attempt to maximize their gains in spite of their still limited supply abilities. The full deployment of the Allied Sixth Army Group north of the Swiss border and the continued offensive stance of Patton&rsquo;s Third Army press the Germans in Lorraine back towards the Rhine. At the same time, the Americans in the center take Aachen while the British attain the line of the Meuse.<br/><br/>Scenario 3: The Roer River and Lorraine<br/>Nov. 12-Dec. 10, 1944 (5 turns)<br/>Greatly recovered from its Normandy debacle, the German army by November 1944 is offering stiff resistance to the Allies. For their part, Allied armies attempt to clear the right bank of the Rhine in Lorraine, and to expand and secure their penetration of the Westwall at Aachen. This stage of the war sees some of the most bitter and bloody fighting in the Western Front.<br/><br/>Scenario 4: Herbstnebel-Nordwind: From the Bulge to Alsace.<br/>Dec. 11, 1944-Feb. 2, 1945 (9 turns)<br/>The Allied advance has been essentially brought to a halt before the Westwall. The German High Command made a conscious decision about their strategy for the next phase of the campaign. Adolf Hitler opts for a counter-offensive, and attacks are planned in the Ardennes and toward Strassbourg. The Germans throw their best forces into a last great gamble to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.<br/><br/>Scenario 5: The Defense of the Rhine<br/>Feb. 4-Apr. 3, 1945 (10 turns)<br/>After the failure of the Bulge and Alsace offensives, an exhausted German army returns to the Westwall to discover that the Allies are already prepared for a bone-shattering frontal offensive. Allied troops grind through the Westwall defenses and the Germans attempt to hold the Rhine. Hitler, dissatisfied with the situation in the West, relieves his best commanders. With the end of the war nearing, an important question for the Allied Command is what kind of attack force should be brought to bear against Berlin.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"27396": "Against the Odds magazine edition"}, "average": "5.46571", "name": "Toppling the Reich", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "35", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"134": "Magazine: Against The Odds"}}, "24326": {"boardgamedesigner": {"4565": {"name": "Ginichiro Suzuki"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Kenshin vs Shingen: Battle of Kawanakajima", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic762929_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3475": {"name": "Arclight"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic762929.jpg", "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "This game simulates the clash between Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin that took place near the Kawanakajima plains on September 10th, 1561 (1561 being Eiroku 4 in the calendar system of the time).

Players alternately drop one of their twenty &quot;Goola&quot; beads into one of the five slots in the Goola Tower trying to form a line of 4 or 5 beads of their color in order to accumulate points (1 point for a line of 4 and 2 points for a line of 5).  The twist here is that scoring only happens after all the beads are placed.  After the initial placement, each player then alternately operate one of the five mechanic valves at the bottom of the tower under each slot to make the beads drop one by one out the bottom of the tower.  After each bead drops out, each player count all the points they get for forming lines of 4 or 5 beads of the same color. The player with the higher points scores the difference in points on the scoreboard.  The first player to reach 8 points on the scoreboard wins.  A further twist can be found in the blind-play option built in the Goola Tower.  This advance play is similar to the basic game except that the bead placement is shielded from the players' sight, and the players must reply on memory to calculate where to place their beads.  After all the beads are played, the lock mechanism is released allowing the beads to drop into sight and the game continues as normal.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>40 Goola beads in two colors<br/>1 Goola tower<br/>1 Tower base with scoreboard<br/>2 Goola stickers<br/>1 Rulebook<br/><br/>"}, "24336": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2957": {"name": "Scotty Bowden"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Empire", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "usersrated": "10", "yearpublished": "1990", "boardgameimplementation": {"198629": "Revolution & Empire"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic152447_t.jpg", "average": "5.8", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1555": {"name": "The Emperor's Press"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic152447.jpg", "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "H.G.

If not, the play moves clockwise.  There is a space for asking two questions, losing a turn or receiving a &quot;big hint&quot;.  The player reads the &quot;big hint&quot; question on the card and the group is allowed to respond beyond yes/no.  The player then ends his turn.<br/><br/>If you guess your celebrity name wrong, you still get to keep on playing, you place a new, random celebrity name into your headband.<br/><br/>There are also blank cards so you can write in other people's names who may only be celebrities in your world.<br/><br/>"}, "24380": {"boardgamedesigner": {"79521": {"name": "David North (II)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hunters in the Sky", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2005", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic199635_t.jpg", "average": "8.33333", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"5677": {"name": "Polaris Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic199635.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"257434": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"2650": {"name": "Aviation / Flight"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Hunters in the Sky is a complete miniatures game of WWII air combat.

By this time, the French and Americans had all left. It was now a British show and one that was destined to leave a bloody nose upon the Reds. At least that was the plan! As the troops gathered along both sides of the Dvina River (the river was very large), the opposing forces were as determined. The Reds fielded the 3rd Brigade\\18th Division amounting to the 160, 161, 162 Regiments, numerous large artillery barges, six fighter aircraft, many gunboats, lots of mines, trenches. The overconfident British had not factored in the effects of Mother Nature, which as the battle wore on, smiled too often on the Red forces. Clearing BOTH sides of this major river ( think Mississippi) and advancing hundreds of miles to Kotlas (the main Red base) in hindsight, seemed like a crazy idea, but at the time, was a tempting objective. And so it was. The Dvina River Offensive had it all: dogfighting aircraft, ground combat, naval surface action, naval bombardment, bombing, machine guns, artillery, river monitors and gunboats, unpredictable river currents, water levels, sandbars, floating mines sent down by the Reds, foul weather, balloons. The offensive lasted four days. One part went extraordinarily well-another part nosedived into hell-both sides get to enjoy this game!<br/><br/>Game scale is 750 yds a hex, turns are 12 hrs, 10 in all. Ground units are platoons, artillery batteries, single aircraft include: Sopwith, Spad, Avro, DH9A, Re 8, Neuiport, M20 and Short. River ships include: monitors, gunboats, each representing one ship. Ground units include Lewis guns, MG, Stokes mortars, leaders, infantry. There are two game maps, one covers the ground action and the other the air to air combat at a different scale (50 yd a hex). Aircraft are rated for speed, bombing, size, maneuver, altitude.

It could be regarded as an early form of Pinball, but despite its erstwhile popularity, it was all but forgotten in the latter half of the 20th century. Recently replica boards are making a bit of a comeback, and &quot;het Hamertjesspel&quot; can be seen again at village f&ecirc;tes and other occasions that encourage nostalgic throw-back entertainment.<br/><br/>Four players sit on each side of a square wooden board with raised edges, defending their goal. A marble or small lead ball is dropped in the centre, either by hand or, on the more evolved board versions, through a &quot;fair&quot; central dropping device. Players try to get the marble into an opponent's goal, and keep their own one safe, by using a small wooden mallet (&quot;Hamer&quot; is Dutch for &quot;Hammer&quot;). To make life difficult for the players, the goal is split up in two by a centre isle, and spanned by a rail, so that it is impossible to block both halves simultaneously, or swap the hammer between goal sides easily. The board itself has a few obstacles (usually exposed nails) that deflect the marble.  Game play is best typified as frantic fun.<br/><br/>The boards tend to have a slight slope towards the centre point. The square versions commonly use 4 wood sections in a pyramid style. The &quot;Karrewiel&quot; (Cart Wheel), which is the round board version usually had more panes to create a nicer circular slope. Occasionally it would also be able to accommodate more than the standard 4 players, or have each player's goal area split in three gaps, rather than two. Most boards would have only one marble in play, but, reportedly, there are variants that had multiple balls simultaneously in the battle arena. If less people were playing, parts of the board could be blocked off using temporary wooden walls.<br/><br/>Traditionally, the first player to lose a certain amount of goals would have to buy the next round. Like all pub games, it was also played for money, and onlookers placed bets on the game's outcome.<br/><br/>In 1995 Battle Dome appeared, which is a modern flipper version of this traditional game, with a few added bells and whistles. In 2000 Felsburger produced the traditional Karrewiel version under the name Ch&uuml;ngel. Needless to say, most versions of the game keep coming from the Low Lands wood crafts cottage industry, that is slowly &quot;rediscovering&quot; this lost gem.

Goal tries are similarly determined by die throws adjusted to the positioning of the goalkeeper and other defensive players.<br/><br/>From Designer's Notes:<br/>KICK-OFF Soccer has been developed to follow as closely as possible the real game of soccer.  The strategy and tactics are the same, as are most of the rules.  Soccer is not a complicated game.  There are very few set plays, these mainly arise on Corners, Free-Kicks and Throw-Ins.  The game is played through with the skills, flair and innovation of individual players working together as a team.  And so with &quot;KICK-OFF&quot;, by using simple Basic Moves, the flair and innovation has been left up to the individual player.<br/>After playing one or two games of &quot;KICK-OFF&quot;, the method of play becomes easy and only brief reference is necessary to player and ball movement, and die throws.  The die throws do not determine the outcome of the game, they merely simulate the chances played in real soccer.<br/>&quot;KICK-OFF&quot; has been play tested by enthusiastic &quot;youngsters&quot; aged from eleven to adult.

Players take turns using the spinner, and then selecting one tile.<br/><br/>If the tile says &quot;free spin&quot;, then the tile is added to that player's chain, and the player immediately takes an additional turn.<br/><br/>If the tile matches the shape(s) on the spinner, then the tile is added to the player's chain of tiles, and that player's turn ends.<br/><br/>If the tile does not match the shape on the spinner, the tile is shown to the other players, and then returned face-down to the available tiles.<br/><br/>If the tile says &quot;stop&quot;, then it is attached to the top of the spinner.  When the fourth &quot;stop&quot; tile is drawn, the game ends.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"177049": "First edition"}, "name": "Sesame Street Simple Shapes Game", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5861": "TV Series: Sesame Street"}}, "24455": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6930": {"name": "H.

However, this game is much more complex in its variant forms.<br/><br/>Initially, the base setup is for each person to turn all of their picture cubes to the 1 numbered picture--the easiest items to spot.  Goal: Spot five items or a picture of each of the five items, revealing 5 X's which form a straight line.<br/><br/>Rise To The Top:  In this variant, each person does not reveal the X upon sighting a 1 numbered item.  Instead, the person will turn the number two picture to the top.  This continues until the number three item is sighted, and the X is turned up.  The first person to five X's in a row wins.<br/><br/>Go For Points:  Similar to Above.  Attach a time limit or mileage limit to the game.

Highest total wins.<br/><br/>This can be played as a solo variant, with a solo player trying to accomplish point goals per number of miles, or trip duration.<br/><br/>The Handicapper:  In a child versus adult game, using the base game rules, the adult would adjust their numbered pictures to a 4 or 5 starting point.<br/><br/>One Block At A Time:  Start with all X's showing.  Each person will take out the first block in their container.  As soon as either player sees one of the five items, they replace the block in their container with the picture showing of the item spotted.  They then move on to their next block, until all 25 blocks are gone through.<br/><br/>The game ends when one person is done with all 25 blocks.  Total all points of exposed pictures.<br/><br/>Get Nasty:  Each player arranges the cubes of their opponent, using the number five pictures of each number (5-5's, 5'4's, etc...) and arranges them in a way which is thought to be most difficult to achieve 5 in a row.  Same as base game otherwise.<br/><br/>Composite Game:  Start with all number 1's.  As you see each item, turn that cube over to X.  When you get five X's in a row, turn that row over to the number two pictures.  Continue with the same goals, turning five in a row over at a time until you get the five numbered pictures.  The first person to turn over five number five pictures, revealing the final X's, wins.

You get a hand of cards and each card corresponds to one of the acts. You start with one card face down in front of you. There is also a face-up pool of cards plus a draw pile.<br/><br/>On your turn, you turn up your face down card and play it beside the corresponding act. You then take on card from the pool and one from the deck. Finally, you place a card face down (which will be played on your next turn).<br/><br/>When one act gets three cards beside it, play stops for the 'Hit Parade'. Starting from top to bottom, each act moves up a number of spaces equal to the cards played beside it (this can push acts it passes down the column). The cards played are put into the pool and play continues.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck runs out. You get points for the cards left in your hand - if you have cards for the act at the top of the column you get five points each, for each card for the second act you get four points, etc. Whoever has the most points at the end wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"30060": "English edition"}, "name": "Megastar", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "average": "5.47505", "usersrated": "436", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5499": "Family Games"}, "age": "8"}, "24474": {"boardgamedesigner": {"7388": {"name": "Joe Burch"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "YARR!", "playingtime": "180", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2046": "Area Movement"}, "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic139194_t.jpg", "average": "7.375", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic139194.jpg", "maxplaytime": "180", "boardgamecategory": {"1020": {"name": "Exploration"}}, "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "YARR! is the newest game set in the 'Age of Piracy.'

Their starships combine the awesome firepower of powerful particle accelerator beam energy weapons and devastating hyper-speed torpedoes for close combats and long-range raids by smaller ship-borne strike craft and the deadly mercenary shadowcraft. The four different species can ally in various patterns, resulting in different combinations in different games, or they can operate alone. Players determine when and where to seek battles; to launch distant raids or close with the enemy for battles within star systems or nebulae. The side that scores the most victory points by vaporizing enemy ships and winning star systems wins the game. This is an entertaining and fun card game where every playing is different.

If you control that company, your company's profits will increase as well.<br/><br/>The basics of the game:<br/><br/>There is one more business than there are the number of players, each with different company values. Players each have 14 chips with investment values printed on them (4 X 5, 3 X 10, 3 X 50, 1 X 100, 1 X 200, 1 X 300, 1 X 400). They (usually) secretly place these one at a time near a business they wish to invest in. The 2nd, 5th, and some later investments made in each company are made publicly (everyone sees the investment amount).<br/><br/>Players gain control of a company by having more invested in the company at the end of the game than any of the other players (and get more points for having more than all the other players combined). The tricky part being that a player will almost always need to have control of 2 or more business to win, but there's not enough businesses to be able to do so easily, so each player *will* have to out-invest another player, which involves bluffing them as to where your high-value investment chips are.<br/><br/>Each player also chooses an 'investment strategy' card at the beginning of the game, and plays it at some point during the game, changing things like making the value of a company halved, or giving them extra shares in a company, etc.<br/><br/>"}, "24495": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic243745.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"5586": {"name": "Yasutaka Ikeda"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2003", "maxplayers": "6", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": {"4315": {"name": "Wild Heaven"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic243745_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1035": {"name": "Medieval"}}, "description": "Also known as 'Conquerors of the Eastern Country'.<br/><br/>A 2-6 player game set in feudal Eastern Japan(2-12 players if combined with Heroes of Western Japan).<br/><br/>Meant to appeal to fans of the many feudal multi-player games that came out in the 80s in Japan and of 'eurogame' fans wanting something quicker.<br/><br/>It ends up playing like a fast-paced 'History of the World'.
