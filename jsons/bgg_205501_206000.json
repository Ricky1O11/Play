Connectors and skill tiles can be used to upgrade location tiles for additional victory points and productivity.<br/><br/>The game is played over four eras, and in each era, new location tiles will be available for bidding. In both era 1 and 2, these tiles consist of six resource-generating tiles, plus some additional building tiles.  In era 3, there will be only building tiles, which arrive already upgraded. In era 4, some of the Routemaster tiles become available.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player chooses one of five actions. They may use one or more of their team of wooden workers (&quot;keyples&quot;) to (1) bid for a location tile, (2) use a location tile to generate resources, or (3) upgrade a location. They may (4) pass, in which case they may play again in that era, or (5) cease playing in that era by setting off in their sailing barge along the Thames. The game finishes after the last river barge sets sail at the end of era 4, at which point the player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>Key to the City &ndash; London has similarities in structure to the award-winning 2012 R&amp;D game Keyflower.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition", "Quined Master Print edition"], "average": "7.22658", "name": "Key to the City \u2013 London", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Modular Board", "Set Collection", "Tile Placement", "Worker Placement"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "585", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Key-series", "Quined Master Print Edition Series"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Ep 042 \u2013 Essen Spiel 2016 Preview", "Episode 32 - The Essen Games We Have to Have", "Episode 38 - What Exactly are We Using Kickstarter For?", "HLG 9: Essen in Zicht", "Podblast:  Edward\u2019s Essen interview with Richard Breese!", "The Game Pit: Episode 72 - Spiel 2016 Treasure Hunt Part 2", "The Game Pit: Episode 77 - Picking Over the Bones", "The Good The Board and Jon and Nate plus\u202610: Episode 97\u2033Nate\u2019s top 10 of 2016\u2033"]}, "205508": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version 0.2", "PDF Version 0.7", "PDF Version 0.8", "PDF Version 1.3", "PDF Version 1.4"], "statistics": [], "name": "Scoundrel D6", "rpgdesigner": ["Roberto Padron"], "rpgproducer": ["Roberto Padron"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3136722.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpg": ["Scoundrel D6"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3136722_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Characters in the system are defined by Attributes (Body, Presence, Perception, Coordination, and Wits) - each with a possible Specialization - and Skills.

But sometimes, it can be fun to take on the mantle of the otherworldly, and to embrace the alien terrors of the cosmos. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Eldritch Archetypes contains five archetypes for eldritch characters&mdash;those that are weird, alien, and otherworldly, who don&rsquo;t fit in with normal society&mdash;as well as a cleric domain devoted to a specific mythos entity or race.<br/><br/>This particular installment focuses on shoggoths, the ancient and primordial servitor race described at length in H. P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s At the Mountains of Madness. These roiling horrors of pulsing flesh, which can take any shape and can spawn new organs and limbs as easily as most creatures breathe, have long been a source of fascination for readers of strange fiction. This book contains the following archetypes:<br/><br/>    The transmografist, an alchemist archetype that specializes in transforming into weird and terrible shapes, and can spray horrible mucus to harm and blind his foes.<br/>    The protoplasmic rager, a barbarian archetype whose body alters in combat, giving her extendable arms, shielding her organs, and causing her to grow to immense size.<br/>    The writhing thrasher, a brawler archetype, which also has variable anatomy, and can gain monstrous features as easily as most brawlers gain feats.<br/>    The seeker of the strange, an investigator archetype that gains inspiration in strange ways, is a master of occult lore, and can harden his skin and warp his flesh.<br/>    The shoggoth bloodline, for sorcerers, which can create balls of protoplasm, grow various limbs, and attack foes with masses of tentacles.<br/>    A bonus cleric domain devoted to those who worship shoggoths as gods.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Whether you're about to embark on a campaign of eldritch horror (such as the official Paizo adventure path dealing with strange and alien entities), or you just want an excuse to play a servant of the unknowable and uncaring cosmic entities of the Cthulhu mythos, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for insane cultist NPCs as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.<br/><br/>"}, "205531": {"rpgartist": ["Scott Harshbarger", "Steven Trustrum"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Knights of the Pentangle", "rpgdesigner": ["Steven Trustrum"], "rpgproducer": ["Steven Trustrum"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3120703.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)", "Fantasy (Arthurian)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Misfit Studios"], "rpg": ["Savage Worlds"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Super-Powered"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3120703_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The Knights of the Pentangle Return to Fight Evil alongside King Arthur<br/><br/>Another offering in Misfits Studios' Super-Powered series for the Savage Worlds rules, The Knights of the Pentangle details the returned Once and Future King of the Britons and his new reincarnated knights.

The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.

Only the mad, desperate, or power-hungry seek to wield it&mdash;and you are one of them.<br/><br/>Deep Magic: Void Magic brings the secrets of these dark conjurations into your 5e campaign, featuring:<br/><br/>    A Void school of wizard magic, with two new feats: Void Channeler, and Void Scribe<br/>    A Void Speaker arcane tradition, with new abilities including Whispers of the Void, Rebuke from Beyond, and Powerful Echo<br/>    13 new spells, including conjure voidborn, life drain, maddening whispers, word of misfortune, and more!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Who can say what drives you to master the magic of the void, casting spells that threaten to unmake the universe itself? Yet it may be that someday, when all seems lost, you will be the one who has the power to save the world.<br/><br/>"}, "205556": {"statistics": [], "bgaccessoryversion": ["First edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3130777.jpg", "description": "A thin playmat for Roll for the Galaxy for holding the supply of dice (ordered by dice color) and victory points.

However, the NANAKI devour the remaining cards on the table, making themselves hard to be overcome. At the end, the characters must confront the NANAKI which has been grown by the players' intentions!<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u539f\u4f5c\u306b\u3057\u305f\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\uff01<br/><br/>30\u4eba\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u4e2d\u304b\u30895\u4eba\u306e\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u3001\u751f\u304d\u5ef6\u3073\u308d\uff01<br/>\u30c8\u30e9\u30a6\u30de\u304c\u5177\u73fe\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30d0\u30b1\u30e2\u30ce\u3008\u30ca\u30ca\u30ad\u3009\u3068\u5bfe\u6c7a\u3059\u308b<br/>\u30b5\u30d0\u30a4\u30d0\u30eb\u30db\u30e9\u30fc\u30fb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\uff01<br/><br/>\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\uff08\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u4eba\u6570+1\u679a\uff09\u3092\u3001<br/>\u5fc3\u306e\u529b\u3092\u8c61\u5fb4\u3059\u308b5\u8272\u306e\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u5f37\u5316\u3057\u3001\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u52a0\u3048\u3066\u3044\u304f\u3002<br/>\u3060\u304c\u3001\u6b8b\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u30ca\u30ca\u30ad\u306b\u5438\u53ce\u3055\u308c\u3001\u6210\u9577\u3057\u3066\u3044\u304f\u306e\u3060\u3002<br/>\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306e\u601d\u60d1\u3092\u5438\u53ce\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u6210\u9577\u3059\u308b\u30ca\u30ca\u30ad\u3068\u5bfe\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u306e\u3060\uff01\uff01<br/><br/>"}, "205583": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jason Nelson", "Alex Riggs"], "rpg": ["Pathfinder System Compatible Product"], "poll": [], "name": "Intrigue Feats I", "rpgartist": ["Rian Trost"], "rpgproducer": ["Jason Nelson"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3121149.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "8", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Legendary Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Mythic Minis"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3121149_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Intrigue Feats I is the latest Mythic Mini devoted to exploring the subtle arts of intrigue, using the power of suggestion and sedition to upset and dismay your enemies, leading them astray through clever wordplay.

You&rsquo;ll need both a tactical approach as well as a fair amount of luck. Two to four players meet in this game for a struggle of sheer survival. Only the player who&rsquo;s best prepared and whose cards match the conditions can obtain the opponents&rsquo; cards and collect points.<br/><br/>Before each turn a player &ndash; the Darwin &ndash; rolls the dice. The combination of number (1 to 8) and colour (blue, green and yellow) determine which card becomes the trump during this turn. Additionally, one die (with + and -) specifies if high or low numbers have an advantage.<br/>Each player then plays a card upside down and then flip them over simultaneously. The player of the strongest card wins, becomes the new Darwin and rolls the dice for the next turn.<br/><br/>The strongest card is either the trump or &ndash; of no trump has been played &ndash; the highest or the lowest card. If it comes to a draw, the size of the animal is of the essence (+ for big / - for small). But there are three special cards as well:<br/>The red cards (1 to 8), if they should win a turn, although they are not able of becoming the trump and will always lose in a draw, they can destroy the collected cards of the player with the second best card.<br/>The grey cards (0 and 9) are always the highest or lowest numbers. They can only be beaten by the trump.<br/>The brown cards (4.5) are the worst cards, because they are neither the highest nor the lowest cards - they are right in the middle. But if the trump has been played, they are the only ones able to beat it.<br/><br/>A game consists of several rounds, each consisting of individual turns. Each turn consists of rolling the dice and playing one card. A round is over when all the hand cards have been played. The game is over when the card deck is used up.<br/><br/>At the end of each round &ndash; after all the hand cards have been played &ndash; the points of the cards, according to the number of symbols in the corner, are counted and written down. These points are safe and cannot be destroyed. <br/>At the end of the game &ndash; when the card deck is used up &ndash; the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.1", "name": "Darwin's Dice", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Trick-taking"], "age": "6", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["TRCP - Launch Episode 11"]}, "205597": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3121227.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Thomas Lehmann"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Martin Hoffmann", "Claus Stephan", "Mirko Suzuki"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Rio Grande Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3121227_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Science Fiction"], "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>With the invention of Jump Drive, the race for the galaxy begins!

Once, you even caught yourself trying to scratch behind your ear.  <br/>With your foot.<br/>Last night, you heard howling in the distance and it made the fur&hellip; er&hellip; little hairs on the back of your neck... stand at attention&hellip;<br/><br/>Wolven is a solitaire hidden role deduction game in which you (as the Slayer) seek to identify and eliminate the werewolves before they overrun the village&hellip; AND before you sprout fur and claws!<br/><br/>The tokens in Wolven each have a picture of a villager on their front.  Each unique villager has a special ability that aids the player in the process of deduction, earns silver, or helps protect other villagers against the werewolves.<br/><br/>The back of most of the tokens show picture of a Peasant, who is a sort of generic villager with a special ability of his own.  A few of the tokens, however, have werewolves on their reverse sides instead.  The object of the game is to identify which villagers have werewolves on the back and eliminate those tokens from play.<br/><br/>To spice up the deductive part of the game, one or more of the villagers might also have a Peasant on their front face.  So when you see a peasant on a token, you're not sure if you're looking at the back of a villager token, or the front of a peasant token.  If it's a peasant token,you're not sure if the reverse side is another peasant, or a werewolf!<br/><br/>The game is played by pulling tokens from a bag and viewing only one side, which is placed face up on the table.  You may continue drawing tokens until you decide to stop, or until you place a token that show a werewolf.<br/><br/>You may then spend silver to use the abilities of any of the face up villagers.<br/><br/>If you stopped drawing tokens before you drew a werewolf, you may then select the token of your choice to remove from the game.  Once it's removed from the game you can look at both sides to determine whether you've eliminated a werewolf or a villager.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you didn't stop drawing until a werewolf turned up, the token to be eliminated from play is selected randomly.  Drawing a werewolf also advances a token on the infection track.  If this token ever reaches the end of its track, another werewolf is added to the bag.<br/><br/>In either case, the tokens (other than that which was eliminated) are placed back in the bag and another round begins.<br/><br/>If, at the end of any round, all of the werewolves have been eliminated, the player wins.

You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.<br/><br/>No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.<br/><br/>Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...<br/><br/>The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground.

Geef de windrichting een slinger en kies de windrichting naar het Noorden, Zuiden, Oosten of Westen die het meest in de buurt komt<br/><br/>Door jouw onervarenheid als Kapitein mag je jouw schip in het begin maar steeds 1 veld verder zetten. Met upgrades zal je sneller en wendbaarder worden. Iedere keer nadat je jouw schip hebt verplaatst leg je direct daar omheen nieuwe zeetegels en ontdek je misschien wel nieuwe eilanden met een haven. Aangekomen bij een haven worden op de eilandenkaart bijgehouden welke goederen gekocht en verkocht kunnen worden en voor welke prijs. Met goudstukken koop je upgrades in de havens die je aandoet.

These applications, called Monte Carlo methods, required a large supply of random digits and normal deviates of high quality, and the tables presented here were produced to meet those requirements. This book was a product of RAND's pioneering work in computing, as well a testament to the patience and persistence of researchers in the early days of RAND. The tables of random numbers in this book have become a standard reference in engineering and econometrics textbooks and have been widely used in gaming and simulations that employ Monte Carlo trials. Still the largest published source of random digits and normal deviates, the work is routinely used by statisticians, physicists, poll-takers, market analysts, lottery administrators, and quality control engineers.<br/><br/>"}, "205741": {"poll": [], "name": "Mobius Final Fantasy", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iOS edition"], "average": "7", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Square Enix"], "videogamefranchise": ["Final Fantasy"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone"], "usersrated": "3", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Square Enix"], "description": "Despair has cast a long, dark shadow across this land.

Coudray's mysterious and enchanting images are heavily influenced by early twentieth century design, from the Art Deco movement to Surrealism, even while they convey stories and ideas that may be millennia old. In her art you&rsquo;ll find echoes of Picasso, Magritte, Matisse, Escher, Greek myth, Indian religion, pop music, internet memes, and much, much more... In these stylized pieces, reminiscent of New York City&rsquo;s architecture and glass Tiffany lamps, you&rsquo;ll find many allusions to ancient myths and folk tales.<br/><br/>Dixit: Revelations is an expansion for Dixit that contains 84 new cards for use with that game. In Dixit, each round one player takes on the role of Storyteller, choosing one card from his hand, then telling a story, singing a ditty, or otherwise doing something that in his opinion is associated with the played card. Each other player then chooses one card in her own hand and gives it to the Storyteller in secret. These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller. If either no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then he receives no points; if he received some votes but not all of the votes, he scores based on the number of votes received. Each player who submitted a correct vote or who received a vote on her card submission also scores.

When the mana pattern on the board matches the mana pattern of a monster, you can capture that monster.  Each monster captured along the way will give you more power and higher chance to complete the mission.<br/><br/>Your objective is to complete all 3 missions assigned by the Elders.

The city of Black Hills is right in the middle of this struggle, and a tough mayor is needed to put things in their place.<br/><br/>Black Hills is a resource management game for 2-4 players in which they need to accumulate resources to exchange them for status points. The first player to obtain five status points is appointed as the brand new mayor of Black Hills and wins.<br/><br/>The game has three different resources: wood, gold pieces and leather. In every round, each player chooses two character cards from the four cards they receive. There are 16 character cards between cowboys, settlers and indians; each character has its own ability and should be placed in one of four locations: woods, plains, city or the jail. Depending on the character and the locations, players acquire different resources or can invest their previously amassed goods in the city in exchange for status points.<br/><br/>The second deck of cards is the deck of the events. Every player can buy an event for the price of one gold piece and use it whenever they want. The events affect the regular development of the game, granting extra status points, closing locations, or forcing the rest of the players to lose some of their resources.<br/><br/>Don't want to invest your gold in event cards? Are you a more aggressive kind of player? Do you hate to manage resources? Keep calm because this is the Wild West and what would it be without some hired gunmen? In Black Hills, you can also use your money to hire a gunman to try to steal all the resources from your fellow players.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for? Come to the city of Black Hill and find your luck, but watch out because you could end up with nothing in your pockets or a bullet in your head!<br/><br/>"}, "205820": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["DOC Version", "PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "F.A.M.A.T.O.M.", "rpgdesigner": ["Louren Lee Lamb"], "rpgproducer": ["Louren Lee Lamb"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3125154.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["F.A.M.A.T.O.M."], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Campaign Setting (game world)", "Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Science Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3125154_t.jpg", "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>F.A.M.A.T.O.M. is a fantasy, horror, historic, sci-fi role-playing game.

The skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of long greenish-grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply. Their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the hips, deep set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk or feeler with purple annular markings, and with many evidences of being an undeveloped mouth or throat. The limbs&hellip; terminated in ridged-veined pads that were neither hooves nor claws.<br/><br/>Of genuine blood there was none; only the foetid greenish-yellow ichor which&hellip; left a curious discoloration behind it.<br/><br/>The Dunwich Horror, H P Lovecraft (1929)<br/><br/>For those moments when your players have taken the inevitable path away from whatever you have planned, From Unformed Realms provides the ideal tool for conjuring up a flash of inspiration. In 20 horror packed pages, the supplement provides myriad options for the random creation of horrific nightmares and unnameable monstrosities. You can either roll randomly with a 6-sided die or flick to a random page and choose a numbered section, then inflict the content on your appreciative players.<br/><br/>The supplement contains references and monsters based on the Horror genre. The book does contain references to acts of fictional violence and biological functions, but nothing unsuitable for someone sitting down to play a game of Lovecraftian investigative horror in the first place!<br/><br/>From Unformed Realms is a system-free supplement, easily adapted it to your favourite game system or campaign setting.

In this two-player variant of Bohnanza, both bean farmers give each other gifts of beans they can&lsquo;t use themselves &ndash; to make life harder for their opponent, if possible. Trying to fulfill their secret &ldquo;bo(h)nus&rdquo; requirements, they both need to keep a vigilant eye on the other player&rsquo;s bean fields. Give as good as you get in Bohnanza &ndash; Das Duell, there can be only one winner!<br/><br/>How to play Bohnanza &ndash; Das Duell:<br/>Both duelists have bean field mats in front of themselves to plant their beans on. Between them, there is a row of eight gift cards. Each player holds five hand cards and three &ldquo;bo(h)nus cards&rdquo; with secret objectives. Playing the bean duel, you have the option of planting more than one type of bean in the same field, but when you plant a different bean than the one you&rsquo;ve planted before, it has to have the next highest number than the one before. When harvesting your beans, it&rsquo;s the beanometer of the last card you&rsquo;ve planted that counts.<br/>At the start of each turn, the active player plants two beans from their hand and turns over bean cards as usual. Instead of trading, however, they offer their opponent one bean as a gift by pushing this bean type&rsquo;s gift card in their direction. The other player can accept the gift or decline it, but if they don&rsquo;t take it, they have to offer a gift in return. You are allowed to bluff, but it may cost you if your bluff is called! Important: Only the first player to accept a gift actually receives the bean card in question. After this exchange, plant all beans you have received and turned over, then draw new cards.<br/>&ldquo;Bo(h)nus&rdquo; cards can be fulfilled at any time when the required combination of beans printed on the card can be found in any bean field. Fulfilling an objective earns you bean dollars and the brand new bean cents. When the draw pile is used up, the player with the most bean dollars wins the game.<br/><br/>Bohnanza &ndash; Das Duell is a variant of the popular bean trading game Bohnanza designed exclusively for two players.

Glimpsing through those manholes might give you an idea what awaits you down there...<br/>This allows you to make an educated guess about which way might be the best path through the cave while still allowing for surprises along the way.<br/><br/>The second part of the cave is the hidden information track that is used to store everything that is hidden and happening below ground in the chambers of the cave you haven&acute;t discovered yet.<br/>The track is not only used to store the items of the still hidden chambers but also to move the cave&acute;s inhabitants through those chambers as well.<br/><br/>During the game when you gradually explore the cave you will fan out the cave tiles along the hidden information track to get a two dimensional representations of the cave that makes all chambers and possible routes between them visible.<br/><br/>The Bears (the AI of the game)<br/>The rumours were right: There is indeed living a bear in this cave &ndash; and not only one, but three..<br/>Those bears will roam the cave while you&acute;re busy exploring.<br/><br/>They are steered by their own desires. Each bear&acute;s desires are represented by a cup filled with wooden cubes of different colours.<br/><br/>Each colour stands for a different desire. The composition of those cubes represents what goes on in the bear&acute;s head and will change during the game according to what that bear experiences. <br/>The bears will either be tired &ndash; doing nothing,  hungry &ndash; searching for food, angry &ndash; looking for things to destroy, or bloodthirsty &ndash; coming for you..!<br/>During the game you will draw cubes form the bear&acute;s cup to determine what the bear wants to do and in which direction and how far it will move.<br/><br/>Yourself and your actions<br/>On your turn you can climb through the cave, open crates, carry and use items. <br/>For all this you need energy. Like the bears you also have a cup with wooden cubes that represent your energy reserve &ndash; and also your fear that will get in the way of your plans from time to time . <br/>Each turn you draw as many energy cubes as you like &ndash; the amount drawn equals the amount of energy you can spend on this turn. But if you draw a black cube you are instantly paralysed with fear. You could still make your body move but only for a certain cost  - or you have to stand still shivering in the dark, hoping that the bears will not find you..<br/><br/>Experience<br/>Certain key moments during your adventure will help you unlock hidden (one time) powers that you never knew to possess.<br/><br/>The Items<br/>Dr Humboldt has stored away his belongings in a huge number of crates that can be found all over the cave. Those crates contain items that will help you survive on your quest. <br/>Some make you stronger, some help you deal with the bears. <br/>But to carry those items around in the narrow cave takes concentration.

This is the domain of Jabba the Hutt, and you&rsquo;ll need to play by his rules if you want to survive.<br/><br/>Jabba&rsquo;s Realm is a new expansion for Imperial Assault that offers a wealth of new content for your campaigns and skirmishes. You&rsquo;ll find an entirely new full-length campaign that challenges you to survive among the desert wastes and criminal underworld of Tatooine, even as new skirmish missions invite you to battle in the Nal Hutta Borderlands or around the fabled Pit of Carkoon.<br/><br/>Eighteen new double-sided map tiles evoke the opening scenes of Return of the Jedi, giving you access for the first time to Jabba&rsquo;s palace, his pleasure barge, and iconic locations like the sarlacc pit. Meanwhile, sixteen brand-new plastic figures offer new warriors and heroes for the Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries, even as new Command cards, Deployment cards, Agenda cards, and Class cards give you countless ways to customize your game. With characters like Jabba the Hutt, the Rancor, and Luke Skywalker as a Jedi Knight joining the game, this expansion draws you into the Star Wars saga like never before.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition", "Polish first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "8.6232", "name": "Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Jabba's Realm", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Role Playing"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "125", "boardgamefamily": ["Star Wars: Imperial Assault"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["26 Devon Dice podcast season 2 Sub Terra, sub DOOM and sub monsters", "Episode 10 - 7 Wonders vs Among the Stars", "Episode 11 - Notre Dame vs Ulm", "Episode 12 - Tammany Hall vs Rialto", "Episode 2 - Quarriors vs Dice Masters", "Episode 7 - Glen More vs Lunarchitects", "Podcast #34 \u2013 Jabba Jetpack", "Podcast #35 \u2013 Aqualish Bowling Ball", "Podcast #36 \u2013 Trade Fair Fever", "Podcast #37 \u2013 Whining Farmboy", "Podcast #38 \u2013 Flame Resistant Dewback", "Podcast #39 \u2013 Allegations of a Cold", "Podcast #40 \u2013 Aqualish for 2", "Podcast #41 \u2013 The Pasi Rule", "Podcast #42 \u2013 The Answer To Life And Possibly Skirmish", "Podcast #43 \u2013 Wookie Hate", "Podcast #44 \u2013 Coughing Contest", "Podcast #46 \u2013 Full of Crumbs", "Special Podcast \u2013 Interview with Paul and Todd of FFG"]}, "205901": {"poll": [], "name": "Pepe Porcupine", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Animals"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["EnsenaSoft"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["UIG Entertainment GmbH"], "description": "Pepe Porcupine hates his job. He works the night shift in a warehouse. Each night he gets instructions about where the crates should go. Then he just has to push them into place. Sounds easy, right?<br/><br/>The style of the puzzles in Pepe Porcupine originates from a Japanese game called Sokoban. Sokoban means warehouse keeper in Japanese. Sokoban is a type of transport puzzle, in which the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a floor or a wall. Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as storage locations.<br/><br/>The player is confined to the board, and may move horizontally or vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes). The player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the square beyond. Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls, and they cannot be pulled. The puzzle is solved when all boxes are at the storage locations.<br/><br/>Join Pepe as he works through 254 crazy block pushing puzzles.

Drawing from the deck can also get you powerful Catastrophe cards, which will help your cat become longer, faster.

Each player takes on the role of a mad scientist, sending minion pawns around the board to collect cards which represent the body parts of fantasy or horror creatures. Each part has specific stats and may provide a unique special ability. Each player then constructs a beast out of these collected parts and can use their assembled beast to score victory points by either defeating other players monsters or by capturing locations in the town centre on the board. The first player to reach 15 victory points wins. Beasts that fall in combat lose one of their limbs, but may have new ones stitched on and be sent back out on to the board.<br/><br/>The town also fights back through a special pawn on the board: the angry mob. Each turn a card is drawn from the villager deck which determines how the mob will act for the turn. Generally these cards strengthen the mob and send it to attack the players beasts and minions as well as occasionally scoring victory points for the board. If the board reaches 15 victory points before any of the players, the villagers have successfully stormed the castles of the mad scientists and the players lose. The players can steal victory points from the board, but this usually requires cooperation between at least 2 players in an otherwise directly competitive game.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2",
