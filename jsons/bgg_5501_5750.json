Vandenbroucke review - <a target='_blank' href='http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt' rel='nofollow'>http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt</a>):<br/><br/>France 1944 (Victory Games) is a Mark Herman design.  It's a 130 counter, 1 map game of the breakout and pursuit across France. Units are divisions, I believe.  Components are up to VG's usual high standards.<br/><br/>Complexity is rated as &quot;low,&quot; and solitaire suitability is &quot;medium.&quot;  The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality.  There is a track display that you use during movement/combat.  As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions.  It's easier to play than it is to describe.<br/><br/>For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.<br/><br/>The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).<br/>Chrome rules cover Market-Garden and the Bulge.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"28191": "Victory Games edition"}, "name": "France 1944: The Allied Crusade in Europe", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": {"2026": "Hex-and-Counter"}, "average": "6.15245", "usersrated": "143", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "age": "12"}, "5657": {"boardgamedesigner": {"6430": {"name": "Ralph Baer"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Maniac", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "1979", "usersrated": "20", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic20962_t.jpg", "average": "4.92", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1997": {"name": "Arxon"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic20962.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"109856": "Ideal Edition 1979"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1072": {"name": "Electronic"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "An electronic game that is actually four games in one.<br/><br/>Each of up to four players has an electronic 'paddle' mounted on the game console.<br/><br/>In the first round, Maniac plays random tones and then suddenly stops.

In late 1940, the Italian Army invaded Egypt beginning the famous North African Campaign of World War II. After a short withdrawal, the Commonwealth forces counterattacked and all but threw the Italians back to Tripoli. Not content to let his southern partner bring disgrace to the Axis arms, Hitler dispatched a German contingent under a new commander: Erwin Rommel. His arrival began a rapid mobile campaign across the rocky sands.  However, by the end of 1942, Rommel had failed in his final bid to seize the Nile Delta and was thrown completely out of the theater by Montgomery's pursuit after El Alamein. Axis fortunes would never rise on the African continent again.<br/><br/>Afrika is a fast paced game of mobile warfare at the operational level. Can you take the Nile? Can your Commonwealth forces kick the Axis armor out of Egypt for good?  This game gives you the tools to find out. The game's easy-to-use supply system (no writing) allows for a correct logistical aspect to the game.<br/><br/>This is the second game in Standard Combat Series by The Gamers that began with the game Stalingrad Pocket.

The goal in both editions is to win the vote, which occurs when all the states have at least one candidate in it and someone rolls doubles. The player who has the most counties in any given state wins all the electoral votes from that state; in case of a tie, the player who reached the total first wins the state. If one player does not have a majority of electoral votes (269), only the two players with the highest votes continue - the rest are eliminated. It continues until another official vote is taken and a winner is determined.<br/><br/>In the 1935 edition, campaigning is conducted via a mix of dice rolls and speech cards.  Players are given money and three speech cards at the beginning of the game, and whenever 7 or 11 is rolled an additional speech card is auctioned.  Speech cards give players a small number of counties in specific states, allowing players to more effectively focus their campaigning and make comebacks.  On a turn, players roll three dice.  The dice (all the same color) are summed, and the total can be used to campaign in each of the 48 states.  Small states - those with 3 to 5 electoral votes - take only 1 point to win a county, while larger states require as many as nine points to win a county.<br/><br/>The 1952 edition is significantly simplified.  On a player's turn, the player rolls 3 dice (1 colored, 2 white) - the colored dice tells the player which states to be worked in this turn and the white dice tells the player how many &quot;counties&quot; (4-7 in each state) they win.<br/><br/>"}, "5715": {"boardgamedesigner": {"11609": {"name": "Arnaud de Rosnay"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Petropolis", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "1976", "usersrated": "106", "boardgamefamily": {"11519": "Oil, Gas, and Petroleum"}, "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic21276_t.jpg", "average": "5.3184", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4680": {"name": "Borras Plana S.A."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic21276.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"39507": "Borras Plana Spanish edition"}, "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "age": "9", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>An exciting game about the fortunes of oil: From 2 to 7 players compete for the thrills of being an oil tycoon.<br/><br/>The object of the game [is] to acquire concessions in the petroleum producing countries, control them and operate them.

Then there are a few other spaces that give allow either specific actions like buying/selling mutual funds, or make you draw a random event or a stock manipulation card. Stocks are bought buy mainly landing on one of the 3 spaces of a corporation's home, or buy landing on a mutual fund space. If you own 3 stoacks of a corporation you become its president and can pay out dividends to stockholders, or can merge corporations thus increasing stock prices. Other things that can happen are takeovers - forcing a resident to sell you his shares, options - a chance to buy shares from the bank or another player for 1/2 price.

Play progresses with the gamer on offense calling his play (run or pass, where the play is directed, the ball carrier or primary receiver, etc.) and the gamer on defense setting a defensive configuration (blitzes, double coverage of receivers, stacking the line, etc.).  In the cards and dice version, three dice are then rolled, with one die determining whether the play result comes from the offensive or defensive cards and the other two determining the result from the speciifed card.  Play takes place on a game board that resembles a football field, and the gamers keep track of the ball position, the down, and the time remaining in the quarter being played.  Penalties and injuries are part of the game.  Gamers play from the perspective of a head coach and/or general manager.<br/><br/>The game also comes in a computer version that automatically determines play outcomes and compiles and reports player, team and league statistics.

You can buy add-ons to the home base of your mining company that can do numerous things for you.  Things that increase income, security, etc.<br/><br/>Many battles take place in the corridors of the mines, but the battle can be taken to a player's home base if needed.  As such, players map out their home bases as they purchase rooms (e.g. jails, vaults, storage, etc), fortifications (e.g. gates, walls, traps, etc), and other assorted upgrades on to them.<br/><br/>RAFM has released other races to play, including Orcs, Undead, and &quot;Reptiliads&quot; (lizard men) to name a few.

For the basic game, players take turns to make an attack by scratching away a panel of their rival to reveal the symbol underneath. When enough wound symbols were found, one of the fighter's 'life' panels would be uncovered and a skull symbol signified his defeat. The dead fighter card would then be given to the winning player who could use the card's 'purse' (an amount of gold listed in the corner) to purchase 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by mailing Merlin with gold equal to the price agreed on a Trading Post card.<br/><br/>Quest cards normally required collectors to study their cards carefully then send the correct ones to Merlin so they could claim a reward of gold. For example, to claim a token worth 100 gold, St. Charity's Quest required you to collect five men with no gold in their purses, which obviously required you to defeat them first.

They depict specific situations of crucial parts of the war<br/>2)The Campaign Game: It combines the four afforementioned games and fill in the gaps so that the campaign can be played out in sequence<br/>3)The Variable situations: Several &quot;what if&quot; historical effects are examined when added to the above games.<br/><br/>The Game includes a 23&quot; by 29&quot; map sheet that portrays the area os the Soviet Union in which the operations took place.<br/>A hexagonal grid is superimposed upon the map to regularize the movement and the position of the playing pieces.<br/>The combat map is all inclusive with a Terrain Effects Chart (TEC) and Combat Results Table(CRT)<br/>There are two types of units each repressenting one of the opposing armies.Each piece is distinguished by type strenght nationality and mobolity.<br/><br/>How To Play<br/>Each player moves his Units and executes attacks in turn.Players have as an objective to destroy the enemy units and gaining territory whilst minimizing friendly unit loses.<br/>The combat is resolved by comparing attack and defence strengths of adjacent opposing units and expressing the comparison as a simplified probability ratio(odds)<br/>After the defender has chosen which CRT table will be used a die is rolled and the outcome indicated by cross referencing the die roll result and the odds column is applied to the unit being attacked.<br/>Barbarossa is played in turns.<br/>Each Game-turn is composed of two player turns that are divided into three phases.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"251973": "Boxed Edition"}, "name": "Barbarossa: The Russo-German War 1941-45", "playingtime": "360", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "14", "usersrated": "91", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "average": "6.37033"}, "5542": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Bamboozle", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "1962", "usersrated": "8", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic310001_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"20": {"name": "Milton Bradley"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic310001.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"115489": "Milton Bradley First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>Bamboozle - The Hide and Seek game with McKeever and the Colonel as seen on NBC TV.<br/><br/>The game board is a symmetric 'battlefield', each side containing 6 huts connected by pathways.

To triumph over your rivals, you will need to explore the labyrinth of corridors, defeat the heinous monsters, overcome nefarious traps and be the first to complete all your Quests. But beware, the gods are fickle and to test their Heroes even further, they often bestow upon them Banes as well as Boons.<br/><br/>Game Description:<br/><br/>This simple card game is very reminiscent of Wiz-War. Players are dealt one of 4 Heroes, each with varying movement, fighting and magic abilities. The Dwarf for example is very tough, but has no magic value at all. Each Hero also has a value for hit points, the amount of Treasure he can have (carry) at any time and also the number of &quot;Boons&quot; (special abilities) he may have. Players are dealt 3 quest cards initially in front of them (public knowledge) and have 5 Adventure cards in hand.<br/><br/>Each turn a player may:<br/><br/>     Discard unwanted cards and draw back to 5 cards.<br/>     Play Encounters and/or Bane cards (always on opponents never on yourself).<br/>     Build the Dungeon.<br/>     Move (collect Peril and Glory tokens).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Players will collect Peril tokens as they move which then makes them targets for others to play Encounter/Bane cards against them (Encounter/Bane cards have a fee to play - which is paid for by the person who the card is played ON with Peril tokens). This  simple mechanic balances the game by spreading the attacks around as you can't attack someone that can't pay the Peril price.<br/><br/>Players attempt various quests (some are simple die rolls in a certain room, some are tough combat and some a series of things to do), with each completed quest having your Hero &quot;go up a level&quot; which increases his abilities.<br/><br/>Treasures &amp; Boons help you, Banes, Traps &amp; Encounters hurt you (which are played on you by other players).<br/><br/>The dungeon map is different each time as it is made up of cards played one at time onto the table by each player.<br/><br/>This game was introduced at DunDraCon 2003, in San Ramon, Ca. There are several planned expansions, and two special cards available by mail if you purchased at the convention.<br/><br/>First game in the Dungeoneer Series.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"24273": "Atlas English edition 2.1"}, "average": "6.11245", "name": "Dungeoneer: Tomb of the Lich Lord", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2001": "Action Point Allowance System"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "2300", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5496": "Thematic Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"31": "Dungeoneer"}}, "5577": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1216": {"name": "Seven Towns"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Frog Soccer", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1992", "usersrated": "10", "boardgamefamily": {"6994": "Animals: Frogs"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic190414_t.jpg", "average": "3.91", "statistics": {}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"4665": "Children's Games"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic190414.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"139489": "Jumbo Dutch edition 1995"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamepublisher": {"335": {"name": "Jumbo"}}, "boardgamecategory": {"1032": {"name": "Action / Dexterity"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Each player controls a frog and attempts to shoot the soccer ball into their colored net across from them.
