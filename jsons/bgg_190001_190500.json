Following the breakout of the US Third Army from Normandy and its drive across France, Patton&rsquo;s forces had fought hard and victoriously. However, by the end of September shortages of fuel and ammunition forced General Dwight D. Eisenhower to order a halt. Those supplies that did get through were diverted to British General Bernard Montgomery&rsquo;s forces to the north for the upcoming Market-Garden offensive. Frustrated, Patton ordered a &ldquo;reconnaissance in force&rdquo; to take Fort Driant, the last German-held position barring Third Army&rsquo;s way to Metz.<br/><br/>Believing the fortress to be held only by rear echelon personnel and demoralized remnants of units that had retreated into its works, Patton felt the position could be easily taken by a reinforced battalion of the 11th Regiment of the 5th US Infantry Division (nicknamed the &ldquo;Red Diamonds&rdquo;), the only unit he could provide sufficient fuel and ammo to continue offensive operations. However, the German garrison was well prepared to resist, with elements of the 17th SS (Kiss My Ass) division nearby for support.<br/><br/>In actuality the US forces attacking Fort Driant would be outnumbered and outgunned. The ten day battle that raged at Fort Driant was marked by bloody and fierce fighting that at times was waged hand-to-hand and both sides calling in &ldquo;final protective fire&rdquo; upon their own positions. In the end the 5th Infantry&rsquo;s &ldquo;blood and guts&rdquo; would not be enough, and Patton would order his only retreat of the war from Fort Driant.

Entire epic battles are represented; no longer must the players extrapolate the results of the entire battle of Waterloo based upon their game's recreation of the fight for the garden gate at Hougoumont. Players represent the highest level leaders in any given battle, and as such make the decisions that will shape the entire battle. Gone are the minutiae which their historical counterparts left to their subordinates, your focus is on your army's brigades, not on the battalions and squadrons.<br/><br/>Decisions made by lower level officers are abstracted into the mechanics of the game, players should understand that there is someone at the lower level who should be taking care of those details (spacing of battalions and squadrons, deployment of skirmishers, sighting of artillery sections, availability of spare ammunition, etc).  Like it or not the real commanders had to trust subordinates to do their duty well. Often these abstract subordinates will make mistakes (represented by bad dice rolls), whether or not your subordinate's failure is catastrophic to your plan will depend on the allowances you have made for that possibility. This of course is a good reason to have plenty of reserves available.<br/><br/>And speaking of reserves, the most unique aspect of Commit the Garde! is the use of off-table reserves.  No longer can your opponent see the deployment of your entire army. The location of your reserves is not determined until you commit them to the battle, at which time you place them where you want them (with limitations based upon distance from your Army HQ and proximity of enemy forces). The skill of your army commander and staff determine how effectively you can commit your reserves.<br/><br/>The game is played on a hex-grid map; the reason for this is to remove the ambiguities of &quot;free movement&quot; common to most miniature rules.  With hexes there is no doubt about a unit's location, it's facing, and what the range is to any other unit on the battlefield.  The intent with this approach is to make this a game/simulation of decisions, not of inches.<br/><br/>"}, "190036": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2803135.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Marc Andr\u00e9"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015"], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Asmodee", "Frosted Games", "Space Cowboys"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2803135_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Economic", "Expansion for Base-game", "Renaissance"], "description": "Contained in Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015 for Day 16.<br/><br/>This special noble Patron can be used in any game of Splendor.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "average": "7.22436", "name": "Splendor: Special Noble Patron", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Set Collection"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "78", "boardgamefamily": ["Splendor"]}, "190037": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jake Zhong"], "rpg": ["Clown Helsing"], "poll": [], "name": "Clown Helsing", "rpgartist": ["Jake Zhong"], "rpgproducer": ["Jake Zhong"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2803605.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Comedy / Satire", "Mythology / Folklore", "Weird / Surreal"], "rpgpublisher": ["TopSecret Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["Two-Page Tabletop Competition"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2803605_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>In the game, the game master is known as the RingMaster and is in charge of the Vampire, the Scenery, and Bystanders.

Thanks to a hidden key in the yard you can at least enter the house and call your parents. Well, there was a misunderstanding with your aunt. There is Pizza in the freezer. Wait until tomorrow morning and please, please don&rsquo;t do anything stupid.<br/>Alone at your aunt&rsquo;s mansion the fun stops during a snowball fight as you eavesdrop on a conversation of what seems to be a corrupt cop. He talks to a friend on the police radio: It&rsquo;s like a ghost town here &ndash; nobody is around, the ideal time and place for burglary. He agrees with the other person to meet<br/>here at dawn &ndash; right before your aunt&rsquo;s house &ndash; to rob the neighborhood.<br/>You call your parents again, but they don&rsquo;t seem to believe your childish stories. Instead they order you to not go to the police as it might look bad: Why are there kids in a house without supervision?

No one could have imagined the hideous side effects. The first effect was that many of the papayas grew to enormous size and absorbed tons of atmospheric CO2. This CO2 reservoir ended global warming trends, if they ever existed in the first place. The second, and even more shocking, effect was that people born to consumers of the papayas often developed superpowers. I mean these things are complicated and the earth did pass through the tail of a radioactive comet that night when all cactuses became sentient. But most people are pretty sure it&rsquo;s the papayas. When will people learn?<br/>While most of those developing super powers led the lives of normal, law abiding citizens 0.1% turned towards lives of crime (as high as 0.3% in some groups of minorities). Thus the US department of homeland security was forced to put together teams of super powered people to deal with these threats. Threats not just to safety and property, but threats to the American way of life itself.  <br/>You are heroes because you are on this team.

But the evil wizard Captious grew jealous and cursed each of the five farmlands. The food grew to a monstrous size and began to attack the village. The people had only a limited supply of cannonballs to defend themselves against the humongous food! Thankfully a giant from the land of Epicure volunteered to guard the village and eat any food that got too close to the village - even though it was food that giants didn't normally eat. The wizard's magic is limited so your challenge is to defend your village until it runs out.<br/><br/>This is a co-op game designed to be played together by a parent and one child. The game contains a single-sheet board, tokens, and a small deck of cards. Players will also need to provide one 6-sided die and about 10 small candies or snacks that the child likes to eat such as M&amp;Ms, Fruit Snacks, or Fish Crackers. The parent should also choose five foods that they would like the child to try eating. I recommend choosing one food from each of the five food groups but any combination of foods will work.<br/><br/>Each section of the board contains a track leading towards the village and is marked by an icon of one of the five food groups. Before the game, assign one of the five foods to each track (markers are provided to help you remember which food is on which track). Each turn, players will draw a card from the deck that will indicate what tracks are attacking the village that turn. Move that marker one space down the track.<br/><br/>The village can defend itself by rolling a die and trying to get a higher number than the advancing token. At any time, the player may use one of their &quot;cannonballs&quot; (candies) to automatically win a battle. If they use a cannonball it is lost forever (the parent gets to eat it).<br/><br/>The giant marker can move along the red line between the &quot;1&quot; spaces. If a giant and a food monster are ever in the same space, the giant may immediately remove that piece by eating it. The child must taste the associated food for this action. The child can push back the food monsters by tasting the associated food.<br/><br/>If any food monster is ever able to enter the village it squishes all the villagers, the game is lost, and the cannonballs are lost (the parent gets to eat them). If the child is able to defend the village until the draw deck is empty, he or she gets to eat all the remaining candy cannonballs as a reward.<br/><br/>This game is inspired by Israeli Independence by Darin A.

This PDF contains two new amazing gadgets for a Savage Worlds steampunk game, plus characters and adventure seeds to fuel your imagination! Although written for Savage Worlds and The Widening Gyre, these amazing wonders are easy to port over into any system or setting that you can imagine.<br/><br/>During the Franco-Prussian War of 1862-1870, marauding armies overran many small towns and villages. In order to protect themselves, one town came upon a novel solution. Instead of trying to defend itself (a losing proposition to be certain), it would use the age-old solution: run away from danger. Using the latest technology and supported by several brilliant Savants, they put legs on their town, making it mobile. Soon, other towns followed the first one&rsquo;s lead and now there are many walking towns.<br/><br/>Walking towns are slow and ponderous and make a tremendous amount of noise, but they are simply amazing to witness. In the years since the wars, many of them have settled down in fertile areas, never to move again unless danger looms. Others have become something like gypsy towns, packing up and moving on every few months. Legend says that there are walking ghost-towns as well; mechanized villages which roam during fog-shrouded nights, or silhouetted by the flickering lighting during terrible thunderstorms. Much like the legendary Flying Dutchman of the high seas, these haunted places are seen as an evil omen, bringing bad luck wherever they are seen.<br/><br/>"}, "190119": {"rpgdesigner": ["Steven J.

The British army under Sir John Stuart defeated the French troops of Jean Louis Reynier. Outcome of battle was decided by British infantry attack on bayonets, preceded by effective rifle volley. Rules focus on infantry tactics.<br/>One battalion is represented by 4 counters. The player determines which order to use at any given time. Various types of orders are represented by different icons. After the change of formation, the players put on the board counter with the corresponding icon. The exception is the square - here we use the auxiliary marker.<br/>The battalion can be formed into a column to the bayonet charge or the line to effectively use firepower. The line order is represented by a square and rectangular counters, if a unit was large enough.<br/>The player can detach a company of tirailleurs, which is represented by a separate counter.<br/>The battle of Maida is regarded by historians as an example of the superiority of the British two ranks line over the &quot;classic&quot; three ranks line. This difference is also reflected in the game. Firepower is expressed as a percentage, which depends on the size. In the case of the British army is 100% - all soldiers can shoot. In the French is 66% - efficient fire through two of the three ranks. For the infantry in column formation or square it is always a 20%. In the case of tirailleurs and artillery on counters are given immediately the effect of fire - a morale check and modifiers for distance, if any.<br/>In the battle only two units of the French cavalry took part. They exist in a double-row line and because of the tactics used (rapid charge) can not fire.<br/>Due to the historical course of the battle, the aspect of command is very simplified. One player draws one commander from a pool (common to both players). Units within its range can move, and further order of shooting is determined (inactive player fires first). Of course, in certain situations very big significance is who will be able to move their troops. The drawing is intended to represent a situation where one of the leaders taking the initiative, and another in spite of favorable circumstances behave passively. In fact, all commanders were on the same level and you can not distinguish any leader that was better than the others.<br/>During the movement the enemy can react. Units with high morale have better chance that they fire, and maybe even counterattack. However, there is always a risk that our soldiers leave the battlefield in a panic escape. That's what happened to experienced Reynier&rsquo;s veterans.<br/>During the game, the most common procedure is the fire that causes morale check. Each unit (except for artillery and commanders) has a proper rating on a counter. The test is successful when a modified roll of a 10-sided dice is less than or equal to the rating.<br/>Rule book has 12 pages. Many of the rules describe special situations that can happen during gameplay, for example commander participating in bayonet charge. Basic, most commonly used procedures are very simple. Another advantage is the small amount of counters and a simple overall situation. A challenge for the players is the use of their forces at the right time and in proper order. Experienced players should be enough 3 hours for the entire play.<br/><br/>"}, "190130": {"rpgdesigner": ["Chris Conn", "Manuel Joaquin"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "10 Dragonborn Backgrounds", "rpgartist": ["Jeff Preston"], "rpgproducer": ["Chris Conn", "Manuel Joaquin"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2938997.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dragon Sun Game Company"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2938997_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Backgrounds grant you the ability to customize your character even further by suggesting ideas for your character&rsquo;s history.

Snow storms, freezing cold and icy winds produce a difficult environment - but also hardy and resourceful people. Snorri Silverspine, an adventurer keen to retire, happened to make camp in the ruins of an old fort. Making a fire in the lee of a crumbling wall, he wished there was a tavern he could sit and warm up in. And then he decided - he'd come back and build a tavern. A few years later, and travellers in the bleak wilderness were grateful to come across a tavern and a warm welcome, with Snorri at the helm. Time passed, and a few more houses appeared beside the tavern and the road, and visitors started calling the settlement 'Ysenthorp'. As for Snorri, he was happy to call himself a tavernkeep - he'll be happy to call himself 'Mayor of Ysenthorp' soon too..<br/><br/><br/>A printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game.

Evening is falling, and warm yellow light spills from the windows of the tavern and houses into the snowy streets. The hamlet is surrounded by a forest of evergreen trees, and built in the crumbling remnants of an ancient fort.<br/><br/>"}, "190178": {"statistics": [], "name": "Amazon Fire TV Controller", "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Controller"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "poll": [], "videogamehwversion": ["Amazon Fire TV Controller (Fire TV with 4K Ultra HD Compatible Only)"], "videogamehwmfg": ["Amazon"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A game controller for the Amazon Fire TV.<br/><br/>"}, "190179": {"rpgdesigner": ["Paris E.

Players will move pawns through nodes and pathways on a board representing Ancient Athens. Landing on event spaces will allow players to draw and play from nine different decks of cards, with each card containing both historically and philosophically flavored text and mechanics to implement in-game. Additionally, some spaces will grant players access to various in-game functions, such as a market to buy and sell item cards, a gymnasium to restore health or a temple to supplicate and bid for the help of the gods.<br/><br/>The goal of the game internally is to be the player with the most virtue points. Virtue points are earned by triumphing over other players in the in-game battle system, Dialectics; successfully completing events; recruiting pupils; being in possession of specific items.<br/><br/>While dice rolling will determine successes and failures in the game's event trials, pupil recruitment and actions in battle, players may tilt the odds in their favor when they allocate more of their virtue points to whichever statistic or trait (depicted by the four Socratic Virtues in-game), wager or sacrifice unallocated virtue points for a temporary advantage or collect the abilities of various pupils and items in the game.<br/><br/>And taken from the back of the game's box:<br/><br/>Philosophy is a way of life and the sweetest of the Muses. She importunes you to seek excellence in virtue and cultivate your body and soul. Explore the Classical and Hellenistic periods of Ancient Greece along with its rich Traditions and charismatic Mythos, as you take part in Dialectical arguments in search of Truth, participate in the bustling civic life of Athens, and travel outside of your Mother City seeking opportunities to exercise your Wisdom and practice your Craft on. Aiding you in your Homeric quest for Socratic virtue are loyal pupils, capricious gods and your soul's affinity with the ordered cosmos.

Sans Alli&eacute;s takes the feel of a grand-strategy, area-movement war game and compresses it into a tight little solo package, playable in about an hour.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/>The enemy nation is represented by an assortment of &quot;region&quot; cards arranged as a layered pyramid, with the &quot;enemy capital&quot; card at the top of the pyramid.  Meanwhile, the enemy's &quot;progress&quot; towards completion of an ultimate weapon is represented by a proximity track along the side of the pyramid, which possibly increases each turn.  The object of the game is to capture or claim the enemy capital card before the enemy succeeds in completing his weapon.<br/><br/>No region card can be removed from the pyramid until either one or both of the cards laid atop it are removed first.  Therefore, you will need to capture region cards at the lowest level of the pyramid first, working your way up the pyramid in stages.  Each attempt to capture a region is called an &quot;invasion.&quot; To conduct invasions, you gather various military unit cards from your draw deck (separate from the enemy nation deck).  These units have strength values, while each level of the pyramid has a defensive value.  You have to amass enough strength and the right types of units to attempt an invasion on a given region, and then a roll of the dice determines whether you lose (discard) this entire invasionary force, or save a few, or lose more than expected, and are possibly forced to retreat.<br/><br/>Along the way, you can capture select region cards called resource centers, and/or you can invade select zones to liberate prison camps.  These achievements not only increase the number of cards you draw on a turn, but also grant you the ability to improve your units strength values, and they introduce tactical developments that give you more dynamic choices in battle, including an Ultimate Weapon of your own.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.35785", "name": "Sans Alli\u00e9s", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Modular Board"], "age": "8", "usersrated": "65", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Episode #6 \u2013 Sans Allies", "Low Player Count - Ep 24 - Card Drafting"]}, "190267": {"rpgdesigner": ["Matthew Finch", "Bill Webb"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "statistics": [], "name": "Bill Webb's Book of Dirty Tricks", "rpgartist": ["Brian LeBlanc", "Artem Shukaev"], "rpgproducer": ["Matthew Finch", "Skeeter Green", "Charles Wright (I)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2885304.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Saddle Stitched Softcover Version"], "average": "6", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Frog God Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2885304_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's Blurb:<br/><br/>This fun little tome is a GM utility for use during regular play when either too many good things happen to the players due to luck or just whenever the GM feels they need a little push to remind them that success is fleeting.<br/><br/>Dirty tricks are intended to create great players.

Unfortunately, certain aspects of the game that were made before the introduction of psychic magic, which could not have been predicted at the time they were made, are incompatible with this new type of magic. One such aspect was prestige classes, where prerequisites often required arcane or divine spellcasting specifically, such as with the arcane archer and the mystic theurge. While many GM's could simply rewrite the prerequisites if they chose, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to make some brand new prestige classes that specifically captured the psychic and occult flavor.<br/><br/>This book contains four new prestige classes for psychic spellcasters. The component artist blends arcane and psychic magic, in the style of the mystic theurge, but gains the ability to substitute one type of components for another, and gains benefits when casting spells with certain components. The dark mind infiltrator mixes physical stealth with psychic sneakiness, and specializes in warping the perceptions of their targets. The focused blade blends psychic powers and physical prowess, making powerful psychic strikes and using his blade to distract opponents from dangerous psychic assaults. Finally, the psychic intercessor finds common ground between psychic and divine magic, tapping into the will of the multiverse to invoke powerful divine interventions.<br/><br/>"}, "190271": {"average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Bugs Bunny's Christmas Game", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System"], "yearpublished": "1951", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamefamily": ["Characters: Bugs Bunny", "Holidays: Christmas"], "boardgameartist": ["Tony Strobl"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Dell Publishing Co., Inc."], "boardgameversion": ["Bugs Bunny's Christmas Game 1951 Edition", "Bugs Bunny's Christmas Game 1952 Edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Humor", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "Dell printed different versions of this game in the first two issues of Bugs Bunny's Christmas Funnies in 1951 and 1952.

Find employees by searching through resumes. Each resume is randomly generated with names, old jobs, education and more. Each one of these individually affects that employee&rsquo;s &ldquo;ability skill&rdquo;. That skill is much needed in many situations. If a customer comes in knowing what phone they want and you have it in stock, a salesman with a higher ability will be able to sell them on the accessories they need, driving up the profits on that sale. If you don&rsquo;t have a phone in inventory, a higher ability is going to be needed to persuade a customer into a phone you do have in stock, and ensure they are going to keep it without returning it later.<br/><br/>You have full control over the inventory! Every day you must order new phones to keep your inventory fresh for the customers! A new phone comes out that&rsquo;s a dud? Well you better discount it to get it off the shelves! As it stands right now there are 16 different phones for customers to choose, all from 8 different manufacturers divided up into three different OSs. There are accessories made for each phone and the player can decide how hard they would like their game to be. The player can choose to control all accessories down to which ones product by product, or if they don&rsquo;t like that amount of micromanagement they can choose to instead just buy a bulk of accessories that work for every phone.<br/><br/>The customers come into the store, most with an idea of the type of phone they want. Customers can have their mind changed on what to purchase, but if they don&rsquo;t like it they will come back and return their purchase. Each customer has their own unique name and data to keep track of. Keep those customers happy and they will tell their friends about your location. Other customer traffic is based on advertising campaigns that you as manager must select. Peak customer hours change frequently so you better be on top of the schedule.<br/><br/>In the beginning you are running a small shop that can hold four employees. Two of them can be working at a time. There is one opening shift and one closing shift. Don&rsquo;t neglect your workers by not scheduling them, and on the contrary don&rsquo;t over work them. Doing these things might get them fed up just enough to quit! You must schedule your employees correctly from the time they come in, to the time they break, to the time they leave. But be careful! Schedule breaks during peak customer times and the employee might not get to break that day, resulting in a fine for you!<br/><br/>As you gain profits it is up to you to upgrade all the displays and looks around the store to drive up customer ratings, giving more free word of mouth advertising which drives up revenue! You can upgrade individual displays as well as things like the desks up front your employees stand behind, the flooring and more! This isn't all for aesthetics. Customers like clean and modern stores! The better it looks, the more money they might be willing to spend! Gain enough money and maybe you can even move into that new huge retail space they just built across town!

Servants of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and harbingers of famine, death, disease, and war, daemons occupy an interesting middle ground between the calculating and insidious devils and the ravening and savage demons. They truly want what's worst for everyone, with a nihilistic amorality that embodies every awful instance and element of death, pain, suffering, grief, and loss in living form. There is no peace, no hope, no light, no faith, no favor, and no escape. Only an inexorable grinding down to nothingness will satisfy their entropic appetites. From CR 3 to 22, we bring you dangerous daemons of every description, from minor magical minions like the cacodaemon, venedaemon, and ceustodaemon that might answer the call of mortal summons thinking their mystical might makes them masters of the lowest servants of Abaddon, to the guardians and masters of the River Styx, the hungry hydrodaemons and the cadaverous thanadaemons. The latter deacons of death are joined in the hierarchy of Hades by the leukodaemon spreaders of pestilence, the meladaemons, scions of starvation, and the purrodaemon warbringers. Some daemons seem almost alien, like the insane insectoid derghodaemons and the tentacular planewalking astradaemons, but all live for the thrill of the kill, whether as brutish bruisers like the piscodaemon or the seemingly forlorn yet fearsome vulnudaemon. As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the mighty and megalomaniacal ignodaemons are formed from fallen souls of earthly despots who incarnated to evil now govern fiefs of their lesser kin in an elaborate feudal tyranny in the service of the daemonic deacons and harbingers, balancing subtle skills of sedition with the brutal fist of power. The cruelty of these evil overlords is revealed in short fiction from Todd Stewart, in an interview with the archdaemon of poisons and incurable affliction, with every ophidian utterance envenomed with evil.<br/><br/>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they&rsquo;ve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and &ldquo;What was THAT?&rdquo; will warm any GM&rsquo;s heart.<br/><br/>This all-new 30-page supplement is a terrific complement to the Mythic Monster Manual, with over 220 mythic monsters and an awesome array of monster-focused abilities, feats, and more for your Pathfinder game!<br/><br/>"}, "190294": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "So Now You're a Time Traveller", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2809880.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Time / Dimension Travel)"], "rpgpublisher": ["TopSecret Games"], "rpg": ["So Now You're a Time Traveller"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["Two-Page Tabletop Competition"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2809880_t.jpg", "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>Characters in the game do not have traditional Attributes or Skills.

Their cabinet made that decision based on a report from the Finance Ministry stating the cost of such a move would force them to take the franc off the gold standard and let it float. When the US and British governments, along with those two nations' banking industries, declined to extend the line of credit that would've been needed in order to head off such a potentially panic-inducing economic development, the French decided they couldn't afford to act. The alternative outcome examined here, then, is based on the idea the French either got the loan they needed, or perhaps simply decided the Nazi regime in Germany represented too large a threat to the future of their own republic for it to be allowed to go on unchecked.<br/><br/>More particularly, the scenario starts with the French having mobilized and marched across the Rhineland, stopping at the river. (Historically, the German forces involved in the remilitarization moved across the Rhine bridges with orders to turn about and withdraw immediately if the French advanced.) The further idea is that, within a few hours or days of the French advance, Hitler and his cronies are either dead, jailed or in hiding, due to a Putsch headed by elements within the German military high command. The Nazi Party breaks into factions and starts to war against itself, or simply falls apart into political incoherency. The concentration caps are soon opened by riots among the prisoners within, or perhaps are liberated by angry mobs from without. Either way, the upshot is that all the earlier-imprisoned leaders of Germany's left-wing parties are suddenly back on the political stage.<br/><br/>In Moscow, Stalin quickly comes to understand the opportunity -- likely to be brief -- being presented to him. He announces to the Supreme Soviet the era of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; has ended just as suddenly as it began. The time has instead come to forge the iron of international revolution while it is newly hot. &quot;On to Berlin and Socialist World Revolution!&quot; becomes the new slogan of the day. Of course, the Poles resist the effort of the Red Army to cut through their country on its way west.<br/><br/>Thus, within a month or so after their initial intervention, the French must reconcile themselves to the fact that, having come in for a sou they are now irretrievably in for a franc. As the German army begins to fall apart into warring camps (the &quot;Reds&quot; and the &quot;Nationalists&quot;), Paris sends forward its ponderous Rhineland Army Group this time headed for Berlin, there to create a dictat settlement with a new German government of French choosing.<br/><br/>The orders of battle for all participants in the game are accurate as to their historic composition in the early spring of 1936. The only Soviet corps left out are the one they then had in the Trans-Caucasus and the two in the Far East. Further, the Red Army purges hadn't yet begun, so three large mechanized corps are available, along with he world's first paratroop unit as well as its largest cavalry arm.<br/><br/>The first three panzer divisions (all with only Mark I Panzers) start in their countryside training areas, as does the experimental 4th Assault Gun Brigade, which was then dedicated solely to infantry support. The dozen German infantry corps, all of which had historically just completed a rushed year of training (literally and figuratively conducted at &quot;double-time&quot; over the normal two-year cycle), after Hitler's nullification of the army's size limit set by Versailles, are in their Wehrkreis mobilization centers.

The Second Great War erupted in August 1940, with Serbian, Russian, French and Italian armies attacking the Central Powers in a naked grab for territory and power.<br/><br/>Armies and fleets were not the only forces the aggressors deployed. Along the broad Danube River, the Austrian flotilla fought to keep their Serbian enemies from pushing upstream into the heart of the Monarchy. The armored riverine warships, known as monitors, featured heavy guns and thick armor, in effect small battleships maximized for the river environment. But Serbia had built its own fleet of river vessels, as had their ally, Romania.<br/><br/>River Fleets introduces these armored warships to Panzer Grenadier. It&rsquo;s part of our Second Great War setting. There are 68 new playing pieces: 20 double-sized river monitors, and 48 standard-sized ones for smaller craft plus troops and leaders. There are also two new 11x17-inch maps showing the beautiful blue Danube in its full watery glory.

Players are forced to make difficult trade-offs between expending resources in the Political Phase vs the Action Phase and attempting to influence one faction at the expense of others. Players utilize a shared deck of 66 Political Cards.<br/><br/>During the Action Phase, players use Action Cards to conduct operations (activating a space for combat or movement), take replacements, place reinforcements, make strategic moves, seize initiative in combat, gain diplomatic traction with the factions or implement special operations. Leaders have these capabilities including exploitation, reinforcing battles, withdrawing, counter-attacking and conducting multi-space attacks. Players are forced to make difficult decisions thwarting threats and capitalizing on opportunities. Each player has their own deck of 55 Action Cards. Additionally, a deck of 44 Leader Cards (for a combined total of 220 ToC Cards) provide historical details regarding the various personalities in the game.<br/><br/>During the Logistics Phase, players rebuild/repair units, determine if various factions withdraw from the combat, check for the effect of In-Fighting within the RED and WHITE camps, check for attrition, purchase political influence, buy leaders and check for victory.<br/><br/>So, how does Triumph of Chaos v2 compare with v1 (which was published back in 2005 and then expanded in 2007 by the Comrades' Guide)? The categories of improvement:<br/><br/>* A richer game experience&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>     More card angst/decision tension: Significant revisions to the Action Cards (the majority of them) to reflect learnings from new research and hopefully make the choices faced by each player more gut wrenching. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Invited the Socialist Revolutionaries to the party: The SRs now occupy a &ldquo;buffer position&rdquo; between RED &amp; WHITE in the east as the game begins; making for a nail-biting opening. The SRs may go either way as governed by a track and play of both Political and Action cards with significant ramifications for both players. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Leader state: A few leaders now have an alternative &ldquo;state&rdquo; (ex: Kolchak: drug abuse, Mai-Mavesky: debauchery, etc), making them more unreliable than your usual wargame leader counter. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Far east part of the story added: Japan, far-east warlords and red partisans are all now apart of play. <br/><br/><br/>* A little less clunky game engine&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>     A few tweaks to the basic game engine: artillery, tanks and air are now simply &ldquo;assets&rdquo; that modify combat die rolls. A Resource Center mechanic now controls where replacements may be spent (much more reflective of historic constraints). <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Infighting: Gameplay impacts the composition of each player&rsquo;s in-fighting pool; changing the internal political dynamics that both players must manage. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Better Faction rules: A streamlining of the Ukraine and Poland rules. Nips and tucks to Makhno, West Ukraine and Finland. <br/><br/><br/>* ..and improved kit &amp; bits (game look &amp; feel)<br/><br/><br/>     Doubled the map: Most of that is a result of simply &ldquo;blowing up&rdquo; the original map by 40% (for our tired/old eyes) and adding the Far East and Trans-Siberian railroad all the way to glorious Vladivostok. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Bigger counters: Armies &amp; leaders are now represented by &frac12; in x 1 in counters (basically double the size as before), while corps have 5/8 in counters and only informational markers get the wargame traditionally small &frac12; in counters. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Bigger &amp; better game aids: Faction Control Table larger and contains better information regarding the factions&hellip;force composition charts now provided&hellip;and more!<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "0", "name": "Triumph of Chaos v2 DELUXE!", "playingtime": "600", "boardgamemechanic": ["Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Hex-and-Counter", "Point to Point Movement", "Simulation"], "age": "16", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games"]}, "190463": {"poll": [], "name": "Goodnight Butcher", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3227066.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Perfect Square Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Management"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Perfect Square Studios"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3227066_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Goodnight Butcher is about running your butchery and running for your life.<br/><br/>"}}
