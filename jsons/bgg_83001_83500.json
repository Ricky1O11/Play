Rounds one and two were 10-question trivia rounds, each of which started with a toss-up challenge. Round three  the obstacle course featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds.<br/><br/>Toss-up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up, each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target. Physical challenges were played the same way.<br/><br/>All questions were multiple choice, and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare, double dare, or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value.<br/><br/>The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle, the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller's D-pad. In order to grab the flag, the player had to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES' standard controller.<br/><br/>&quot;Prizes&quot; for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best &quot;ending&quot; by completing the last obstacle.<br/><br/>The obstacle course's flag colour depended on which team was playing, if blue, the flags were blue, and if red, the flags were red.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Double Dare (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "83007": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Disney's Tarzan Untamed", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"65709": "English/EU GameCube edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1324173.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2319": "Cartoon"}, "videogamefranchise": {"7663": "Disney's Tarzan"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "8", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4425": "GameCube"}, "videogamehonor": {"29704": "2001 D.I.C.E.

Buy for your friends, for your boss, for your grandparents so they'll remember the good old days. Family entertainment for ages 10 to adult.   BE AN IMMIGRANT FOR A DAY AND SEE WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THE AMERICAN DREAM YOUR OWN.<br/><br/>The game is presented in a way that is easy to understand and execute, meaning that by playing it you may only spend your time going through these situations whereas in real life you may lose your dignity.<br/><br/>The Illegal Game is a bilingual board game (English and Spanish for now) that allows you to experience what we have just discussed, that&rsquo;s right, as soon as you arrive at JFK you are thrown into a series of circumstances that are part of the daily lives of illegal aliens just as we described above, you&rsquo;ll understand what it feels to be cheated, scared, insecure, happy, struggle, etc., the game itself takes a couple of hours to play but will allow you to experience first hand, albeit on a small scale, what real people go through to survive in New York.  Play it to the end until you are able to retire and enjoy the American dream.<br/><br/>To start the game you need a minimum of two (2) players and a maximum of twelve (12), the more players in the game, the better the game runs, between seven and ten players would be ideal, although the game&rsquo;s dynamics allows other players to join in at any time, even after the game has already started, as long as they start up from the square marked as &lsquo;Start&rsquo;. Any of the players can also double up as a the Bank and all players get a &lsquo;Profession&rsquo; card and 5.000 (five thousand) game dollars to start.<br/><br/>Put the two sets of cards on their appropriate location on the board, that is, the cards that say 'Professions' on the space marked 'Professions' and the 'Main Board' cards on the spot next to them, you pick up a &lsquo;Main Board&rsquo; card every time the board instructs you to pick up a card and follow its instructions.<br/><br/>The game is uni-directional.   Use one die, this will tell you the number of squares that you have to move your token.  Follow the instructions of the square where you land. If you have to go back any space(s) then follow the instructions for that square also.  Except for the Professions cards, all other cards go back to the bottom of the pile.  If you get deported you must start again from the beginning (JFK).   Lose a day is the same as miss a turn.   You can be married in your country and still get married in this game. (This is just a game)<br/><br/>Profession:   The Professions card, stays with you while you are playing, since it indicates the salary your are to collect every week.    If you get another profession card,  you can keep it if you wish hold two or three jobs at the same time. You can hold up to three jobs.<br/><br/>Money:   Follow the instructions on the game board only when you land on them, not as you pass. (Except when it comes to 'Pay day', every time you pass Pay Day you get pay, even if you don't land exactly on it).  That is collect your salary as you pass.  This is the only exception, you are entitle to your salary as you pass, you don't need to have an exact landing, but if you land right on the Pay day square, collect twice your salary.  All bills have the value of an imaginary game dollar, whether Euro, Liras, Sucres, Pesos, Franks, etc., so 1000 liras is the same as 1000 dollars or 1000 Pesos, for the purposes of the game.<br/><br/>End of game: All players that retire win.   To retire, only a perfect landing on the final square is allowed.   At the end of the game, if you have 6 or less spaces to go, you need that exact number to come out on the die in order to beat the game, if you get more on the die than what you need,  wait for your next turn before trying again.   Your game ends on the square that reads: Retire happy, where the retired players can walk into the Sunshine scenery area, to wait for the rest of the players (Imagine that!)

It was first published in Japan by Towa Chiki in 1990 and in North America by SOFEL in 1992.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The player takes control of a magical human fighter who has the ability to transform himself into a flying dragon.  As the fighter, the player can run, crouch, jump, and attack with his sword as he would in most side-scrolling action games. Underneath his life gauge is a &quot;metamorphosis gauge&quot; that will gradually be filled as the player destroys his enemies.  When the metamorphosis gauge begins to flash, the player can transform into the dragon by pressing up and A button after jumping. As a dragon, the player will hover in the air while the screen scrolls automatically to the right, similarly to a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up game. The dragon's main attack is his fire breath. While the player can fly in any of the eight directions, they cannot turn around and the dragon will only face and attack to the right. While in dragon, the player's metamorphosis gauge will gradually be drained out. The player will transform back to a fighter if the metamorphosis gauge empties out completely or when the player rapidly taps the A button again.<br/><br/>As the fighter, the player can also shoot a projectile attack by holding the B button until the character begins to flash. The types of projectile fired by the player depends on the color of the player's outfit, which can be changed by picking up certain power-up items labeled with the letters G (green, the player's default color), B (blue), and R (red). Changing the color of the player's outfit will also change the pattern of the dragon's fire breath attack. Other power-ups includes energy restoring potions, a flower that helps fill the metamorphosis gauge faster, and a ring that destroys all on-screen enemies. At the end of each stage, the player will receive a staff that will increase their maximum health.<br/><br/>There are six stages in all, each with their own guardian awaiting to challenge the warrior at the end. The game will end if the player loses all of their life power and only three chances are provided to continue at the stage where they died before the player is forced to start all over.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dragon Fighter (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "83059": {"videogame": {"77268": "Midway Arcade Treasures"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Vindicators", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"219173": "North American Arcade edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic992238.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "videogamegenre": {"2352": "Run-and-gun"}, "average": "5", "videogamefranchise": {"27676": "Better Description Needed"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "usersrated": "1", "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"167735": "Midway Arcade Origins"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic992238_t.jpg", "description": "A science fiction birds-eye-view space/tank battle game; The arcade version requiring rudder control use by the players. Can be played either single or two player cooperative mode.<br/><br/>The original release of this for the NES was part of the controversial tengen cartridge suit between Tengen &amp; Nintendo due to their own cartridge design lacking Nintendo seal of approval.<br/><br/>(Text below this copied from Wikipedia, 14sep10)<br/>Vindicators is a one or two player video game released in the United States for multiple home console platforms by Tengen and for arcade by Atari Games in 1988. As with most Tengen NES games, Vindicators was unlicensed by Nintendo and used an alternate chip to defeat the 10NES lockout system. A version of the game was planned for the Atari Lynx and Apple IIGS, with the latter even completed, but both were canceled.<br/>..<br/>The game begins by asking the player(s) to choose a difficulty level, not only making the enemies more difficult and the players weaker, but higher difficulties start the players in a later set of levels (called &quot;galaxies&quot;) and with some powerups. The easiest difficulty level starts the player(s) in the first level with no bonuses. The player controls a tank  with constantly draining fuel, and must navigate through multiple levels (14 stations in the arcade version) from bottom to top, encountering obstacles and enemies. Along the way, a player may find powerups including tank fuel, stars (currency), shields, and two types of sub-weapons: smart shots (homing missiles) and bombs (powerful rockets). Each level has a key  that will open a door at the top of the level, which will either take the player to the next level or to a special hub with multiple powerups that must be escaped in 10 seconds or less. (15 for the NES version, though the timer stays stuck at 10 for five seconds before counting) If the player is unable to escape, the tank will lose half its fuel. After escaping the hub, the player(s) then proceeds to the next station.<br/><br/>Occasionally, the player(s) will face a boss that must be defeated to advance. Normal shots are ineffective however, and the player must decide/guess the appropriate time to buy sub-weapons to greatly raise the chance of victory. After destroying a boss, the player(s) can continue to the end of the level.<br/><br/>Between levels, the player is taken to a shop where items and upgrades to tank speed, power, etc. may be purchased with stars. Any damage caused to the player's tank will decrease the shield level. Purchasing a shield drastically reduces damage down to a mere pixel worth of the fuel gauge per hit. When the fuel depletes, the speed of the tank is reduced to a crawl and a countdown begins from 10.

Only your skill shall determine victory or defeat!<br/><br/>Taken from Wikipedia, 14sep10<br/>Shingen the Ruler (\u6b66\u7530\u4fe1\u7384\uff12) is a turn-based strategy game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), produced by HOT\u30fbB in 1989, and released in North America in 1990. The original Takeda Shingen video game was never released in North America. This game was called Takeda Shingen 2 in Japan.<br/>..<br/><br/>The game is set during the Sengoku period of Japan. The player is Takeda Shingen, who is based in the holding of Kai and Shinano. The goal of the game is to conquer central Japan, roughly spanning from Kyoto to Kamakura. With the exception of &quot;General Li&quot; and &quot;General Su&quot; in the holding of Noto, the remaining warlords depicted in the game are actual historical figures, including Oda Nobunaga and Uesugi Kenshin. Play starts in January 1545, and the player may make one action per province (up to four) per month.<br/><br/>The player must build and train an army, cultivate provinces, make (and break) alliances with neighboring daimyo. The game featured both random disasters (such as floods) and predefined events (such as the death of Shingen's father). One could also train Shingen's heir, Takeda Katsuyori.<br/><br/>Combat consists of a field skirmish, followed by a battle at the castle itself. Each holding's field and castle varies in layout. An automatic battle system is also provided, which calculates damage done by each army.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Shingen the Ruler,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "83061": {"videogame": {"83170": "Falcon Gold"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Falcon 3.0 Operation: Fighting Tiger", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"65832": "DOS"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic964106.jpg", "videogameseries": {"6839": "Falcon"}, "videogametheme": {"2514": "Flight"}, "usersrated": "2", "videogamecharacter": {"11492": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}, "videogameexpansion": {"81718": "Falcon 3.0"}, "average": "6.75", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4714": "DOS"}, "vgcharacterversion": {"148865": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"83170": "Falcon Gold"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic964106_t.jpg", "description": "From the box back:<br/><br/>YOU'VE MASTERED THE DESERT SKIES.

One player takes control of the Hacker, entering the area through the use of hidden Jack Points while the other player sets up the defensive protocols of his company's data fortress. The Hacker initializes and maneuvers his programs through cyberspace attempting to crash the defensive programs on his way to destroying all protection the Central unit has over its data. Meanwhile, the Admin brings his own programs to the fray as he holds off the Hacker until the rest of the Sys-Admins can log into the network. A truly skilled Admin can even trace the Hacker back to his actual Jack Point and crash the connection.<br/><br/>The game uses 54 tiles that represent programs, computer network and Jack Points. During a player's turn, he will be able to move a tile and play a tile in either order.

Great Fairy Wars ~ Eastern Three Fairies) is a shoot 'em up game, and is the 12.8th official game in the Touhou Project by the d\u014djin circle Team Shanghai Alice. The game was released on August 14, 2010 at Comiket 78. The game is the sequel to the Touhou Sangessei manga series as the illustrations were done by Makoto Hirasaka, the manga artist of the series itself instead of ZUN.<br/><br/>The game is sometimes called FW for short.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The game plays somewhat like a fusion of the Shoot the Bullet series, and the Phantasmagoria series, combined with &quot;standard&quot; Touhou gameplay. Cirno is able to shoot regularly, but also possesses a new &quot;freezing&quot; technique that adds a new twist to the game. Similar to Aya's camera, Cirno has an counter that fills up during gameplay, which determines the strength of her freeze attack, which is triggered by holding and then releasing the shot button not unlike the charged shots in the phantasmagoria games. When activated, Cirno's freeze attack will attack the immediate area directly in front of her, and freeze any bullets it comes in contact with for a duration proportionate to the level of charge % before vanishing afterward. When other bullets come into contact with frozen bullets, they too will freeze, allowing for large chains to be frozen in this way. Points and bombs are awarded for freezing large numbers of bullets.<br/><br/>Like the main-series games, Fairy Wars contains full stages each home to their own specific midboss and boss. However, Cirno is the only playable character, and there are only three stages during a playthrough instead of six. On the other hand, though, there are four different &quot;paths&quot; the player may choose to take, which influence the stages they play. Three of the paths are playable upon starting, while the 4th path is unlockable. The three paths that are playable from the beginning also offers two different routes in which the story will progress (exactly like in Imperishable Night after beating Reisen).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Fairy Wars&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "83103": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Saboteur", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"221559": "European Amstrad CPC Cassette edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1084098.png", "videogameseries": {"23636": "Saboteur"}, "videogametheme": {"2493": "Martial Arts"}, "usersrated": "11", "average": "7.13636", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"5203": "Amstrad CPC"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"216273": "Top 10 Collection"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1084098_t.png", "description": "Saboteur! is an action game published in 1985 for several 8-bit home computer formats by Durell Software.

Over the course of the first half of the game, the Hero will gain the people of Albion's support, overthrow Logan and become ruler of Albion him/herself. During the second half of the game, the player will have to choose whether or not to follow up on promises made to the public, at the risk of losing Albion's approval. While dealing with this, the player will also be faced with the possibility of war when &quot;Aurora&quot;, a neighboring country, begins to threaten Albion.<br/><br/>As in the first two installments, one of the main thematic devices will be how a player's choices affect their character and the world of Albion. The player's style of combat will also impact the gameplay: melee and ranged weapons will change with use, as well as the player's magic-casting gauntlets. For example, if a player slaughters innocents and civilians the weapon will darken and drip blood, but will glow if used against evil. The blade will also lengthen and widen if the player uses advanced attacks and defensive blocks.

Though generic, Bloodworks is designed to be flavorful and to provide a character a constant threat--his own &quot;dark side.&quot;<br/><br/>Vitally, there are two parts to each character: his Face and his Bane. A character's Face is what is usually seen in the game; it's every part of the character that he has worked on or picked up, his skills, occupation, and niche. A character's Bane is the part of him that tries to hold him back.<br/><br/>Each character occupies a distinct niche in the game, his/her Title. A Title implies something about the character; it should explain some of what he can do and his background. A good Title would be The Runaway Girl. The Title tells us what we need to know--the biggest factor in her background and perhaps some of her skills. It's slightly binding, but not too much. A poor Title would be The Fighter. &quot;Fighter&quot; is too general to be effective; a better Title would be The Barroom Brawler, The Jaded Gunman, or The Alleyway Knifer.<br/><br/>"}, "83124": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Anytime Pool", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"65970": "iPhone Editon"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic865939.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2362": "Sports - Cue Sports"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4443": "iPhone"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic865939_t.jpg", "description": "Play Anytime Pool iPhone/iPod touch game for the most realistic pool experience you can have on a handheld!

Players are be able to purchase these using &quot;Requisition Points&quot; which are awarded to the player for various feats they perform through play.<br/><br/>Players are able to choose their primary and secondary weapons, such as assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, and sniper rifles, as well as grenades, explosives, knives, mortar launchers and healing units. The player is also able to create their own player class through various stackable modules that determine the player's speed, stealth, or the regeneration of the limited-use jetpack. Excessive damage endured by the player to certain parts of their body, such as their legs, arms, head, or chest, may disable or hinder the use of these enhancements.<br/><br/>Dynamic Combat Missions (DCMs), a type of mini-game, can be activated mid-combat by the player, and can reward the player with Requisition Points when completed successfully.

It was released in 1985 for Macintosh  the first in the MacVenture series  and later ported  to several other systems.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The game takes place in Chicago during December 1941, shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The game character is Theodore &quot;Ace&quot; Harding, a retired boxer working as a private eye.<br/><br/>The player awakes one morning in a bathroom stall, unable to remember who he is. The bathroom stall turns out to be in Joe's Bar. A dead man is found in an upstairs office, and Ace is about to be framed for the murder. There are some clues as to the identity of the murdered man and to the player himself. A strap-down chair, mysterious vials, and a syringe are found, suggesting (together with a needle mark on the player's arm) that some kind of elaborate torture has taken place.<br/><br/>The streets of early 1940s Chicago are an unsafe place for a man with no memory. There are muggers, an old acquaintance with a grudge, not to mention the police. Here, the player's history as a boxer is a much more valuable asset than the smoking gun picked up in the game's beginning. Using addresses found around Joe's bar, Ace is able to make taxi rides to a few locations, including his office. A story unravels of a kidnapping in which Ace has played some part, but his memory lacks important details.<br/><br/>Ace's memory and mental condition get progressively worse, but eventually he is able to obtain an antidote to the drug that caused the memory loss. His recurring flashbacks now become filled with information.

You can play the game in a variety of ways and complete many activities including buying, trading, negotiating, bribing, spying, racing, escorting, transporting, mining, exploring, cleaning equipment, clearing paths through asteroid fields, recruiting, protecting, hiring crew members, fuel harvesting, and designing your ship. Evochron Legends is a technical simulation, not a character based simulator, so you are not limited by pre-selected character roles, skills, or attributes. Your decisions and actions define your role in the game and establish your reputations, wealth, progress, and ranking. The emphasis is on real-time tactical gameplay strategy for both combat and non-combat objectives. You are in control of your ship virtually all of the time in open space, including player controlled combat and planetary descents. Your ability to successfully pilot around or through dangerous objects in space, develop trade strategies, evade detection, harvest resources, efficiently explore for hidden benefits, and transport people and items can be just as important as your skill in combat. The game also rewards players who devise their own gameplay strategies and 'think outside the box'. With diverse optional objectives and many paths to choose from, Evochron Legends offers an amazing level of freeform gameplay.<br/><br/>Evochron Legends features unified gameplay profiles for both single player and multiplayer. The upgrades, ships, equipment, money, and commodities you earn in the game can be used in both the single player and multiplayer modes. You don't have to give up your progress in these areas when switching between single player and multiplayer, nor do you have to give up what you earn when you join different multiplayer sessions.<br/><br/>Everything you do in the game takes place in a seamless universe without system 'walls' or 'rooms' that require a jumpgate 'door' to access. There are no required warp gates or trade lanes to restrict your travel and hold you back. You can travel anywhere you want, with or without jump drives and gates, as long as you have the fuel and time to get there. You can descend into planet atmospheres (without loading screens or sudden environment flipping) to land at city trade stations, mine valuable materials, or explore for hidden items. You can escape to nebula clouds for sensor cover or hide in a massive asteroid cave for protection.<br/><br/>Design your ship for the role you want to play and customize the appearance by adjusting the position/scaling of the various parts of your ship. Whether it's combat, exploration, mining, trading, racing, or a variety of other activities, you'll find many ways to play and advance in the game.

SURVIVOR. PREY.<br/><br/>Three breeds of warrior.<br/>Three brutal campaigns.<br/>One relentless multi-player battleground.<br/><br/>Predator.<br/>Alien.<br/>Marine.<br/>Survive the horror with three playable species.<br/><br/>From Wikipedia:<br/><br/>Aliens vs. Predator is a science fiction first-person shooter video game, developed by Rebellion Developments, the team behind the 1999 original PC game, and published by Sega for Microsoft Windows, the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. The game is based on the Alien vs. Predator franchise, a combination of the characters and creatures of the Alien franchise and the Predator franchise. It was released February 16, 2010 in the US, February 19 in Europe and February 18 in Australia.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>There are three campaigns in the game, one for each race/faction (the Predators, the Aliens and the Colonial Marines), that, while separate in terms of individual plot and gameplay, form one overarching storyline.<br/><br/>Following the storyline of the campaign modes comes the multiplayer aspect of the game. In this Multiplayer section of the game, players face off in various different gametypes in various different ways.<br/><br/>Predators<br/><br/>As in the films, the Predator prefers to stalk its prey from the safety of treetops and the gameplay reflects this, the player leaping from branch to branch automatically with the help of a &quot;focus jumping&quot; game mechanic. The Predator has different vision modes, the most recognizable from the films being a thermal imaging scanner, but the player also has different vision modes for spotting Aliens (only accessible from a special mask the player picks up in-game) and viewing the world normally. For example, the Heat Vision mode allows the player to see marines, even at a distance, crystal clearly, while it renders Aliens nearly invisible, the Alien vision working in reverse, and regular vision seeing the environment and other predators better than the other two, making battles between two or all three species a tactical juggle to prioritize enemies based on their threat to the player.<br/><br/>Aliens<br/><br/>Aliens fight in close-quarters with their claws and tails, getting as close as possible to their prey as quickly as possible. Aliens have the ability to climb walls and jump from distances without effort, and can blend in with shadows, using darkness to their advantage. Within limited ranges, aliens can seek out prey through walls. These senses also allow Aliens to clearly observe cloaked Predators. In the single player campaign, players will have the opportunity to harvest 'hosts'. By pinning the host, nearby facehuggers are able to locate and latch on to them, thereby propagating the Hive. Throughout the game, the player also has the opportunity to perform 'Stealth Kills'.<br/><br/>Colonial Marines<br/><br/>The Colonial Marine campaign is far closer to that of a standard first-person shooter. Marines carry a wide arsenal including pulse rifles, flamethrowers, and auto-tracking Smartguns. To help navigate the surroundings, marines are equipped with shoulder-mounted lamps, surveying flares to briefly illuminate darkened areas, and motion trackers, capable of providing info on hostile positioning as they move.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Aliens vs. Predator (video game)&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "83278": {"boardgamedesigner": {"1077": {"name": "Zolt\u00e1n Acz\u00e9l"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Captain Cool", "playingtime": "45", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2080": "Area Control / Area Influence"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "97", "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic814728_t.jpg", "average": "5.79567", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8820": {"name": "G\u00e9m Klub Kft."}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic814728.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"68141": "Heidelberger / G\u00e9m Klub International edition"}, "maxplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1023": {"name": "Bluffing"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "45", "description": "The game of bluffing and strategy in the criminal circles!<br/><br/>The pubs of the harbor district are bustling with activity.

The game takes place in twelve medieval castles owned by the eponymous Dr. Creep, and the player's task is to escape from each castle. One or two-player game is possible, allowing collaborative gaming for solving the puzzles.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>When the game starts, the player can select from any of the twelve castles, which have horror-movie-style names such as Sylvania, Carpathia, Callanwolde, or Lovecraft, or a tutorial castle. The player then starts from a specific room inside the castle, and must use his wits and skill to traverse through a vast network of interconnected rooms to find the exit.<br/><br/>The rooms consist of platforms on various levels, connected by ladders and sliding poles. Doors lead from one room to another. Some doors are locked, and the player must find a key to be able to go through them. Most doors are not locked but may be opened by a doorbell. However, in some cases, the doorbell is only on one &quot;side&quot; of the door (i.e. in one connecting room but not the other), and sometimes the doorbell is difficult to reach.<br/><br/>A central aspect of the game is the imaginative use of various contraptions and devices in the rooms. Conveyor belts, force fields, and laser guns hinder the player's progress. In some places he must avoid, trap, or kill mummies and Frankenstein monsters. Teleport devices are often required to navigate through a room.<br/><br/>The player in The Castles of Dr. Creep has an unlimited amount of lives.

It was released for the Apple II and Commodore 64. The original, Apple II-series version was by David Schroeder, who also developed the concept for the game. The game was ported to the Commodore 64 by Leonard Bertoni.(1)<br/><br/>User Summary - Gameplay<br/><br/>In Dino eggs the player is a time traveller, who has to gather dino eggs and hatchlings in the Mesozoic era. The game cosists of 9 different levels. A level cosists of 4 floor, connected by ladders and holes. Each level is a wrap-around, so when the player leaves on the right side of the screen, he immediately appears on the left side. There's no scrolling: the game screen shows the entire level.<br/><br/>The player is warped in the level in a forcefield, which stays on-screen. The forcefield is impenetrable for the smaller dangers, but dino mom can still squash the player seeking safety there.<br/><br/>Upon starting, the first thing a player must do is start a fire, by bringing two pieces of wood together. As long as there isn't a fire burning, 'dino mom' might detct the thief and a big dino leg appears at the top of the screen and stomps down, trying to flatten the unfortunate player under it. As soon as a fire burns, 'mom' will stay away. A fire burns with a small number above it (1-9) indicating it's lifetime. As soon as it's 1, a player can add wood to it by entering the fire with a piece (normal 2-8 fires are lethal).<br/><br/>After starting the fire, the player starts looking for and gathering eggs. eggs must be returned to the force field. Some eggs hatch, and the hatchling can be caught by jumping over it (creating a containing field). Contact with a hatchling will kill the hatchling ('contamination') - not the player.<br/><br/>Levels are increasingly difficult. The player encounters spiders, snakes and centipedes. Contact with them doesn't kill immediately, but after a short time the player 'devolves' into a spider (frightening sight, even with those graphics), a life is lost and a fresh time traveller appears.<br/><br/>Advancing to the next level can obviously be done by collecting enough egg and catching enough hatchlings. Afther the 9th level is done, the game keeps looping to the 9th level, so scorewise, the game is unlimited.<br/><br/>(1) Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dino Eggs&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "83315": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Reach for the Stars", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"66388": "US Windows Matrix re-release"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815199.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "usersrated": "8", "average": "5.625", "videogamegenre": {"2391": "4x Strategy"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic815199_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box<br/><br/>Mankind reached for the stars - and found that the galaxy is NOT a friendly neighborhood.<br/><br/>A strategy game of epic exploration and cataclysmic combat.

The game covers battles and campaigns in the Mediterranean and Near East from the Persian defeat at Marathon in 490 BC to Caesar's victory at Pharsalus in 48 BC.  It has been exhaustively tested and refined over the past several years, and is based on Professor Philip Sabin's decades of research and simulation design on ancient warfare; and it includes an updated copy of his book, with extensive historical and design notes on every scenario.<br/><br/>The game can be fought on three levels - the grand tactical, the grand strategic, or a combination of the two.  At the grand tactical level, 1 or 2 players may refight any of 35 different land battles such as Leuctra, Gaugamela, Raphia, Cannae, Cynoscephalae or the Sambre - far more than in any other single boxed game.  At the grand strategic level, 1 to 4 players may refight the epic duels of the two centuries from 350 to 150 BC, starting with the eclipse of Achaemenid Persia by Alexander of Macedon, and ending with Hannibal's campaigns and the conquest of Carthage and the Hellenistic states by the resurgent Roman republic.  The most ambitious games combine these two levels, and see 1 to 4 players using tactical battles to resolve strategic campaigns across part or all of this two century period, or else refighting a series of historical battles to decide conflicts such as the three-cornered contest for dominance between Athens, Sparta and Thebes from the start of the Peloponnesian War to the death of Epaminondas.<br/><br/>The accent throughout is on combining historical accuracy with speed and accessibility.  The free-standing strategic game may be completed in just 30 minutes, while individual land battles may be re-fought in two hours or less.  There is constant player interaction, and a series of tortuous dilemmas - how should the scarce command points be allocated across the battlefront, which troop types should be put in the lead against particular opponents, should units attack all-out at the cost of becoming exhausted themselves, and should generals join the fighting to rally their disheartened men at the risk of being killed and so making things far worse?  The game includes all the many troop types from hoplites, legionaries, phalangites and archers to cataphracts, scythed chariots and war elephants, and it includes simple rules to reflect the huge differences in generalship and troop quality and to allow outclassed armies to win a handicapped 'game victory' even if they are defeated on the field, as long as they do better than they did historically.  All aspects of the game are avowedly solitaire-friendly, and can be run by a single player swapping sides just as easily as by one or more players per side.<br/><br/>Tactical battles are fought on a 5 x 4 grid of full-colour 5 inch square hard mounted terrain tiles, which dovetail to form any desired battlefield.  The individually die-cut counters have rounded corners and are also in full-colour; they depict the various different troop types. The strategic game is fought on a hard mounted map showing the area from Spain to India.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": {"66401": "First Edition"}, "average": "7.9524", "name": "Lost Battles", "playingtime": "140", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "12", "usersrated": "167", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4664": "Wargames"}, "boardgamefamily": {"5606": "Ancient Rome"}}, "83326": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Hippo Blast", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"66402": "iPhone Version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic864444.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2471": "Animals"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4443": "iPhone"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic864444_t.jpg", "description": "From the game's website:<br/><br/>Compete against the world!

It is the first Madden game for the PlayStation Portable and Xbox 360.<br/><br/>One of the touted additions to the 2006 version of Madden is Superstar mode, which allows the player to create and take control of an NFL player from his rookie year all the way to retirement. An athlete can be created by evaluating pairs of parents &mdash; judging, based on their IQs, occupations, and hobbies, whether their child would excel in the NFL &mdash; or by importing a player from NCAA Football 06 or NFL Street 2. This player is 21 years old at the start of his career. Superstar mode is essentially Madden's Franchise mode seen through the eyes of this athlete. Rather than manage the team's front office, the player manages the career of his athlete: selecting movie roles, accepting product endorsement, etc. The player can access different areas of the city the Superstar is playing in such as the barber shop, to get a haircut or the performance institute to raise attributes if the player's agent has a key. As the player gains in popularity and prestige the superstar's home will transform from an apartment to a luxurious mansion. The player will receive calls from former NFL running back Terrell Davis, who is the player's mentor and guide. This addition has met with mixed reviews from video game reviewers. Although the idea is considered great in concept, many found the actual execution of the mode to be lackluster.<br/><br/>Madden NFL 06 also features the new QB Vision Control. A cone, appearing as a spotlight emitting from the quarterback, simulates his field of vision. To make an accurate pass, the quarterback must have his intended receiver in his field of vision. Passing to a receiver not in the cone reduces pass accuracy significantly. The size of the quarterback's vision cone is directly correlated to his Awareness rating; Quarterbacks such as Peyton Manning, Brett Favre and Tom Brady see nearly the entire field at once, whereas a mediocre quarterback such as David Carr, Aaron Brooks or Kyle Boller will see only a sliver of the field, however this has been very criticized by many fans because it may resemble some bias that EA Sports and the Madden series itself is, frequently accused of (for example many players say that Ben Roethlisberger's stats were, to some extent, deflated). A player can shift the vision cone with the right analog stick, or focus the cone on a specific receiver by holding a shoulder button and pressing the button assigned to that receiver. (On the highest difficulty level, once a receiver completes his route, his button label disappears; to make it reappear the quarterback must look in his direction.) This change also met with lukewarm reception. Although the passing system adds a whole new level of realism, it also makes the game significantly more difficult for players playing teams with less-aware quarterbacks. These players will be forced to improve their reflexes in order to be competitive, as throwing outside the QB vision cone results in a very weak and inaccurate pass.<br/><br/>Accompanying QB Vision is Precision Passing. Pressing the directional button or left analog stick in a certain direction as you pass the ball will make the throw over the receiver's head (Up), behind him (Left), in front of him (Right), or at his knees (Down).<br/><br/>Perhaps the most critically acclaimed new feature is the truck stick, which functions like an offensive version of the hit stick from the previous year. When running the football, a player can push forward the right analog stick to run over the defender, at the cost of risking a potential fumble. Several features from previous titles return such as hot routes, playmaker features, and franchise features.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Madden 06&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "83336": {"statistics": {}, "name": "NCAA Football 06", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"66414": "NA PS2 edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic809531.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4897": "NCAA Football"}, "videogametheme": {"2365": "Sports - American Football"}, "videogamegenre": {"2157": "Sports"}, "average": "7", "videogamefranchise": {"4894": "EA Sports"}, "videogameplatform": {"4434": "PlayStation 2"}, "usersrated": "3", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic809531_t.jpg", "description": "NCAA Football '06, known colloquially as College Football 2006 is a collegiate American football video game which was released on July 11, 2005.

The player must deal with a minor outbreak in the town of Still Creek, and move on before the military arrives and kills any infected (including non-zombies like Katey). The player can reach up to level five in Case Zero, with the level and any combo cards earned able to be transferred into the main game.<br/><br/>Case Zero was released on August 31, 2010 in North America and Europe, then in Japan at a later date because the Computer Entertainment Rating Organization was concerned about the content and the download's rating. The game is region-locked to these specific areas, and cannot be downloaded outside these regions. In the game's first week of release, 300,000 downloads were made: the fastest selling game on Xbox Live Arcade. On September 15, Capcom announced that Case Zero had received more than 500,000 downloads.<br/><br/>Reception for Case Zero has been generally favorable, receiving an average score of 79 on Metacritic. IGN gave the title a 6.5 out of 10 rating, criticizing the load times and the lack of things to do. GameSpot gave the title an 8 out of 10 rating, praising the fun zombie killing, in-depth weapon creation, and multiple endings that require several playthroughs. Joystiq gave the title a 4 out of 5 star rating, and recommending the game to anyone because of both the content and the price.

Knights become Forest oxen, with great horns that can kill in a neighboring square. Pawns become minor pieces, giving up their promotion ability to do so.

Certain gadgets designed to frighten enemies during combat are provided, such as smoke grenades, flash bang grenades, and an 'HF Transponder', which summons bats to gather around and incapacitate enemies with fear. On top of this is traditional stealth gameplay reminiscent of the Splinter Cell series (this probably due to the fact that the game was written by Splinter Cell  creator JT Petty), such as sneaking and taking out enemies from behind.

Gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, and makes use of the same 2 joystick, 3 pedal, 40 button controller.<br/><br/>Gameplay is entirely online and consists of various game types (such as deathmatch, capture the flag, and others). Up to 10 players (five against five) can supposedly participate, and each player must have an Xbox, Xbox Live, and the special controller to play the game. However, at this time everywhere except Japan, most matches are limited to 3 vs. 3 with the some 4 vs. 4 and rare 5 vs. 5 combat. Players connecting with less than 100 kB/s up and 300 kB/s down are usually limited to 4 on 4 or 3 on 3 combat. There are a total of 10 new VT's introduced in this game, for a total of 31 different models, but it is worth mention that there is no single player mode available. After having their VT destroyed during an online match, the player must go through the entire start-up process again before re-spawning onto the battlefield.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Steel Battalion: Line of Contact&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "83452": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Asphalt 4: Elite Racing", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"66750": "DSiWare Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic865940.jpg", "videogameseries": {"7730": "Asphalt"}, "videogametheme": {"2456": "Driving"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2154": "Racing"}, "videogameplatform": {"4443": "iPhone"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic865940_t.jpg", "description": "Face the world&rsquo;s richest drivers in high-speed races through traffic or take on your friends in the exclusive multiplayer mode!

Each team selects a playing piece and places it on the Start Space on the board.<br/><br/>Split the players into two teams. The oldest player in each team will become the first Question Master for their team. The team containing the youngest player will start.<br/><br/>THE QUESTIONS<br/>There are four questions on the back of each card. The first question is beside the Red Square followed by the White, Blue and Green.<br/><br/>There are three kinds of question cards:<br/><br/>Picture cards - on which there is a picture that the questions relate to.<br/><br/>Common Theme Cards - on which all the answers have a common theme.<br/><br/>Pot Luck Cards - on which there are random Best of British questions.<br/><br/>THE BOARD<br/>The board is a path from the outer Start space into the Winning Zone in the centre of the board. The spaces on the board are made up of the four different colours that match those on the Question Cards. The first four spaces on the board match the order of those on the cards.<br/><br/>After the first four spaces the colour order becomes random so just answering one question correctly can sometimes mean a big leap forward.<br/><br/>PLAY<br/>The Question Master for the team containing the youngest player picks up the first Question Card from the box making sure the answers are concealed from all the players on both teams.<br/><br/>If it is a Picture Card, the picture is shown to all the players on both teams. If it is a Themed Card, the theme is read out to all the players on both teams.<br/><br/>The Question Master reads out the Red Question to the opposing team. If that team answers correctly they move their piece onto the first Red Space on the board. The same team is then given the White Question, moving their piece onto the White Space if they answer correctly and so on down the card.<br/><br/>If at anytime a question is answered incorrectly then the Question Master can put the same question to the members of their own team for a bonus move. If they answer correctly they move their own piece onto the next space on the board that matches the colour of the question. The original team is always given the first chance to answer each question. After the Green Question has been played the card is placed to the back of the card box.<br/><br/>The Question Master for the other team now takes out the next card from the box and plays the card to their opponents in the same way.<br/><br/>The two teams take alternate turns at being the Question Master and also alternate the roll of Question Master within their team.<br/><br/>When any team answers a question correctly and there are no spaces left matching that colour left on the path, they move their piece directly into the Winning Zone.<br/><br/>WINNING ZONE<br/>Once inside the Winning Zone a team no longer moves their piece after answering a question correctly. The first team to answer any bonus question correctly after having entered the Winning Zone wins.<br/><br/>INDIVIDUAL PLAY<br/>The oldest player becomes Question Master for the first game and asks the first card to the player on their left. The bonus opportunity for any incorrect answer passes firstly to the next player to the left and so on.

It was an era that saw cobblers become princes and emperors become exiles, an age of legendary diplomats and brilliant tacticians. Scope of the game covers all of Europe and North Africa from 1792 to 1820. Main map is divided into more than 200 provinces. There are eight national powers from which players may control, and more than 90 minor powers controlled by the computer. The national powers are France, Britain, Austria, Prussia, Russia, Turkey, Spain, and Sweden. Turns at the strategic level correspond to one month of game time; turns on the tactical level correspond to twenty minutes of game time. Players control military, diplomatic, economic, and social aspects of their nations. This includes such activities as drafting and ratifying treaties; offering and accepting trade routes; moving and assigning activities to diplomats; levying and supplying military units. Troops are controlled at the division level and can be arranged into corps and armies. A wide diversity of troop types is implemented, including: light and Jager infantry; cossacks and cossack cavalry; heavy and horse artillery; howitzers; guerilla infantry; Janissaries; merchant ships; diplomats; frigates and privateers. There are more than thirty types of units in all. Units have individual strength and quality (morale) ratings that are determined by the level of barracks and dockyard improvements in the province in which they were created.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher Website.<br/><br/>"}, "83472": {"rpgitemversion": {"66851": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Priest's Player Pack", "rpgproducer": {"19111": "Nancy J.

It is of the shogi branch of the chess family but does not involve drops. Set-up is on the back row identical to international chess <i>except</i> that king is placed on the center left column for either player so that kings are not facing each other. Pawn however occupy the third rather than the second row.<br/><br/>For simplicity, I'm using the international chess names of pieces rather than the traditional Japanese names. The king moves one space in any direction but castling does not exist. The queen moves one space in any direction except diagonally backwards. Bishops move either one space diagonally in any direction or one space forward. Knights move only forward in an otherwise normal knight's move so that the piece jumps to a space on either side of the space two rows ahead of its starting position. Rooks move only forward but otherwise like a standard rook. Pawns move only one space forward with no initial two-step move, and all pieces including pawns capture as they move.<br/><br/>The promotion zone is the last three rows on the board for either player. All pieces except the king and queen promote to the queen. Promotion is optional so long as a piece still has a legal move in its non-promoted state. The promotion happens at the end of the move and the move must either begin or end in the promotion zone.<br/><br/>The object is to check-mate the opponent's king. Both bared king and stalemate count as a win, but a bared king becomes a draw if the other player can bare one's king in the next move.<br/><br/>"}, "83478": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bagman", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"66863": "Arcade version"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1550953.png", "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "usersrated": "1", "average": "7", "videogamegenre": {"2314": "Arcade"}, "videogameplatform": {"4781": "Arcade"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1550953_t.png", "description": "Your character runs through mine shafts collecting money bags and carrying them to the top of the mine climbing a ladder, using an elevator, or jumping into or out of ore carts.<br/><br/>You must avoid guards, rolling ore carts, descending elevators, and elevator shafts.

Sho shogi has no drop mechanism. All pieces used in modern shogi are used in sho shogi and have the same movements and initial positions, but sho shogi also has one additional piece with respect to the modern game-- the drunken elephant which promotes to a crown prince and begins the game directly in front of the &quot;king&quot; (osho or gyokusho). The drunken elephant moves one space in any direction except directly backwards, and the crown prince moves exactly like a king because it <i>is</i> a second king. Namely both the crown prince and the king must be bared, checkmated and/or stalemated simultaneously to win.
