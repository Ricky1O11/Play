In no place is this felt more keenly than in the large, crowded cities where Imperial troops and agents frequently boast a major presence. There, corruption runs rampant and crimes often go unpunished. Still, even in these oppressive, urban environments, there are some who dedicate themselves to fighting back from the shadows. These Sentinels are the last bastions of hope in these desperate cities, and theirs is often a thankless vigil. Even as they try to redress unsolved crimes and loosen the Empire's stranglehold upon their worlds, they risk being reported by ordinary citizens who think they're doing the right thing.<br/><br/>A sourcebook for Star Wars: Force and Destiny, Endless Vigil empowers these Sentinels and their labors with new specializations, species, signature abilities, and gear. Additionally, Game Masters will find a wealth of material designed to enrich their urban encounters; new droid adversaries and information on podracing run alongside tips and charts to help you get the most of your urban encounters and investigative adventures.<br/><br/>"}, "212004": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Jean Millemann"], "poll": [], "name": "Sherlock Holmes D\u00e9tective Conseil: Oliver Stone", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play"], "yearpublished": "1990", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgamefamily": ["Characters: Sherlock Holmes", "Cities: London", "Country: England", "Mystery Novels", "Solitaire Games"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Role Mag'"], "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Expansion for Base-game", "Murder/Mystery"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "On a brisk Sunday morning at around 10am, as we wind our way around the grounds of the Tower of London, a boy, not more than ten years of age, hails Wiggins with a message:<br/><br/>My dear friends, Oliver Stone was found dead in his home.

En este cap&iacute;tulo podr&aacute;s conocer con detalle la historia de los hombres del norte en la pen&iacute;nsula Ib&eacute;rica, sus episodios m&aacute;s significativos y sus an&eacute;cdotas m&aacute;s sorprendentes, as&iacute; como la situaci&oacute;n exacta de los reinos peninsulares en torno al siglo X: gobierno, administraci&oacute;n, ej&eacute;rcito, sociedad y costumbres.<br/><br/>Con respecto a las tres aventuras presentes en Jakobsland, en principio independientes (aunque las dos primeras se podr&iacute;an enlazar con algunos ajustes), son:<br/><br/>Al-Urdum&acirc;niyyun (de Luis Felipe Garc&iacute;a, &quot;Tadevs&quot;). Enmarcada en el primer asedio vikingo que sufri&oacute; la ciudad de Sevilla, en 844, la aventura gira en torno a una sorprendente misi&oacute;n de infiltraci&oacute;n. Los hechos que relata son extraordinariamente fidedignos, fruto de la encomiable labor de investigaci&oacute;n del autor, si bien los huecos dejados por la historia han sido rellenados de ficci&oacute;n narrativa para el disfrute de jugadores y DJ. A pesar de contar con un inconfundible sabor andalus&iacute;, la historia respeta y mantiene la atm&oacute;sfera original de Walhalla y, adem&aacute;s, resulta terriblemente divertida.<br/>    El banquete del cuervo solitario (de Jorge Mir Bel y David Bueno Minguill&oacute;n, d&uacute;o creativo conocido como &quot;Jalfdaltonics&quot;). La aventura se sit&uacute;a en la primavera de 859, cuando, tras asolar el Mediterr&aacute;neo y pasar el invierno en la Camarga francesa, la expedici&oacute;n de Hastein Ragnarsson y Bj&ouml;rn &quot;J&auml;rnsida&quot; se encuentra remontando el r&iacute;o Ebro. Las tierras que atraviesan forman parte de las posesiones de los Banu Qasi, que han optado por guarnecerse en sus plazas fuertes. Esta poderosa familia parece hacer caso omiso del juramento del gran emir de C&oacute;rdoba, que ha puesto precio a la cabeza de los jefes vikingos. Las cosas pronto se complican, y mucho, para unos PJ que vivir&aacute;n una de las m&aacute;s formidables aventuras que nunca se han escrito para Walhalla, el juego de rol de la Plena Edad Media.<br/>    Ni por todo el oro de Galicia (de Justo Molina Ram&iacute;rez). La aventura tiene lugar en la Villa Sancti Iacobi, lo que hoy es Santiago de Compostela, y transcurre en el mes de marzo de 968. Los PJ forman parte de un contingente de hombres del norte al mando del caudillo Gudr&ouml;d (&quot;Gunderedo&quot; para los gallegos), el cual ha conseguido poner sitio a la famosa ciudad. Mientras el jefe vikingo negocia con los cristianos la cantidad de oro que le llevar&iacute;a a levantar el asedio y volver a echarse a la mar, los PJ tendr&aacute;n que rescatar a un joven vikingo llamado Uddi, el cual puede poner en peligro a todos sus &quot;hermanos&quot;. En resumen, una trama llena de emoci&oacute;n y de secuencias memorables, el final m&aacute;s digno para Jakobsland.<br/><br/>NOTA: Las tres aventuras rese&ntilde;adas fueron, junto con El tesoro de los gigantes de Jes&uacute;s Matheo Labeaga (ya publicada en PDF), las ganadores del concurso de prem&oacute;dulos de Walhalla que se organiz&oacute; en verano de 2014.<br/><br/>"}, "212162": {"poll": [], "name": "Soda Dungeon", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Android edition", "iOS edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3235664.png", "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Afro-Ninja Productions"], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone"], "average": "6", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Armor Games"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3235664_t.png", "description": "Publisher Website: Stock the tavern with rare sodas, entice adventurers to join your cause, and plunder a massive dungeon for loot in this turn-based dungeon crawler.

Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.<br/><br/>Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There will be several maps &mdash; Pictish Village, Underground temple, Tavern, Pirate ship, etc. &mdash; and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There will be a dozen playable scenarios in the base box.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Opponent gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.<br/><br/>During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.<br/><br/>The Opponent plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Opponent has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Opponent chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Opponent can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).<br/><br/>In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Opponent wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Opponent has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.<br/><br/>Components (according to the back of the box):<br/><br/>     33 spell cards (actually 41 in French, 41 in English)<br/>     33 equipment cards (actually 29, 5 blanks, and 5 labeled A through E ---two sets of 39, in English and French)<br/>     61 tiles (actually 90, see below)<br/>     39 tokens<br/>     17 Hero sheets<br/>     1 scenario booklet (1 in French, 1 in English; 4 scenarios)<br/>     1 map board<br/>     6 dice<br/>     1 dice bag<br/>     1 map of Conan's world (single-sided, English only)<br/>     115 miniatures (plastic)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The tiles need to be looked at more closely. 29 come in English-French pairs, 16 are unique (meant to be used in either language: the Event tile, the two Pirates, and 13 Heroes), and 8 are non-lingual pairs (e.g. Conan, Thaug, Constantius, Slasher, etc.). A single-language set thus consists of 29+16+8 = 53 tiles, the remaining 37 being set aside.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "maxplaytime": "120", "average": "8.25", "name": "Conan: Collectors Box", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "81", "boardgamefamily": ["Campaign Games", "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"]}, "212246": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "statistics": [], "name": "Mudhollow Inn", "rpgartist": ["Shafali Anand", "Brian Moseley"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpg": ["Generic / Universal"], "usersrated": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "rpgpublisher": ["Darkfuries Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"], "poll": [], "average": "0", "description": "From the Publisher's Website:<br/><br/>From the Film The Gamers: Dorkness Rising Set in the backdrop of a boggy swamp, the Mudhollow Inn is a highly detailed medieval pub  and hostel consisting of a ground and second story, cellar, and outer buildings.

Using ERA players can create their characters using a step by step wizard, then level them up and configure all details in stats, skills and special abilities, even overriding the automatic calculations. Afterwards, they can be added to a running campaign in the adventuring module. From there, the game master can control all aspects of the game: resolve maneuvers, resistances, resting, and of course, spell casting and combat.<br/><br/>With ERA you can create Rolemaster characters and then manage their adventures. Players can also monitor their characters from their mobile devices as the action progresses. But no adventure is complete without some gritty combat. Blows must be dealt, and damage resolved. In the free base ERA product you will find 2 sample weapons and 3 critical tables.<br/><br/>Rolemaster Companion I has a lot to offer. Get it and add to ERA: 8 professions, 22 races, 104 background option descriptions, 34 spell lists, 117 individual spells, 41 herbs and 34 creature templates!<br/><br/>    Heal and smite with the holy power of a paladin, sneak under the magical shadows of the nightblade, or smash everything with a mighty barbarian.<br/>    The new background options offer both skills at arms and skills at magic. A Master Tactician, or a Shapechanger, among others, are now possible.<br/>    The races in this package will allow variant elves, halflings, mannish tribes, and half-breeds from dwarves to trolls.<br/>    Give the herbalists in the party the reward they deserve: Tharm for their long journeys under the sun, and some Carneyar to be healed after a though combat.<br/>    Arcane magic is now at your disposal. And druidic magic. And assassination spells. And crafting-enhancement powers. And just in case, more than a hundred individual spells with complete descriptions, from a simple Mental Grasp to the devastating power of Hellfrost.<br/>    This package is not all about the heroes. All creatures in RMC Companion I are included, ready to be used as templates to drop as NPCs in your adventure. This means Carnivorous Flying Monkeys are an option. Also Black Unicorns. But it is easier just to call for a Black Reaver, and let it walk. Click, click.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "212305": {"rpgdesigner": ["Herb Barents", "Larry Ellena", "Bill Hall", "Jon M.

The first player or team to create two runs wins!<br/><br/>How to Play: A player begins his turn by rolling all five dice. The combination of the dice facing up is to be read like cards in a poker hand. Viable hands include full house, straight, five of a kind, four of a kind, three of a kind, two pairs and one pair.<br/><br/>A player may throw the dice once, twice or up to three times to roll the best possible combination. After their first roll, a player can roll again anything from one to five of the dice. On your second and third rolls you can again roll one to five of the dice, including re-rolling anything you had set aside in the first roll.  After the third roll place a poker chip of your team color on the board that corresponds to the poker hand combination of dice. Then the next player to the left rolls the five dice to start their turn.<br/><br/>If the squares of the board corresponding to the dice combination rolled is already covered by a chip, then that player's turn is over and they cannot play a chip on the game board. Note: there are usually two of each possible combination on the board.<br/><br/>When a player or team places five chips in a row on the board this constitutes a run. Chips in a run are protected during the remainder of the game. A player's run may share common chips with their other runs, however, a player cannot claim a new run by adding chips to the end of an established run. A new run must contain at least 4 chips not in common with the original run.<br/><br/>The first player or team to create two runs on the board wins.<br/><br/>Special Rules:<br/>The center square on the game board that can be used by all players as part of a run, but cannot be claimed by any one player.<br/><br/>Lucky 7: Anytime a player rolls a combination of the five dice so that the face value adds up to seven a player has the option to place a chip on either Luck 7 or whatever other combination appears on the dice (full house, three of a kind, etc).<br/><br/>Lucky 11: Anytime a player rolls a combination of the five dice so that the face value adds up to eleven a player has the option to place a chip on either Luck 11 or whatever other combination appears on the dice (full house, three of a kind, etc).<br/><br/>Five of a Kind: Anytime a player rolls a five of a kind that player may place their chip on ANY open square on the game board.  Wild!<br/><br/>Bouncer: After all the &quot;straight&quot; squares on the game board are filled, every time you roll another straight the results is a &quot;bouncer&quot;. A bouncer allows the player to remove any one opponents chip from game board except a chip that has been placed in an already  completed run.<br/><br/>After all the &quot;full house&quot; squares on the game board are filled, every time you roll another straight the results is a &quot;bouncer&quot;.

The basic game features a match between two teams drawn from a number of fantasy archetypes, playing a warped version of American Football.<br/><br/>The Blood Bowl boxed game contains two teams: Humans, an all-round team who are flexible enough to adapt to any style of play, or Orcs, who make up in brute force what they lack in finesse. The teams are represented by coloured plastic miniatures, and push-fit assembly is required before use. The game is expandable, and additional rules and teams will be made available through expansion sets and supplements.<br/><br/>Actions in the game are resolved through the use of dice. Regular six-sided dice are used to make tests in a number of cases, such as when a player attempts to pick up the ball, pass it, catch it or dodge past an enemy player. Custom dice are used when one player wishes to Block another, using graphics to represent each of the different (but all violent) potential outcomes.<br/><br/>The rules in this edition of Blood Bowl are almost identical to those found in the Competition Rules Pack, which was the culmination of several years of development of the Blood Bowl Living Rulebook. This has resulted in an incredibly well-honed game which sees regular competition play around the world. In fact each team takes turns moving, blocking and advancing the football down the field.

A game of conquest, which revolves around an important and defining historical period: the 1400.<br/><br/>But this century is so much more than just a bunch of years: it&rsquo;s one of the most magnificent periods in the history of Italy and the European culture. Because it&rsquo;s not a coincidence if the end of this century marks the beginning of the &ldquo;Modern Age&rdquo;.<br/>M400 comes from the idea to bring strategic board games to the next level; neither the name nor the historical references to the XV century are just a fortuity. The century that saw the fall of the last Eastern Roman Empire, the birth of the power of Spain and England, the ascent of the Russian Republics, and the achievements of the glorious Republic of Venice are the ideal background for the birth of this new way to have fun with history.<br/>M400 has a high level of playability with multiple players, and the cards allow an always different gameplay, helping the creation of new and different matches. Every time a player finds themselves in the late Medieval period of the game, they can rewrite important pages of history in new ways, through trades, battles, journeys and revolutions. The challenge and the strategy also allow to create with the opponents new dynamics of gameplay beyond the rules: deceptions, bluffs, silent and secret alliances. The almost total absence of chances and coincidences, linked to the dices, reduces the possibility of a player to win just by chance.<br/>M400 is a game which contains very different elements, elements that can mix, and give the player a unique and unpredictable kind of entertainment. This game is for everybody, and the choice of the Latin makes it reach a new level of universality, just like the one of the world of the XV century.<br/><br/>M400 is a card-driven Risk-like game. A player's turns consists of four phases: 1) draw cards, 2) trade cards with other players, 3) move army, 4) expand. Players use cards to resolve combats and score points by occupying a region (temporary points) and defeating opponents (permanent points).

You may only choose to carry one item, so every room will provide a new discovery and a decision.<br/><br/>Human Goal:<br/>Players are attempting to find all three items that their character requires. When one player finds all three items the game is over.  If all but one player has 2 items, the game is over as well. Each of the collected items has a point value and the points are totaled at the end of the game. You must be careful what items you choose to collect, if the items you collect are of too low a point value a player with fewer items may still win.<br/><br/>Vampire goal:<br/>Did I mention a lonely vampire has disguised themselves among the dinner guests? The goal for the original vampire is not to acquire items themselves, but to &quot;Turn&quot; human players that have already acquired items. You see, nothing tastes as good as hope. If a human is attacked and can&rsquo;t fend off the vampire, they are now secretly a vampire themselves looking for their victim. If the vampire is successfully fended off the vampire is not &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; and may become invisible (hidden player movement).  If the vampire turns a player, the new vampire gains points for the items they have already acquired but give the Vampire that turned them points as well. They do not give their &quot;Parent&quot; vampire points from the new victims they acquire. The closer a human player is to completing their goal the more valuable they are, but the more human players you &quot;Turn&quot; the more competition you make for yourself.  If you wait too long, they may be able to fend you off<br/><br/>The Clock:<br/>The old grandfather clock gongs on the hour, at which time a new event card is turned over. These events are random but become worse for the humans as the game progresses. The humans may skip an event if they place an item that turn. Do you help the other humans even though it may mean losing the game to avoid the next horrible event..it is up to you.<br/><br/>Does it sound simple? It is simple to learn, and as complex as the mind of the players that you play against.<br/><br/>"}, "212469": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3241741.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Aron Groot", "Niek Jansma"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": ["Golden Age Games"], "boardgameintegration": ["Captains of the Golden Age", "Captains of the Golden Age"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3241741_t.png", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Card Game", "Nautical", "Pirates"], "description": "ERRATA: Players can only buy one character per turn.<br/><br/>THE STORY<br/><br/>The infamous innkeeper has a curious grin on his face as he says &ldquo;Friends,how good of you to visit Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove inn again!

All players besides the start player may examine their cards, and place these however desired. The start player may only see his cards after choosing which card to begin with. He places his pawn on this card.<br/><br/>Most cards have a L, M, R, or C in their upper right corner. These stand for Left, Middle, Right, and Choice. When the start player reveals his start card, it determines where the next player places his pawn. This unleashes a chain of events. The last player's pawn placement will indicate the two to four movement options for the start player. (These are indicated by direction markers on each card.) His subsequent move will indicate the next player's move and so on. This can be treacherous given the players don't know the cards they are moving to until they make their moves. It is entirely possible that a player may be forced off of the board, or onto one of the more bizarre action cards.<br/><br/>1) FREEZE: If a player settles on this card, the next player in turn order may not move. Instead whichever card he previously settled on will indicate the next player's movement options.<br/><br/>2) LAVA: If a player stumbles into a lava pit, he loses one of his three pawns and starts over on the start card indicated by the lava card.<br/><br/>3) MIRROR MIRROR: If a player settles onto a Mirror Mirror card, the next player in turn order will move across the board to the card in the mirror position.<br/><br/>4) +PAWN: If a player settles onto a +Pawn card, he adds a second pawn to the start card of his choice. This increases his movement options, since he will still only move 1 pawn at a time. Therefore, his likelihood of reaching his destination is significantly increased.<br/><br/>5) REVERSE: If a player settles onto a Reverse card, the turn order is reversed, and the player who preceded him must move in the direction indicated by the card on which he is currently settled.<br/><br/>The game only uses 37 cards. There are 41 in total. But the remaining cards are not totally useless. While increasing the variety of the modular board, the cards also help to resolve conflicts if a player has settled onto a card where his opponent is currently positioned. Each card, excluding the Victory Card, has a number 1-40. When players are involved in a conflict, each draws a card at random, and the player with the higher card gains the space, whereas the player with the lower card loses his pawn.<br/><br/>Usually any cards revealed are left face-up, but there is also a Memory Variant where after moving to a new location, any cards not currently active are flipped back to face-down.<br/><br/>Due to the unique design of the game, it may also be played cooperatively, as players work together to lead one to the Victory Card.<br/><br/>The Clockwork Conundrum is an intense puzzle game. And due to its featuring nearly 100,000 ways to set up, it is highly replayable.

It was released on more computers than its predecessor including Acorn Electron, BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Amiga, DOS and RISC OS. The three individual games catered for children aged under 6 years, between 6 and 8 years and over 8 years respectively.<br/><br/>The Fun School 2 games were programmed using the STOS (derived from BASIC) programming language[8] with the STOS Compiler Engine. The previous year, the educational market was dwindling and the release of &quot;Fun School 2&quot; was an outstanding success. The games sold over 60,000 copies by February and by this time a German Amiga package was developed. By April the games sold over 100,000 copies. During August in 1990, over 150,000 copies had been sold (including 30,000 Amstrad CPC copies). During the development of &quot;Fun School 3&quot; by December, 250,000 copies of the games had been sold.<br/><br/>Fun School 2 was reviewed as &quot;The number one choice for our school&quot; by Shelley Gibson.

Use your influence to whisper in the ear of the magistrate, judge, governor or minister to protect some and have others arrested.
