An ancient evil, unearthed for the first time since antiquity, re-learning the limits of its power. A hero, noble and pious, unable to accept the responsibility that is his birthright. A child, shedding a single tear while waiting for her mother to return. Two lovers, intertwined in a bower, each speckled with red, red blood.<br/><br/>The Vampire is out there. You are it's enemies, its lovers and its servants. How will you confront the darkness awaiting you?<br/><br/>Annalise is a game about making Vampire stories. Each player takes on the role of a protagonist in the story you are about to create together, with the understanding that these characters are the victims, hunters and tools of the Vampire. The best example is that you are playing the story of Dracula with one person in the role of Mina Harker, one as Van Helsing, one as Renfield. The Vampire in your game, like Dracula, is what drives the plot, but it is not a protagonist. Every game of Annalise involves the characters discovering the influence of the Vampire in their lives, and builds up to a confrontation with the creature, for good or ill.<br/><br/>This is a game about pain, hunger and redemption. Pain, because the Vampire is only attracted to the vulnerable, those people who have experienced pain, suffering or loss in their lives. Hunger, because the Vampire hungers for that pain. Redemption, because there is always the possibility of redeeming your actions and desires - if you wish it.<br/><br/>Annalise is a game for two to four players, and can take a variable amount of time to play. A short, intense game can be played in four hours. A long, languid, slow-burning game can take up to 20 hours, broken into 3 or 4 hour sessions. The game is suited for people of all gaming backgrounds.<br/><br/>More information and play supplements are available at the website: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.findannalise.com' rel='nofollow'>http://www.findannalise.com</a><br/><br/>"}, "44018": {"rpgartist": ["Jim Clouse", "Jose Delbo", "Ed Hannigan", "Bob Smith"], "rpgitemversion": [null], "statistics": [], "name": "Night in Gotham", "rpgdesigner": ["Walter H.

In this game, players play werewolves (the Garou). The Garou believe they were made by Gaia to protect the weaker species and fight against The Wyrm, who tries to corrupt the world.<br/><br/>This book mainly deals with the different characters a player can create. A characters abilities are governed by three important facts: his breed, auspice and tribe.<br/><br/>Breed denotes the character's parents: a Homid had human parents, a Metis had (two) Garou parents (and is sterile himself) and a Lupus had wolf parents. A Homid will have more aptitude for dealing with humans, a Lupus will better know his way in the wilds, while the Metis has the best understanding of Garou culture.<br/><br/>Auspice is the moon under which the character was born, which determines his role in the pack:<br/>- Ragabash (New Moon - The Trickster: questioner of the ways)<br/>- Theurge (Crescent Moon - The Seer: searcher of the ways)<br/>- Philodox (Half Moon - The Judge: keeper of the ways)<br/>- Galliard (Gibbous Moon - The Moon Dancer: lover of the ways)<br/>- Ahroun (Full Moon - The Warrior: protector of the ways).<br/><br/>Tribe is the group of Garoun the character belongs to. These are like &quot;nations&quot; to the Garou, and have different territories and a different outlook on the world.<br/><br/>Character advancement is done in two ways. First of all, characters will earn experience and will grow in strenght because of that. However, a Garou also needs to accumulate Renown in order to advance in their society. Renown comes in three forms: Glory, Honor and Wisdom. A Garou will need all three to advance, though the emphasis does differ between the Auspices. An Ahroun will set less stock by Wisdom than a Theurge will.<br/><br/>"}, "44020": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jack A. Barker", "Louis J.

Instead of players co-operating on their adventures, in Paranoia they actively betray, lie, cheat and kill each other numerous times...accidently of course. The main aim of the game is comedy.<br/><br/>The game is set in a post-nuclear holocaust future of domed cities run by mega-computers. The players are Troubleshooters, clones with five other siblings who quickly step in when they are killed (nobody last very long in Paranoia). The PCs and NPCs live in an extremely strict colour coded hierarchy of Security Clearance, with Infra-Red submissive to Orange, which answers to Yellow and so on. Everybody, and I mean everybody, is insanely paranoid. The slightest mistake, the merest hint of treachery, could mean immediate execution. Because inside the dome, nobody knows that the war with the Commies was over centuries ago.<br/><br/>Players are subjected to constant propoganda 'The Computer Is Your Friend', encouraged to inform on their colleagues in special recording booths (which often broadcast the message by mistake), are given strange equipment without proper instructions, take pills, hide their secret allegiances and mutations and generally desperately try to survive.<br/><br/>The adventures are hopeless, ill-informed, pointless and suicidal missions which open with a briefing and end with a de-briefing, a golden opportunity to grass up the other players with highly subjective reports.<br/><br/>Being promoted to Orange Clearance gives a player enormous control over the others. Defying an order is Treason = immediate execution.<br/><br/>The GM is directly encouraged to kill PCs on any whim. PCs should be accused of Treason constantly, kept in ignorance and fear and generally shouted at and trampled on at all times (it's okay, they love it). To quote the rules &quot;Ignorance. Fear. Fear and ignornace. Dedicate yourself to these principles.&quot; As it says on the back cover, Catch-22 meets 1984!<br/><br/>First edition is a box set and contains mostly GM information; players are not encouraged to buy the rules or read the source material. In first edition there are a lot of rules, and the game is under West End Games d6 system, but you can mostly ignore them and run the game how you like. The GM can simply roll a bunch of dice behind a screen and say whatever they want anyway. All part of the paranoia. It's worth reading the book to immerse yourself in the theme and setting. There are lots of good catch phrases and tricks to pull on players.<br/><br/>The game really suits experienced RPG players. New players will not enjoy the game so much without the comparison to a normal RPG.<br/><br/>THE COMPUTER IS YOUR FRIEND!<br/><br/>Citizen, you are not authorized to read this.

Once Upon a Time... outlines the mechanics of character creation and game play, and includes seven sample characters for Players and Narrators alike to use as templates or inspiration. The Hut on Chicken Legs discusses the Faerie world and the kinds of adventures to be found there, and includes several sample Antagonists.

The 336pg softback book is packed with densely written, highly detailed information for a complex world of combat, magic, gods, demons, wolves and everything you could possibly need. Experienced D&amp;D players will find lots of familiar ideas and be able to slip into the palladium World easily. Inexperienced players may find the depth daunting, but all you need to play is in this book, character creation, combat, magic and so on.<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>The Second Edition Palladium Fantasy RPG is a dramatically revised and updated second edition of the original fantasy game rules - the first significant revision since its release in 1983.<br/><br/>Kevin Siembieda has personally wrote the comprehensive second edition, and had this to say:<br/><br/>&quot;The fantasy RPG is the game that launched my company and has been its cornerstone for over a decade. The fans love this game as much as I do, so the second edition will be true to the original, but more fun and detailed than ever before. Not only will it be completely compatible with Rifts and all of our other RPG&rsquo;s, but it will be the Rifts of fantasy gaming - epic fantasy adventure in a unique world, and offering possibilities that are limited only by the player&rsquo;s imagination!&quot;<br/><br/>The emphasis on the Second Edition will be on making the game better than ever, with clean, entertaining descriptions, exciting concepts, quick playability, and a better presentation of information and ideas.<br/><br/>The end result will be the first step into the bold and dangerous world of high fantasy. A world of magic and conflict. A world dominated by a human civilization built on the bones of the non-humans who reigned before them. A world of unparalleled heroic adventure filled with magic, inhuman creatures and intrigue!<br/><br/>The Palladium World is one of epic fantasy. A world torn in conflict with the non-human barbaric races, creatures of magic and supernatural forces.<br/><br/>Non-Human playing characters provide a host of unusual creatures as regular characters. They include the feared changeling who can assume the shape and appearance of any humanoid. The giant races of troll, ogre and wolfen. The small and agile goblin, kobold, gnome and the mighty dwarf, as well as elf, human, and dozens of &quot;optional&quot; creatures found in both the Palladium RPG and Monsters &amp; Animals.<br/><br/>The skill system embellishes characters with knowledge and abilities that make him or her more than a simple fighter or mage.<br/><br/>Combat is realistic, with strikes, parries, dodges and considerations for shields and armour. Yet it remains extremely quick and playable.<br/><br/>An Experience System in which characters are rewarded for acts of ingenuity, ideas, cunning, discretion, trickery and bravery. Not hack and slash.<br/><br/>Magic: Over 300 spells, plus elemental magic, circles, symbols and runes are yours to command. The most original forms of magic found only in the Palladium RPG are the Diabolist and Summoner. The Diabolist casts no spells, instead he uses the nearly forgotten magic of wards (mystic symbols) and circles of power. The Summoner too, is versed in the mystic arts of magic circle making, but his is a far more dangerous and often malevolent power, for he dares to summon and command creatures of magic.<br/><br/>The wizard, warlock, priest and other more traditional characters also break away from their more common game molds, with a vast array of spells and abilities that make them truly unique.<br/><br/>The Second Edition will Feature:<br/><br/><br/>     The addition of the S.D.C. system along with hit points. <br/>     An emphasis on characters and role-playing. <br/>     More world information and history. <br/><br/><br/>Clearer rules and information. <br/><br/>     More skills (and less clumsy charts). <br/>     More equipment and world information. <br/>     New cover and new, great artwork by Siembieda, Martin, Post, and McKenna. <br/>     The same great Occupational Character Classes and Racial Character Classes like the Long Bowman, Paladin, Diabolist, Mind Mage, Assassin, Changeling, Wolfen, Ogre, Elf, Faerie Folk, and others. Plus a few new one <br/>     The same great magic system, but modified to the P.P.E. system. <br/>     The same great psionics powers and I.S.P. system. <br/>     The same quick playing combat and balanced game system. <br/>     Over 20 Character Classes plus a dozen different player races (like the Wolfen, Changeling, elf, etc.) <br/>     Wizard O.C.C. with over 300 spells. <br/>     Diabolist O.C.C. with 60 wards and 50 magic circles. <br/>     Rune weapons, magic items, curses and more. <br/>     A unique world of heroic adventure and magic. <br/>     And for long-time fans, the changes, although significant, will NOT make the old edition RPG and sourcebooks completely obsolete. With a little modification, the new and old material can be made completely compatible! No stupid changes, we promise. <br/>     Now suitable for use with Rifts, Heroes Unlimited, and the entire Megaverse. <br/>     Fast playing combat, powerful magic, and loads of fun.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "44050": {"rpgartist": ["Steve Bryant", "Paul Daly", "Liz Danforth", "LaMont Fullerton", "Rick Harris", "David G.

No one is allowed to cross the cordon; they&rsquo;re turned back for &ldquo;security reasons&rdquo; to protect &ldquo;a wonderful scientific breakthrough.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Meanwhile, on the coast, people are disappearing in the woods. But locals insist that there is no reason to be alarmed. People do get lost in the wilderness, and rural regions have been known to attract wandering axe murderers on occasion. No need to propose some great &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo; theory to explain a few missing persons, or even several grisly deaths.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a little harder to explain whole cars disappearing &ndash; with everyone inside &ndash; as they travel down a busy highway. But it isn&rsquo;t impossible. Perhaps these people don&rsquo;t want to be found.<br/>Or maybe there really is something dark and sinister going on.

Are there other worlds in the proto-dimensions, other races -- allies or enemies?

There are rules for proto-dimensional travel by means of empathic power or by the use of technological devices far beyond the ability of humans to create. All the details of dimension-walking are covered, telling how to stay alive while doing it. Players will learn how to build an interdimensional portal -- or how to destroy one.<br/><br/>Further, the Proto-Dimensions Sourcebook describes 12 different proto-dimensions, ranging from tropical paradise to a sulphurous hell, from the vastness of a perpetual sky to surreal landscapes populated by creatures from out of a nightmare, from a world where everything is normal except for the color to a world where nothing is as it seems.<br/><br/>If you are a Dark Conspiracy referee, you will be able to incorporate the proto-dimensions into your campaign with relative ease.

They are fighting their private wars for power, while trying not to lose themselves to the Beast.<br/><br/>During the Dark Ages, the vampires are still less careful than they are in later times. And often, they don't need to be. Humans are far less organised; things that happen in an isolated cottage are less likely to attract attention than something happening in a 20th century apartment building. There are no foes with high-tech weapons.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is much to fear as well. There are few places to hide from the sun. Civilisation has not gained that much ground from the wilderniss, and the werewolves abound in that wilderniss. Also, little is happening at night. There are few shops to supply the vampires, and the Cainites' nightly activities are much more likely to draw unwanted attention.<br/><br/>This book mainly deals with the different characters a player can create. A characters abilities are mostly governed by his clan, which is the same as the clan of the vampire who sired him. For the embrace, the creation of a new vampire, a vampire will usually select a person that will fit his clan.<br/><br/>Another important aspect is the Road the character will follow: the mortal code he followes that keeps him from giving in to the Beast and becoming a mindless monster.<br/><br/>"}, "44079": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jason Carl", "Andy Collins", "Monte Cook", "Bruce R.

We replenished our supplies, patched up the ship, and traded our remaining goods at native villages along the shores of several islands. Some villages were friendly, but others were hostile and the natives attacked on sight. I suspect the hostile villages were filled with cannibals.<br/><br/>We skirted the coastlines of several islands, sailing south by west until we reached a small peninsula cut off from the main island by a massive stone wall. We were well received by the natives of Tanoroa, the small village that guards this wall. The villagers have no name for the large island other than the 'Isle of Dread'. Their own small peninsula is known simply as 'Home'.<br/><br/>The villagers told us a tale about an ancient city in the central highland of the isle that was build by the same people who built the wall. The villagers call the builders 'the gods', but I noticed that the names of the gods and the personal names of the clan ancestors were often the same. I believe that the natives once possessed a much more advanced culture and that the descendants of the builders have returned to a more primitive state.<br/><br/>The inland city is rumored to be filled with treasure beyond imagining. In particular, I heard persistent tales concerning a great black pearl of 'the gods' that still remains in the inland city. The island waters abound with excellent pearl beds, so the rumor of the black pearl may well be true.<br/><br/>The village contains a number of huge life-like statues of iron, bronze and stone. Since no villager currently has the skill or the craft to make such statues, the tale of a lost city built by the 'gods' seems reasonable. I would have liked to explore inland to verify the rumors, but too many crewmen died in the storm or by cannibal spears. Only five of us are left. I am the only professional adventurer, the others are only sailors. We can sail the small ship well enough but on land, in hostile territory, we would be helpless. Once back in Specularum I should be able to recruit a new crew and a party of professional adventurers, then I will return to claim the great black pearl.<br/><br/>One thing I managed to do before leaving: we sailed around the island and made the best map we could. We were afraid to land, since village fishermen had warned us that it was extremely dangerous to land anywhere on the main island and the coasts were rocky with no beaches. As a result, the map only shows the coastal areas we could chart from the ship, but it is better than nothing.<br/><br/>-Rory Barbarosay&quot;<br/><br/>"}, "44093": {"rpgdesigner": ["Aaron Allston", "Jonatha Ariadne Caspian", "Doug Kaufman", "Sandy Petersen", "Bill Slavicsek", "Greg Stafford", "Michael Stern", "C.

The cardboard cover acts as the GM screen with a grid map and an isometric map showing the depths of the dungeon.<br/><br/>The silver dragon Falx Templamut has called for help. Five potions of Silver Dragon Control have been stolen from his lair by underground forces. Falx offers wonderful rewards if you can return each of the potions, but you must face well organised foes possibly lead by a Vampire.<br/><br/>Title page blurb:<br/>An RPGA&reg; AD&amp;D&reg; Tournament Module for 6 characters, levels 5 - 9<br/><br/>Falx, a silver dragon and nephew of old Bahamut himself, has a problem.

Once the game's focus shifts to more personal cooking battles, the action stays hot for non-active players who are invited to take on alternate roles that continue to shape the story.<br/><br/>"}, "44215": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jean-Marie Baveux", "jim pinto", "Rob Vaux", "John Wick", "Jennifer Wick", "Kevin Wilson", "Ray Yand"], "rpg": ["7th Sea"], "poll": [], "name": "Montaigne", "rpgartist": ["Paul Daily", "Daerick Gross", "Paul Herbert", "Rob Hinds", "Steve Hough", "Cristina McAllister", "Terese Nielsen", "Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez", "Kevin Sanborn"], "rpgproducer": ["Brendon Goodyear", "Steve Hough", "jim pinto", "Janice Sellers", "D.

A fantasy role-playing game is one in which the players (sometimes one, often several) can assume the personas and personalities of imaginary beings - not always human - who are thus given lives and adventures of their own, directed by the game players.<br/><br/>In the course of the game, characters (the imaginary ones) are presented with circumstances created in outline by a Game Master. The fulfillment of that outline depends upon a verbal give-and-take between the Game Master and the players as they explore the world presented, taking actions to cope with the situations in which they find themselves.<br/><br/>The Game Master is a real person who has taken the time to create the scenarios in which his or her friends can play. The players may be using medieval knights, space-faring aliens, or a cowpuncher from the old west.<br/><br/>Tunnels &amp; Trolls is designed primarily as a fantasy role-playing game set in a somewhat medieval alternate-universe, in the tradition of the hero tales of Greece and Rome, the Norse sagas and the Eddas, childhood fairy tales, and in the more modern traditions of the heroic fantasy of JRR Tolkein and Robert E. Howard.<br/><br/>The fundamental framework for adventuring in Tunnels &amp; Trolls is the concept of an underground tunnel complex wherein dangerous traps and deadly monsters guard undreamed-of treasures, where magic and high sorcery meet sword and shield, in alliance or as violent opponents. Those who survive to regain the surface may be considered &quot;winners&quot; - until the next time they venture into the depths, risking their all for glory, gold and adventure.<br/><br/>The rules to play Tunnels &amp; Trolls are complete with the booklet in your hands. You need never purchase anything else, and you will have the entire game available to you. On the other hand, there are numerous back-up services - among them, solitaire dungeon adventures, miniatures, and a magazine dedicated primarily to T&amp;T - but these are meant to augment the game. Here is all you'll need.<br/><br/>We hope you'll enjoy the game.<br/><br/>User summary: This fifth edition of the Tunnels &amp; Trolls core rules book is dated from 1979. Topics in the book include introductory information, character types, magic, sequence of combat events, monsters, being a game master, treasures, languages, character races, and weapons.<br/><br/>"}, "44225": {"rpgdesigner": ["Kevin Boerwinkle", "Loren Dean", "Lee Garvin", "Ree Soesbee", "Celia Tite"], "rpg": ["7th Sea"], "poll": [], "name": "Ussura", "rpgartist": ["Carl Frank", "Brendon Goodyear", "Daerick Gross", "A.

Only a few, however, can overcome their fear and dare to look deeper.<br/><br/>Abandon Hope All Who Enter<br/>The World of Darkness Rulebook introduces a version of our contemporary world where the supernatural is real. Players join to tell tales of mystery and horror, where theme, mood and plot are more important to a character&rsquo;s experiences than his weapons or equipment. Inside are rules for character creation, task resolution, combat and any activity your character attempts as he delves into the shadows.<br/><br/>This is the core rulebook for the new World Of Darkness (WoD) RPG from White Wolf Game Studio published in 2004. This rules set unifies the Storytelling system. In order to play the new WoD games, you need this core rules book and, if you wish, the Supplement for the setting you want to play, such as Vampire: The Requiem, which contains rules specific to that setting.<br/><br/>", "rpgmechanic": ["Dice (Primarily d10)"], "rpgsetting": ["Chronicles of Darkness"], "average": "7.31027", "rpgissuearticle": ["Hunters Hunted", "It's a Small WOD After All", "Murder in the Red Barn: A NWoD Scenario in Brisbane", "New World of Darkness Reviewed", "The new World of Darkness rulebook: Step into the Shadows", "News from the Front: Classifieds", "News from the Front: MADS Role Playing System", "News from the Front: The World of Darkness", "Nowy, wspania\u0142y \u015bwiat?", "Review: White Wolf - World of Darkness", "The Jail of Night", "The Mechanics of Fear and Madness", "World of Darkness Core Rulebook", "World of Darkness Releases"], "rpgartist": ["Thom Ang", "Samuel Araya", "Tim Bradstreet", "Anna Harper", "Jeremy Jarvis", "Becky Jollensten", "Michael Kaluta", "David Leri", "Jason Manley", "Mark A.

They failed, but the attempt left the world in rapidly darkening shadow. Dead souls returned to claim living bodies, creating blood-drinking undead fiends: vampires. Bestial spirits came as well, to create werewolves, and demons formed bodies from worldly matter. Magic crashed back into the world, and mages wield its power for whatever purpose suits them. Humans called the Awakened unknowingly keep the darkness at bay. These supernatural creatures struggle against each other and clash in the shadows, most attempting to destroy the world, but a few fighting to preserve it. And over it all, the Iconnu still lurk, squeezing the world like an eggshell.<br/><br/>This book include a complete setting: a new vision of the World of Darkness.<br/><br/>Characters play as vampires, mages, werewolves, demons or Awakened and wield frightening supernatural powers against their own kind.

Players take the roles of regular folks much like themselves, who are inexorably drawn into confrontation with the creatures of the Outer Black, an unearthly realm of alien menace. With or without its distinctive mythology, GMs can use it to replicate the shudders and shocks of the horror genre in both film and literature. It's powered by the GUMSHOE system introduced in The Esoterrorists.<br/><br/>Fear Itself serves as an ideal platform for one-shot games, in which, like any self-respecting horror flick, few, if any, of the protagonists are expected to survive the climax. It can also be employed to run ongoing campaigns in which the leading characters gradually discover more about the disturbing supernatural reality hiding in the shadows of the ordinary world. Over time, they grow more adept at combating them-or spiral tragically into insanity and death.<br/><br/>Fear Itself Characters<br/>Characters in Fear Itself have numerous hooks which make them perfect for horror adventures.<br/><br/>- Risk Factors determine why your character goes down into the dark basement. If you don't follow your risk factor, your sanity can suffer. <br/>- Stability - your resistance to insanity - has been more thoroughly detailed, and linked to your sources of stability, friends, family, beliefs and pastimes. <br/>- You can include psychics with powerful but sanity threatening abilities such as Premonition, Remote Viewing and Synchronicty. <br/>- Each player defines The Worst Thing they Ever Did, which the GM and players can use to inform the characters behaviour and fears. <br/>- Each character describes their initial attitude to the other PCs, including who they like or dislike. This can be based on initial impressions or intimate knowledge.<br/><br/>Creating and Running Adventures<br/>The looser structure of a Fear Itself scenario still consists of an investigative line, in which the characters pursue a series of core clues until they achieve a resolution of some sort. The GM or players can introduce flashbacks or directed scenes usually to address a character issue (for example The Worst Thing They Ever Did) or relationship with a source of stability or PC. Additional Unremitting Horror creatures including the fearsome Mystery Man are offered as foils.<br/>Fear Itself includes masses of advice for the GM and players on how to run a horror game, and a detailed adventure The Ocean in the Forest.<br/><br/>"}, "44380": {"rpgartist": ["Mathieu Gasperin", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Huguenin"], "rpgitemversion": ["Hardcover Version", "Mutant City Blues - Spanish Edition", "PDF version", "Softcover Edition"], "statistics": [], "name": "Mutant City Blues", "rpgdesigner": ["Robin D.

My reaction to the latter was, 'I want to see this movie!'&quot;<br/><br/>-Robin D Laws, creator of the Esoterrorists <br/> James Semple, sound designer and musician offers you four new contemporary tracks for your Esoterrorists game, or any game of contemporary horror. The music here incorporates contemporary rhythms, electric guitars and sound design elements in addition to the expected orchestral and cinematic elements.<br/> The Tracks <br/>The Esoterrorists Theme: This music has been written to introduce a session of the game. It begins by hinting at the mystery and horror using sound design and a female vocal. The music then shifts into a faster rhythm culminating in the action theme of the game. The heavy drums and insistent violin ostinato are overlaid with distorted powerchords and squealing lead guitar lines representing the contemporary edge of the game. This track prototypes the sonic palette of the Esoterrorists mixing elements of rock, orchestra and dance music. You can hear a lower quality version of the track here.<br/><br/>Special Suppression Forces: Although much of the Ordo Veritatis work is based on investigation, there comes a time when action is needed and the Special Suppression Forces are called in. This track reflects the overtly military nature of this force and the dangers that they face. The music relies on a lot of very heavy percussion from Japanese taikos and similar instruments but also includes contemporary instrumentation. Eventually the piece closes with a restatement of the main action motif but with even heavier percussion than before.<br/><br/>Little Girl Lost: This track was designed to be played alongside the adventure Albion's Ransom: Little Girl Lost. The feeling behind the track was to create a mood evoking the urban and spiritual backdrop of this story. There's clearly a strong trance and trip-hop influence here. Furthermore, the minor harmony and dark instrumentation hint at the underlying peril and mystery. Again a contemporary instrumentation integrates with orchestra, drum loops and voices.<br/><br/>The Membrane: The Esoterrorists use the media to help spread fear and weaken the membrane. The music here is suggestive of that influence and is a mixture of percussion, sound design and ambient ideas. Even the main theme is incorporated into this collage of sound although in a twisted manner, sometimes in reverse. Unlike the other tracks to date, The Membrane is specifically designed as background music, to be looped at low levels in the background in times of tension.<br/><br/>"}, "44393": {"rpgdesigner": ["Timothy B.

Talented musician James Semple has created four tracks specially for Pelgrane Press to enhance your horror roleplaying experience.<br/><br/>Trail of Cthulhu features elements of tension and horror but also thoughtful and considered investigation and dramatic moments of revelation. The music here is designed to play beneath those key moments to help enhance the all-important atmosphere of the game.

The Golden Age scores of film composers such as Franz Waxman and Bernard Herrmann were particularly inspiring.<br/><br/>Trail of Cthulhu Theme (Pulp)<br/>The Pulp theme emphasizes the action scenes of a typical game, inducing excitement, and depicting an encroaching terror and a desperate flight to safety.<br/><br/>Ruminations<br/>Ruminations was written for a classic investigative scene. Many times I've found players puzzling over the clues they have for long periods.

The opening of this track is a whole minute of anticipation in sound design building into the orchestra and vocal chorus.<br/><br/>Trail of Cthulhu Theme (Purist)<br/>To open a game played in the purist style, this theme conveys a sense of a mystery and a brooding threat just out of sight but constantly lurking and waiting.<br/><br/>"}, "44411": {"rpgartist": ["Chris Appel", "Christophe Swal"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Portuguese PDF version", "Saddle Stapled (modules/pamphlets)"], "poll": [], "name": "Coffin Rock", "rpgdesigner": ["Jennifer Dornan", "Sean Michael Fish"], "rpgproducer": ["Aaron Acevedo", "Travis Anderson", "Dave Blewer", "Robin Elliott", "Piotr Kory\u015b", "Simon Lucas", "Paul \"Wiggy\" Wade-Williams"], "usersrated": "10", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic500879.jpg", "rpgmechanic": ["Attribute/Stat Based (STR, CON, PER, etc)", "Cards (cards drive the action)", "Dice (Various)", "Exploding Dice (Die may 'explode' into a second roll)", "Skill Based (buy or gain skills)"], "rpgsetting": ["The Weird West"], "average": "6.9", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Deadlands: Reloaded", "Savage Worlds"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pinnacle Entertainment Group", "RetroPunk Game Design", "Studio 2 Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["History (American West)", "Horror", "Weird / Surreal"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic500879_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the 30-page, full-color supplement:<br/><br/>&quot;A Town Sliding into Hell!<br/><br/>The mining town of Coffin Rock, Colorado, is a seething cauldron of trouble.<br/><br/>The local soiled doves are making a killing, some say ghosts walk the streets, and a mad serial killer is on the loose.

Driven by the febrile compulsions of the committed bibliophile, you slip inside. Soon you find yourself in its ill-lit basement, the stench of rotting paper assailing your nostrils. Ducking down, your fingers lunge for a cardboard box filled with curled, yellow-edged old magazines.<br/><br/>The lurid covers assault your senses! Can it be? Though you consider yourself an expert on the pulp magazines of the thirties, these titles are oddly unfamiliar to you. You scan the cover stories-each is an exemplar of its time, yet infused by a distinctly Lovecraftian sensibility.<br/><br/>- Devourers In the Mist: A rugged adventure tale in which the survival of island castaways is tested not only by the elements - but by the twisted shapes of half-seen, sadistic entities who haunt the atoll&rsquo;s jungled interior! <br/>- Shanghai Bullets: Guns-blazing danger portends and international intrigue unfurls in the city of conspiracy, the licentious, opium-infused Berlin of the East. In the shadow struggle between nations, no weapon is more fiercely coveted than the star mirror. It brings blood-draining death from beyond the stars! <br/>- Death Laughs Last : When philanthropist and gadabout Addison Bright is found bizarrely murdered in his own New York mansion, only a team of doughty investigators can protect his reputation-and the sanity of mankind-from the awful truths lurking in his tragically colorful past. <br/>- Dimension Y : A scientific experiment yields the promise of a glimpse into an adjoining reality, a repository of man&rsquo;s dreams and memories. But when the heroes peer through this window... they find cosmic horror peering back at them!<br/><br/>A bang resounds above your head - the basement door slamming shut. You&rsquo;re trapped in the crypt of impossible pulps! But before you meet your deserved fate, you can take your final pleasures in this collection of exciting pulp-style scenarios for Trail Of Cthulhu , the GUMSHOE game of Lovecraftian investigative horror.<br/><br/>"}, "44420": {"rpgartist": ["Cindy Baker", "William H.

Yes, the Aces &amp; Eights: Shattered Frontier RPG is the highest quality, most complete western ever marketed in the adventure game industry. Just be sure to keep plenty of tissue nearby - the drool-factor on this product is through the roof!<br/><br/>First, there&rsquo;s the innovative and visual Shot Clock game aids, which eliminate the abstraction and complexity of other RPGs &ndash; a player can actually see the cover, position and location of his or her target! Of course, the Shot Clock game aids aren&rsquo;t the only innovation in the Aces &amp; Eights game. For instance, the game has a new poker chip-based brawling system that solves the problem of &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; damage; characters actually become winded, tired or knocked senseless in the fight. The realistically deadly combat supports an overall game system that rewards characters for pursuing professions, giving players the in-game incentives to do much more than follow the outlaw trail.<br/><br/>In addition, the Aces &amp; Eights RPG is the first western to not just allow, but focus on, the rest of the major western movie adventures beyond the gunfight. Prospecting, cattle drives, frontier justice, and so on, all have a complete &ldquo;mini game&rdquo; system tailored for that type of adventure. In fact, the Aces &amp; Eights game has over two score available professions covering the full range of possibilities in the Wild West! With no levels or classes (and only gaining experience in skills used), characters can change professions at will, just like the Old West!<br/><br/>The full-color maps and 25 pages of history provide such details as minor politicians and military officers (based on real historical figures), making the background spring to life like no other game has. And with the USA, CSA, Republic of Texas, Deseret, Mexico, France, England and dozens of Indian nations all vying for control of this alternate history setting, the Shattered Frontier is far wilder than the historical Wild West ever was!<br/><br/>Whether you prefer simple shoot-'em-ups or on-going campaigns, this is the western RPG you simply can&rsquo;t afford to miss!<br/><br/>"}, "44447": {"rpgartist": ["Megan Drohan", "Phil Hilfiker", "Kevin Jeong", "Mark Krajnak", "Josh Lunde", "Caterina Mendolicchio", "Forest Purnell", "Adam Scheutze", "Daniel Solis", "Greg Stolze"], "rpgitemversion": ["Cubicle 7 Entertainment Printing", "PDF version", "Soft Cover"], "poll": [], "name": "A Dirty World", "rpghonor": ["2008 Indie RPG Awards - Game of the Year - Runner Up", "2008 Indie RPG Awards - Most Innovative Game - Runner Up"], "rpgproducer": ["Daniel Solis"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic639383.jpg", "usersrated": "28", "rpgdesigner": ["Greg Stolze"], "average": "6.72679", "rpgissuearticle": ["Voll Indie Fresse: A Dirty World"], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Pulp)", "Crime (Criminal / Law Enforcement)", "Crime (Mystery / Detective / Noir)"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Self-Published)", "Cubicle 7 Entertainment", "Schroedinger's Cat Press"], "rpg": ["A Dirty World"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgpodcastepisode": ["A Dirty World: A Very Thorough Murder part 1", "A Dirty World: A Very Thorough Murder part 2", "A Dirty World: A Very Thorough Murder part 3", "A Dirty World: Andrew\u2019s Fortune part 1", "A Dirty World: Andrew\u2019s Fortune part 2", "A Dirty World: Cottonwood \u2013 Part 1", "A Dirty World: Cottonwood \u2013 Part 2", "A Dirty World: Dr. Nova\u2019s Going Away Party", "A Dirty World: Long Island", "A Dirty World: The Buyout", "A Dirty World: The Dangers of Fraternization", "A Dirty World: Wages of Sin"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic639383_t.jpg", "description": "A roleplaying game of angry decisions, ugly ethics, and black city streets.

Your character consists, primarily, of three &quot;influences,&quot; or possible life callings. These might include anything from choosing to marry for love instead of political gain to choosing the life of a soldier over that of a courtly diplomat. Whatever the character is struggling with, he spends his time forming alliances and developing other connections to each influence. But with choice comes loss. As your character slowly progresses towards an inevitable end he will lose friends and ability along the way. The more he specializes, the better he becomes, but also the more he must give up.
