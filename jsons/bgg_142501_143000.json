Little bothered by the smattering of slow climbing American P-40 fighters subsequently rushed to the area, high flying Japanese planes raided the Northern Territories an average of four times a month during 1942.<br/><br/>This changed dramatically in early 1943 when the rapidly expanding RAAF deployed an entire wing of British built Spitfires to Darwin. Led by Australian ace Clive &ldquo;Killer&rdquo; Caldwell, the Spitfires quickly and forcibly confronted the Japanese. At this same time, the RAAF fielded another famous British fighter, the long-range, twin engine Beaufighter. These fast, ten-gun behemoths had an offensive role, ranging far and wide to attack Japanese bases and shipping as far away as Timor, Rabaul and all of New Guinea. Mid-1943 also saw the deployment of the Boomerang to New Guinea. This nimble homegrown fighter, though lacking in air combat ability, proved excellent as a ground support plane.  Thus, whether defending the north, sweeping the seas or bombing bunkers, Australian aircrews and their planes, were a decisive factor in reversing the Japanese fortunes of war in 1943.<br/><br/>Top Cover No.1: This is the first Fighting Wings game system expansion to be produced.

Developed for the modern tabletop miniatures wargamer, this book brings players the ability to wage war on land, sea, and air using the Quick-Strike game system in BattleTech: Strategic Operations. BattleTech: Alpha Strike, like its forerunner Quick-Strike, draws upon a hybridization of the BattleForce rules also available in Strategic Operations, together with the miniature game rules presented in that same volume which allow for hexless terrain play. BattleTech: Alpha Strike includes support for both hex-based and hexless game play.<br/><br/>In BattleTech: Alpha Strike, themed around the Clan Invasion, each BattleMech (or other game unit) is represented using a series of Unit Cards, which are highly abstracted derivations of the respective Record Sheet for each unit in &quot;classic&quot; BattleTech. (While BattleForce uses the same abstraction to group 'Mechs into lances, Stars, centuries, or level IIs, BattleTech: Alpha Strike should treat each 'Mech as an individual unit.)<br/><br/>As with &quot;classic&quot; BattleTech, a player's goal is to use his force to achieve his objectives, which generally involves the defeat or destruction of opposing forces. However, the game's use of BattleForce Unit Cards and rule options allow it to play at a much faster (though less intricately detailed) level of play than &quot;classic&quot; BT.

All sales data for Crabitron, such as revenue and chart position, are made available to the public directly on the Crabstarter website.<br/><br/>Two Lives Left co-founder Simeon Sa&euml;ns comments, &ldquo;We'll be making all of our sales data public. You'll be able to see exactly how much we're earning, whether Crabitron is succeeding or failing, and where it sits in the charts.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Two Lives Left has estimated that Crabitron cost approximately $100,000 to develop, and this has become the funding goal for their Crabstarter campaign. In addition, Two Lives Left has added &ldquo;stretch goals&rdquo; for additional features and updates to Crabitron once the initial funding goal has been reached.<br/><br/>Source: The Developer Website.<br/><br/>"}, "142610": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "poll": [], "name": "Rescue Run", "rpgdesigner": ["Colin  Dunn"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1681695.png", "usersrated": "1", "rpgsetting": ["2300 AD"], "average": "6", "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Hard Sci Fi)"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["2300 AD (Mongoose)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Mongoose Publishing"], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpgseries": ["Grendelssaga"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1681695_t.png", "description": "publisher blurb<br/><br/>Rescue Run is the first adventure in the Grendelssaga, a series of three adventures set on the rogue world of Grendel, in the Queen Alice&rsquo;s Star system.

Each player receives a character card that comes with a unique set of special abilities and determines which side they&rsquo;re on. Two factions battle to find a winner using one of two victory conditions:<br/><br/>1.    Finish a round with the entire opposing team knocked out.<br/>2.

Every Character Card has a brief background description for those who have not read the graphic novels.<br/><br/>Over 100 Item and Luck cards with unique illustrations created just for this game are drawn each turn and equipped to increase your character&rsquo;s attributes.  The Item deck contains weapons and other helpful cards such as the Thompson Gun, Experimental Gas Launcher, and bandages. The luck deck contains esoteric items such as curses, lucky helmets, spells, and more. Using these cards you and your faction attack opposing players each round and attempt to get to thirteen on the scorecard. Each damage you inflict on an opposing player gets them closer to being knocked out and moves your team up one point on the scorecard.<br/><br/>The game also comes with 21 Chapter Cards. These cards are drawn each time you score a point and allow you to play through the plot of various Adventures of the 19XX books.

After your laser is fired, it takes two seconds to recharge and for the asterisk to reappear.

It will usually be possible to recall an intruder that has recently moved off the screen.<br/><br/>The time remaining is displayed in the upper right, and the score is shown in the upper left. There are three different types of intruders, each having a different point value. These are the Z-shaped space probe, the triangular alien space ship, and the cosmic intruder himself.

Players also have control over the game's length and Autumn can arrive unexpectedly.<br/><br/>The basic two-player game has no structural hidden elements, it consists only of 11 red tiles, 13 blue tiles and 15 yellow tiles, and the rules are easily adaptable for thematic additions and personal variants.<br/><br/>"}, "142653": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2037878.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jacob Leeman"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2014", "maxplayers": "4", "age": "8", "boardgamepublisher": ["V3G"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2037878_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "description": "In IncrediBrawl, each player guides a colorful cast of characters from all corners of the imagination as they meet in an epic clash for glory!

That essentially makes an entire bestiary a source of a couple hundred schticks, despite the massive pricetag attached to it. Featured Creatures takes a different approach. Imagine, if you will, some simple statblocks with equally simple rules for the addition of a bunch of newfangled abilities. Say we start with a dinosaur. One breathes fire. One provokes fear. One has these nasty little pus sacs that randomly burst with a chewy baby dinosaur center from time to time. The point is this one creature is fulfilling multiple things without the need for a new entry. The idea is modular.<br/><br/>Following in this vein, Featured Creatures: Golems  introduces the Filigree Golem. Built to also fulfill the role of decorative item, the filigree golem presents a stealthy, modular chassis that can range anywhere from CR 2 to CR 11, depending on which special abilities you slap onto it. For ease of use, the statblocks for this creature from CR 2 to CR 6 are included, and simple rules are presented for further advancement all the way to CR 11.

The Army with the highest total amount is victorious. In the event of a tie, the attacker has the option of continuing the attack or retreat. If discretion is the better part of valor and retreat is the desired course of action then the attacker rolls 1 die and moves away from the defender the number of spaces indicated by the die.

The game is presented as a generic ruleset, all players need is available using components they can build themselves or from other games and toys - most players won't need to buy anything they don&rsquo;t own already.<br/><br/>The game lets players build giant monsters, called colossi, using three types of Power Cards: Abilities, Attacks and Specials. Abilities represent the inherent skills and characteristics of the colossus. Specials are the unexpected and unique moves which colossi can perform in battle. Attacks and Attack modifiers represent any weapons and ways of fighting that the colossus might have including claws, teeth, horns, laser beams, rockets, atomic breath, a sharp beak, fireballs, etc.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 1/600 tabletop with no hexes or squares. There are 6 types of terrain: cities, hazardous, wet, high, tricky or industrial parks. Given the huge size of the colossi, these are little more than nuisances to their inexorable advance.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns broken in 8 phases: Air Strike Planning (determine where they land - random), Orders (draw Orders Cards and assign them to colossi under your command), Movement (move colossi based on Order Card), Ranged Attack (use Ranged Attacks if any), Close Attack (use Close Attacks if any), Tinies (move the human defenders towards closes colossus and attack it), Air Strike Attack (roll for damage on colossi under air strike coordinates), End (remove markers, check if somebody won, etc). The game ends when a side's colossi have all been knocked out or when a scenario's victory conditions are met (the rules come with 6 scenarios)<br/><br/>Colossus! comes with its own setting called The Zillium Wars which is featured in little snippets across the rules. This story-world has been deliberately left vague and open to the player&rsquo;s imagination. A range of possible colossi are suggested as starting points, but players are free to come up with their own concepts and model them using the cards available... or even invent their own cards! Hopefully there will be enough active players out there feeding back on the rules and how they use them so I can keep improving and expanding Colossus!<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First Edition"], "age": "12", "name": "Colossus!", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Monsters"]}, "142750": {"statistics": [], "name": "Nyko Wii Charge Station", "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Add-On"], "usersrated": "1", "average": "9", "videogamehwmfg": ["Nyko"], "poll": [], "videogamehwversion": ["Black Charge Station Duo", "Black Charge Station Quad", "White Charge Station Duo", "White Charge Station Quad"], "videogamehardware": ["Wii", "Wii U"], "description": "Easily charge and store your Wii Remotes with Nyko&rsquo;s Charge Station for Wii.

The only difference? You won't know how this script is going to play out. Those matches and segments will affect the company you are trying to run, growing it into a global phenomen or watching it crumble before your eyes.<br/><br/>Of course, you can also play in a group adding one, very important element - each person takes the role (or several roles) of a wrestler. Narrate a segment or cut a promo on your opponent and it will impact the mechanics of the game and your wrestler&rsquo;s options in the ring. And once the bell rings, not only does the mechanics allow you to choose what moves your wrestler does, but it gives you a beginning set of tactics drawn from the real-life wrestling world, tactics to attempt (each with their own advantages and disadvantages).<br/><br/>This FULL RULEBOOK adds several different match-types (cage, extreme, tag, triangle, battle royal). In addition, the advanced rules continue adding depth by introducing aspects to the game mechanic that turn up the realism such as: Counter ability, Weight &amp; Height, Manager's impact, Intimidation,  Stamina (fatigue, injury, tag team fatigue, wearing an opponent down, wrestling with injuries), blood, referees that impact the match, wrestler's individual advantages &amp; disadvantages, how to make a wrestler and let him grow into an Icon of the wrestling world as well as a world for that wrestler to exist - including 21 original, fully illustrated wrestlers existing within a backdrop as wide-open as your imagination.

Cornell took the promotion national and put on live events, as well as selling DVDs, for years all across the US. Cornell inserted himself as a star of the show, along with such wrestlers as Liberty, Rick Law, BLZ Bubb, Painful Procedure (the champion tag team composing of BJ Shearer and Randall Hopkirk, plus Ronnie V. Pain), the Demons of Rage, and Madman Boone.

With the development of navigation in the adjacent waters a lighthouse was erected. Its main function was to ensure that the sailors do not run off course and thereby are not caught by numerous pirates or the neighbouring inhabitants minotaurs. At the beginning of the construction, an interesting discovery was made. A strange abandoned place resembling a sanctuary, possibly from an unknown civilization, was found deep under ground on the island. The only artifact inside was a blade fragment. So it was decided to keep the blade in the basement of the lighthouse. Ever since then, the island has beared its name. Once the lighthouse was built, the Emperor Agalar sent one of his old warriors to the Blade Island to supervise the lighthouse. During four long years, everything had taken its normal course until the island became haunted by the mysterious, disturbed spirits of sailors who suffered numerous shipwrecks in the surrounding waters&hellip; Shortly after, the light from Blade Island disappeared. Nobody on Ekzularis could ever imagine the reason for it&hellip;Due to an unstable military state on Ekzularis, the Emperor Agalar could only assume that it was the act of sabotage organized by the unruly minotaurs. With the pending arrival of the powerful magician on Ekzularis, one of his apprentices was teleported to Blade Island. During the whole week there was absolutely no news from her.

Ravaged Earth not only brings it to you in spades, but also in diamonds, hearts, and (jazz) clubs.<br/><br/><br/>About the Setting<br/><br/>In 1898, the Martians tried to take over, but we got lucky and they left, died off, or whatever. Now, over thirty years later, they&rsquo;re back. Persistent buggers, ain&rsquo;t they?<br/><br/>We&rsquo;re not totally unprepared. Aetherium, what we commonly call the Martian metal, has altered some folks and given them the power to fight back. While most of them live on the fringes, we need each and every one of them if we&rsquo;re going to keep them from taking over. Aren&rsquo;t we?<br/><br/>And if that&rsquo;s not enough, this upstart named Hitler is mobilizing his forces, and he looks to be a rough customer. His rhetoric is certainly more than mere sabre rattling. No doubt, he and his Nazis are mixed up in this mayhem somehow or other&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>Grounded in (Pulp) Logic<br/><br/>The traditional tropes, tricks, and genre conventions of pulp are given an intrinsic logic tied to the events of the invasion. These heroes are very much a part of the world, and are a direct result of Martian interference. Furthermore, the ripple effect cascades out beyond the initial alien contact and throughout the past thirty years since the first Red War, when their scout ships nearly decimated the earth. This background provides a milieu with enough flexibility wherein you can play as light as you like, or explore the seamy back alleys in a hard-boiled fashion.<br/><br/><br/>If You&rsquo;re the hero<br/><br/>You&rsquo;re guaranteed to make a fantastic guy or gal right outta the gate. This is high-powered pulp, and we aim to deliver on that promise. You can make any kind of hero you can think of, be it a masked vigilante, a mighty magician, or a scientist with his robot companion. The emphasis is on versatility, and eliminating rank requirements goes a long way to accomplish this goal. You might think it&rsquo;s crazy, and it is (crazy fun)!<br/><br/><br/>If You&rsquo;re the GM<br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve got you covered. In addition to lots of tips and tricks accumulated over a lifetime of gaming and nearly a decade of playing Savage Worlds, you&rsquo;ll be prepared for anything the players throw at you. Unfamiliar with pulp tropes? We&rsquo;ve got you covered as well by taking you through various genre conventions and explaining how to incorporate them into your game. The plot point campaign and side treks should keep your heroes busy for a long time, but if you couple them with our critically acclaimed adventure generators, you&rsquo;ll be having rollicking high adventure in no time.<br/><br/><br/>What&rsquo;s Revised?<br/><br/>As the oldest Savage Worlds licensee, we've learned a lot over the years and we've listened to our crack crew of editors and the feedback you provided us. Folks wanted more Martians in this book. The promise of the threat on the horizon wasn't enough. We've honed our focus in on that in a big, big way with the enclosed plot point campaign (which we&rsquo;ll get to in a moment). The edges have been expanded. We've included our tried and tested simple power system that doesn't rely on power points, our extended trait check system, and more. The focus is on versatility, with you able to build the hero you want to play. There&rsquo;s more, but we don&rsquo;t want to give everything away.<br/><br/><br/>The Plot Point Campaign<br/><br/>This is a massive twelve part campaign taking the heroes around the globe and even above it. In it, you will brave hidden temples and dank castles, confront Martian tripods and more, all in proper pulp fashion. Oh yeah, you&rsquo;ll likely trade bullets with gangsters and blows with Nazis.

It is the seventh total game in the Ace Attorney series (not counting cross-overs) and the fifth installment of the main lineage. It will be the first in the series to be released on the Nintendo 3DS. The game will see Phoenix Wright return as the main protagonist and will take place a year after Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney. The game is slated for released in Japan on July 25, 2013, and as a digital release in North America and Europe in Fall 2013.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game looks to continue the style of gameplay from previous installments, in which the player must utilize evidence and find contradictions in witness statements to prove their client innocent. Like previous games, gameplay is split up between Investigations, in which players find evidence and question witnesses, and Trials, where they must use the evidence to expose contradictions. Areas during Investigations are now presented in 3D, allowing players to change their view and zoom in on areas to find clues. A new system, called the Mood Matrix, gives the player the ability to gauge the emotions of a witness, such as tones of anger when mentioning certain topics. If the player notices a contradictory emotional response during testimony, they can point out the discrepancy and press the witness for more information. Another new feature is a backlog function, which allows players to review previous dialogue in case they missed anything. The title now features full 3D graphics and character models, allowing more dynamic camera angles during gameplay. The game will also feature downloadable costumes via DLC.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ace Attorney 5&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "142824": {"poll": [], "name": "Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Nintendo DS (Collector's Package) edition", "Japanese Nintendo DS (New Best Price! 2000) edition", "Japanese Nintendo DS edition"], "average": "7", "videogameseries": ["Ace Attorney", "Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth"], "videogametheme": ["Detective / Mystery"], "usersrated": "2", "videogamedeveloper": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Adventure", "Visual Novel"], "videogameplatform": ["Nintendo DS"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Capcom Co., Ltd."], "description": "&quot;Gyakuten Kenji 2 (\u9006\u8ee2\u691c\u4e8b2, lit.

There are currently no plans for Capcom to release the game outside Japan.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game features gameplay largely reminiscent of its predecessor, Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth, with the 'Investigation', 'Logic' and 'Confrontation' modes returning. A new element involves 'Chess Logic'. During conversations with certain characters, the player must find a weakness in the conversation within a limited amount of time. The player is given two choices of dialogue. At times one of these pieces will show a chess piece; the player, if they believe they have an advantage in the conversation over the other character, can select the chess piece option. If the player does not yet have the advantage, they will lose some of the time meter, and will have to continue asking other probing questions in order to further build up their advantage. However, if the player does have an advantage, as represented by the relative strength of the chess pieces shown, they will succeed in overthrowing the character's conversation and progress in the game.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Gyakuten Kenji 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "142825": {"poll": [], "name": "Contraption Maker", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Macintosh Downloadable edition", "Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3004756.png", "videogametheme": ["Comedy", "Physics"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Spotkin"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Macintosh", "Windows"], "average": "4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Spotkin"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3004756_t.png", "description": "&quot;The team that created the original Incredible Machine&reg; is bringing all of the Rube Goldberg craziness to the modern age.<br/><br/>Solve puzzles involving ridiculous chain reactions full of hamster motors, trampolines, alligators, cats, and so much more.

With Thralled, we seek to set foot in that unconventional realm of interactive art and deliver a fulfilling and heart-stirring story that can be played by everyone, gamers and non-gamers alike. Our team's goal is to create an experience that will  touch the player's heart. <br/> This project is currently a part of the Advanced Games class at USC, where many award-winning video games have been produced.

As a result, we have had to work harder to hold on to our voices amidst the chaos. The Voice in the Garden is a narrative-based game for the iPad using the player&rsquo;s voice as the main input. Players use their voice to help unfold and explore the spatial narrative of the game. The Voice in the Garden aims to provide an experience for players to recognize and regain the power of their voice in an effort to reduce their sense of isolation.<br/>Voice, in its nature, is potentially curative. This concept refers to a therapeutic method called Melodic Intonation Therapy, which is a process developed to help people with communication difficulties. This type of therapy introduces musical components, such as rhythm and melody, to help with the production of speech. In The Voice in the Garden, players are encouraged to participate with their voice used as individual musical components.<br/>The idea of using voice input in The Voice in the Garden aspires to do more than try to replicate the purpose of voice in the real world. The game experiments with looking for a distinctive purpose of voice in digital media. When players use their voice as a vehicle to empower a narrative, it becomes a process of self-construction through which players are able to bridge a deeper connection within themselves as well as with their greater surroundings.<br/>The game encourages players to reflect on themselves. The garden is a metaphor for a person&rsquo;s inner world. The dynamic narrative is about a person exploring a garden and trying to find the way to open the door. Using the first-person perspective, the players take an active role as they use their influence to nourish the garden and heal their inner world.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "142875": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1680705.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Caleb Grace", "Matthew Newman"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Cristi Balanescu", "Tiziano Baracchi", "Ryan Barger", "Christine Bian", "Sara Biddle", "Dimitri Bielak", "Sabin Boykinov", "Lane Brown", "Daarken", "Alexandre Dainche", "Mariusz Gandzel", "Marcia George-Bogdan", "Sebastian Giacobino", "Brent Hollowell", "Rafa\u0142 Hrynkiewicz", "Aleksander Karcz", "Drazenka Kimpel", "Julian Kok", "Adam Lane", "Diego Gisbert Llorens", "Melanie Maier", "Aaron Miller", "Sarah Morris", "Jake Murray", "Mike Nash", "David A.

The Inverse World is on the inside of a planet, and could even be inside of an already existing campaign world, if you dig deep enough.<br/><br/>The locals call it a different name, however: Invells. Invells is a mystical place, where an imprisoned god casts light and rain up to the top of the world, and then it all drains back down to the center. The great god Sola is trapped in the center of Invells, a massive burning star that created the light and rain from which all life in Invells was formed. Well, most life.<br/><br/>Invells is a bizarre world, filled with all manner of flying fish, strange monsters, wondrous machinery, and Sola&rsquo;s children, the three spirit-blessed races. Airships, great chains, and winged angels bridge the open gaps between the floating islands. Shanty towns of wood and iron cling to the top of the world. Great cities of light and gold are hidden within the sea of clouds surrounding Sola&rsquo;s cage, a molten sea of gold with a god trapped inside. There is much to see, and all of it is just out of reach.<br/><br/>Inverse World Accelerated is a supplement for the Fate Accelerated Edition tabletop roleplaying game, set in Invells, a wholly different sort of fantasy world. Inverse World is built around the idea of making fantasy fantastic again, by introducing a world unlike any other.<br/><br/>This book includes everything you need to play Fate Accelerated Edition - no other books required! It also includes information on the various types of explorers and people found in Invells, along with detailed and highly customizable character creation options. Inverse World Accelerated introduces the Inverting mechanic, allowing you to make the most out of bad rolls, and features a unique method of character advancement built around Discoveries - you improve by learning more about the world around you and adapting to what you've discovered.<br/><br/>This book also introduces the new setting of Invells, but it does so with an aura of mystery and a bit of strangeness &ndash; nothing about Invells is locked in place except what the players say about it.

The squadron&rsquo;s task was to destroy the dams that controlled the reservoirs feeding Germany&rsquo;s war engine. In the words of aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis, the mastermind behind the operation, &ldquo;power is dependant on the supply of natural stores of energy such as coal, oil and water.... If their destruction or paralysis can be accomplished THEY OFFER A MEANS OF RENDERING THE ENEMY UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF CONTINUING TO PROSECUTE THE WAR.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Lancasters had been modified to carry a most unusual ordnance codenamed Upkeep. It looked more like a petrol barrel than an explosive device, but the painstakingly engineered and tested outer layer cushioned a volatile mine designed by Wallis to bounce over torpedo nets and kiss the lip of the dam, its backspin carefully devised to hug the dam rather than ricochet on impact. Upkeep was supposed to plunge down along the wall like a depth-charge, detonating halfway down. The concussion would crack the structure, and the water&rsquo;s mass held back by the dam would push open the crack, creating a breach in the wall. The dam would be destroyed.<br/><br/>Eight of the Lancasters would not return that night, but the two primary targets of the M&ouml;hne and Eder dams were breached, letting loose a combined torrent that measured nearly half a million tons of water and taking the lives of over 1200 German civilians and military personnel. Measured in civilian casualties, it was the most lethal night of the bombing campaign thus far, although later missions would dwarf its casualty list. Measured in terms of industrial disruption, the raid cut the region&rsquo;s electrical power for several hours and severely reduced its water reservoir. It was not a decisive blow, but it was successful nonetheless. Had at least one other dam been breached, it could have been devastating. This is your challenge: can you match 617&rsquo;s success? Can you surpass it?<br/><br/>The Game <br/>In Enemy Coast Ahead: The Dambuster Raid, you command a newly formed squadron assigned the task of breaching the dams in the Ruhr Valley.  Not only are you presented with a variety of decisions, you play the invisible hand of fate as your crews endure the hazards of a dangerous night raid. Play the campaign and you get to organize and train the squadron, or play the historical scenarios.<br/><br/>Players <br/>Play solitaire and you do it all. Play with teammates and one of you is the squadron commander giving orders to subordinates. The squadron commander wins if the dams are breached, while subordinates compete to accomplish their orders with the least casualties to the men and machines assigned to them. Only one subordinate will win. Of course, if the dams are not breached, you all lose.<br/><br/>Scale &amp; Detail <br/>Each Lancaster is represented by its own 1&rdquo; counter. Each bomber will carry two or three 5/8&rdquo; markers representing aircrew, ordnance and possibly an elite crewman. All the men awarded decorations before or during the raid are represented in this game by their own marker, each imparting a unique characteristic to its crew.  Even the squadron commander&rsquo;s dog gets his own marker!<br/><br/>Ground crew are also featured in the campaign game, represented by markers rated for a variety of tasks. You will have to requisition and manage your Erks effectively while maintaining security. That&rsquo;s not so easy. You may find it necessary to transfer the local barmaid or take the drastic measure of transferring 54 squadron out of Scampton airbase, or even quarantining the base altogether.<br/><br/>Reconnaissance is crucial. In the campaign game you will need to survey the defenses of the dams and the routes to them, but too much recon and you risk tipping off the enemy.  But how much is too much? You will have to target the right dams or the right combination of dams, to get the job done. M&ouml;hne and Eder are the juiciest targets, but what if they are well defended? Do you risk it, or go for the other dams hoping to breach enough of them to achieve your goal?<br/><br/>Training is vital. In the campaign game you will requisition and then train your crew to fly at exceptionally low altitude, maintain a steady speed, locate the target in the dead of night, and release ordnance at precisely the right distance from the lip of the dam. You will only have just so much time to prepare your squadron. You might have to decide what is more important: learning to maintain the right altitude and speed while preparing to release ordnance, or the ability to find the dam? If your men don&rsquo;t master these skills quickly you may have to favor one over the other. You can always impose extra training, but push your men too hard and they become fatigued, perhaps even damaging their bomber in training or worse, crashing it. And if you don&rsquo;t push them enough you may run out of time. The moon will be right only for so long and the reservoirs are slowly rising. Once full, the Germans will open the valves and release the water, making them that much harder to breach. The clock is ticking.<br/><br/>The game board is organized into three sections, the Mission Planning Blotter, the Flight Map (from Scampton to the Ruhr), and the Target Maps. The first scenarios use only the Target Maps, while larger scenarios will use them as well as the Flight Map. Only the campaign game takes full advantage of the Planning Mission Blotter, allowing you to organize and train your squadron, assign tasks to ground crew, and modify the Lancasters for this unique raid.  The Lancasters were modified in a number of ways for Operation Chastise:<br/><br/><br/>     top-turret and armor were removed to compensate for the weight of the bouncing bomb (yes, those bombers were sitting ducks for Nightfighters).<br/>     VHF radio sets were installed to allow better command and control while over the target (they were standard in fighters but this was the first time a bomber&rsquo;s cockpit was fitted with them).<br/>    Dann bombsight. pair of Aldis spotlights rigged to judge the bomber&rsquo;s altitude over the reservoir.<br/><br/><br/>The Target Maps are intended to portray (and analyze) four key elements in a bomber&rsquo;s attack: altitude, speed, distance from the dam, and the angle of approach to the face of the dam&rsquo;s wall. During an attack you will strive for the perfect angle, the ideal speed and altitude, adjusting one or more of these before releasing Upkeep at just the right distance from the dam (&ldquo;Upkeep&rdquo; was the codename for the bouncing bomb). You may choose to pull-up rather than release ordnance, circling around for another run, because finding that sweet spot is tricky and each Lancaster has only one bomb to drop. You&rsquo;ve got to make it count.<br/><br/>Campaign Game<br/>The full campaign game begins with the forming of the squadron weeks before the raid. The player assumes the role of squadron leader or one of his subordinates in team play, requisitioning bombers, ground crew, and aircrew. He must train the aircrews and results are variable. Veterans tend to get more out of training than less experienced crews, but there is always the possibility of damaging and even crashing bombers, and losing or exhausting crews in training. As Air Vice Marshal Cochrane explained to 617&rsquo;s Wing Commander: &ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s a lot of urgency in this, because you haven&rsquo;t got long to train. Training will be the important thing, so get going right away.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the player may order recon missions along the flight path and over the dams, garnering information that will help him devise a target list. There are 7 dams that can be attacked, but it is unlikely the player will have the resources to hit them all (there&rsquo;s nothing stopping him from trying). Before launching the attack the player would like to know which dams are defended by flak, searchlights and balloons, and how high the reservoir is (the higher the better, but too high and the Germans may soon open the valves and reduce the water-level, so timing is crucial). Too much recon can tip off the Germans, however, which means that the fog of war is a very important aspect of the design.  The player won't know if security has been compromised until the flight is already underway. As Wing Commander Gibson explained to the men of 617 squadron: &ldquo;When the other boys ask you what you&rsquo;re doing, just tell them to mind their own business, because of all things in this game, security is the greatest factor.&rdquo;<br/><br/>All this planning and preparation ends when the player decides his squadron is ready and he launches the raid. The player then organizes his squadron into waves, assigning aircrew to Lancasters, arming them with ordnance, and assigning primary and secondary targets, and wave leaders. Once launched, bombers are likely to encounter hazards along the flight path -- flak and searchlights of course, but also utility poles and trees. Historically, 617 squadron flew low enough to hit sea waves and electrical cables (the player may choose to fly high, but that risks encountering nightfighters, an even more lethal threat). Along the route bombers might experience engine trouble or lose their way. Navigation training pays off during the flight turns (each turn represents one hour of historical time).<br/><br/>Upon reaching and acquiring the target, the player uses target maps to play attack turns, each representing approximately 8 minutes of historical time. Here each bomber has to negotiate the dam's immediate terrain and defenses (if any -- recon missions might have revealed that some dams are undefended, making them prime targets, but if security has been compromised the player may discover that the Germans have added defenses). There is an approach sequence where the player must resolve the attack of each bomber on the target map, striving for the perfect speed and altitude, hopefully releasing the bouncing mine at precisely the right distance from the dam. There is the possibility of being jumped by nightfighters if the attack is prolonged, motivating the player to get the job done promptly.<br/><br/>And finally, the player resolves the fate of returning bombers as well as those that lost their way, and then conducts a morning-after recon mission verifying the damage he inflicted on the dams.  A dam that was only damaged may have weakened and breached by morning, or conversely, the reports of your exuberant bomber crews may prove to have been exaggerated.<br/><br/>The Scenarios <br/>The game is also presented in nine scenarios, each isolating a particular aspect of Operation Chastise. In fact, the rules are organized in program-fashion, the first section explains the attack rules. The first few scenarios can thus be played after just reading those rules. The first scenario, for example, treats the action over the M&ouml;hne reservoir, while subsequent scenarios incorporate more of the mission (and more rules) until the player is ready to undertake the campaign game encompassing the entire operation from training to bombing and return.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.83057", "name": "Enemy Coast Ahead: The Dambuster Raid", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Simulation"], "age": "0", "usersrated": "193", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Solitaire Games", "Solitaire Wargames"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Low Player Count - Ep 20 - Our Top 5 Solo Games", "Low Player Count - Ep. 10 - The Digital Mail Bag"]}, "142890": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1666442.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Bryan Ansell", "Nigel Stillman"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1990", "maxplayers": "0", "boardgameartist": ["Tony Ackland", "Dave Andrews", "John Blanche", "Paul Bonner", "Paul Campbell", "Gary Chalk", "Mark Craven", "Wayne England", "David Gallagher", "Tony Hough", "Colin Howard", "Martin McKenna", "Mike McVey", "Adrian Smith", "Kevin Walker", "Richard Wright"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Games Workshop Ltd."], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1666442_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Book", "Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Science Fiction", "Wargame"], "description": "Waaargh the Orks is the first expansion covering the Ork race for Rogue Trader.

The series is known for a number of firsts, including some of the first examples of voice acting in the video game industry (WC2), the world's first fully interactive movie (WC3), one of the very first games that could be played over a network (WC: Armada), and one of the first &quot;episodic&quot; video games ever created (WC: Secret Ops).<br/><br/>The Wing Commander series is set in the 27th century and chronicles the struggles of the Terran Confederation, a starfaring human society, in their epic struggle and ultimate victory against the forces of the Kilrathi Empire, a cat-like species with a warrior-based culture. After a brief inter-human<br/>conflict later in the series, a new conflict heats up against a new, powerful foe known only as the Nephilim.<br/><br/>The book you're reading is a pencil-and-paper (PNP) role-playing game adaptation of these original games.

In the game, foragers pick fruit from trees, fish in lakes, and hunt aurochs in the fields. After collecting these foods, the foragers return to a fire pit, where they &quot;share&quot; their food with the tribe and earn victory points. In addition, the foragers sometimes happen upon tools, which allow them to forage, fish, or hunt more efficiently.  Of course, foragers are not completely altruistic and so they occasionally fight with each other to earn respect. The player who can best optimize their food and tool gathering, while also avoiding or winning skirmishes is the one who eventually earns the tribe leader title.<br/><br/>The game is played over a predetermined number of rounds, depending upon the number of players. In each round, all players simultaneously choose an action card, from a hand of 3 action cards (drawn from a deck of 10) to use for that round. Each action card lists 5 different actions, but a player may only use 4 of those actions each round. Then, in clockwise order, each player performs 1 of the actions on their card until all players have performed 4 actions. Such actions include things like: walking, foraging, eating, discovering, resting, sharing, and picking up a tool.<br/><br/>When players pick up food, they place it on their tableau, which tracks the food's freshness. At the end of each round, a &quot;spoilage card&quot; is flipped and all players &quot;age&quot; their food (i.e., move them along a food track).  As the food gets older, it does not provide as much energy if eaten.  Also, to score victory points, players must &quot;share&quot; their food before it spoils.

A heart attack? Poison? Murder? The copilot must now take the lead, but other crewmembers distrust him. The crew believes there are infiltrators amongst them. But who? A skirmish occurs. Will all infiltrators get exposed?<br/><br/>Each crewmember either belongs to the honest crew, or is among the few infiltrators who know one another. At the start you receive 3 identity cards, 2 or 1 honest and 1 or 2 infiltrator. The card you have double, determines your identity. You place these secret cards, mixed, face down in front of you. Then each player looks at 1 card per neighbor. By placing a knowledge tile at a card, you show (or perhaps lie about) what you see. You'll never see more than 1 of another player's 3 cards. So you must combine your own knowledge with the claims of others! But who can you trust?? In order to keep from being unmasked, the infiltrators will naturally act as if they're trying to deduce who might betray the crew.<br/><br/>During skirmishes, some crewmembers will receive first the &quot;Benefit of the Doubt&quot;, then they can graduate to a status of &quot;Reliable&quot;, and then one of these two reliable crewmembers will become the new Captain. This Captain must start to form a final crew that excludes the infiltrators from access to the cockpit.<br/><br/>With each skirmish, a player sees one identity card held by another player and shares this knowledge (but possibly lies). So each player knows cards self and must value the claims of others. With all players knowing different things, the deductive logic gets deeper and deeper as you theorize about who is who, while also holding possible lies in mind!

They abducted millions of humans. Not just humans, though. The Aeth arrived with a ship bigger than Earth and took entire chunks of the planet with them, setting them down like sod on the surface of their worldship. They never communicated with us, made no demands, they just did it, and then their worldship slowly accelerated back up to a fraction of lightspeed and with its tiny suns providing light, disappeared into the interstellar dark.<br/><br/>You are a descendant of those original involuntary colonists. Over the centuries, we have discovered that we are not alone. The Aeth remain silent and out of sight, living inside their worldship and only rarely venturing to the surface, but humanity has plenty of company on the surface. Some are friends and allies, some are enemies. Some we have not even met, for the worldship Aethos is a big place and humans only occupy a small part of it. We have recovered and adapted, remembering Old Earth in language and culture, but it is too far away for us to ever return. But more important is that Aethos has fired up its maneuvering drive. It is slowing down, a process that will take a century or more. The Aeth, for whatever reason motivates them, are approaching another star system. Allies who have been here far longer than us say that it is almost certain this system has intelligent life and habitable worlds, and that this is the most dangerous time to be alive. The Aeth will be out and about, hostile races will seek to take advantage of the chaos. Some may even try to escape and find a new home on whatever world or worlds are left when the Aeth get through with them.<br/><br/>Aethos is difficult to pin down as a particular genre. It is a hard SF setting with aliens and advanced tech, but it all takes place on one planet. It is about humans, but does not involve Earth. There is science and superstition, history and legends, open lies and hidden truths, redemption and destruction. It is 200 pages of space opera, exploration, political intrigue, espionage and military rpg setting rolled into one.<br/><br/>"}, "142928": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Corn\u00e9 van Moorsel"], "poll": [], "name": "Factory Fever", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Route/Network Building", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1703943_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Cwali"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1703943.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Multilingual first edition"], "maxplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Puzzle"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "40", "description": "Factory Fever plays in the warehouse of the Factory Fun factory. Instead of building the machines in your factory, now you must store the products in the warehouse, which is a very different task.

These products are both dangerous and extremely heavy, so for safety reasons you must not drag them more than once, and all products of one type must be together. Building conveyors helps to connect similar products.<br/><br/>You know which products will need to be stored, but you don't know when and in which combinations, so you must anticipate the future by holding different good options for stocking the goods.

If each of the six different goods is stored in a single group, you are doing well. For one product that task is easy because you have to store that type of product only once (i.e., 1 tile). The very dangerous product you should place at the wall, and for the mixed product you decide at the end which product type it is. The conveyors should not have dead ends (to the walls or pillar).

A number of exciting new projects that blur the line between the virtual and real will be announced in the run up to the game&rsquo;s launch. Not least of these is GT Academy, a collaboration with Nissan to unearth real racing driver talent that first ran in 2008. It was announced during the event that the competition returns for its biggest ever year in 2013, with the entry mechanic set to take place on an exclusive GT6 demo in July.<br/><br/>Other notable partnerships in the development of GT6 have been with tire manufacturer Yokohama Rubber and suspension company KW Automotive. Both companies are active in the commercial car industry and in racing, and they have acted as technical development partners for the game&rsquo;s new physics engine, for its tire and suspension kinematic modeling, creating an even more realistic experience for GT fans.<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "142956": {"poll": [], "name": "In Harm's Way - Tactical Naval Combat in the Pacific, 1943-1944", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Amiga edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1674300.jpg", "videogametheme": ["War - World War II"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Simulations Canada"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga"], "videogamehonor": ["1988 Charles S.

But in this dimension, moving ships will travel towards the nearest object, which is usually another ship, and when those objects are moving either forward or backward, reaching the warp gate isn't always easy. Time is running out to save your crew and your ship! As a grim reminder of the cost of failing to escape, the frozen hulks of dead spacecraft litter the escape route &ndash; but with careful cardplay, you can slingshot past these derelict craft and be the first to escape from the Gravwell!<br/><br/>This easy-to-learn game uses 26 alphabetized cards to determine movement order and thrust; most cards move your ship towards the nearest object, but a few move you away from it. Players will draft fuel cards in each round &ndash; picking up three pairs of two cards, with only the top card of each pile being visible &ndash; giving you some information as to which moves you can expect from the other spaceships. During a round, each player will play all of his fuel cards in the order of his choosing.

It puts players in the position of having to utilize the full spectrum of military operations, which also include weapons of mass destruction. The game is played in scenarios, each postulating different reasons for the war, as well as different levels of mobilization. You win by defeating the enemy and gaining national objectives.<br/><br/>The game emphasizes land and airpower. Naval warfare is factored out on the premise that the Chinese and Russian navies would cancel each other out for the period that the game scenarios covered.<br/><br/>Conventional land and airpower are treated in a generally similar manner. This is in part because of the lack of sophisticated higher level airpower doctrines in the Chinese and Russian armed forces, but also because of the range and lethality of modern munitions: firepower is going to be the same whether delivered by a multiple rocket launcher system, an attack helicopter, or a jet bomber. The real difference will come in with the application of Hyperwar capabilities. Hyperwar is inherent in certain unit types, and can be assigned to others via Hyperwar strikes.<br/><br/>"}, "142997": {"rpgdesigner": ["Todd Bogenrief", "Bill Bridges", "Vidar Edland", "Andrew C.
