The first player takes control of the traditional blue Superman, while the second player takes control of a red Superman with a grey cape. The title starts out in Metropolis before going to San Francisco, Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. Superman is able to punch, kick and fly. He can also use a projectile &quot;Sonic Blast&quot; attack when the player holds down then releases the punch button. There are also objects in the levels he can throw and/or break. Some of these objects release crystals that can restore Superman's energy, allow the player to throw one projectile attack without charging or defeat all the enemies on the screen. The first four levels have three-parts - a side-scrolling part, followed by a vertically scrolling flying part and a final side-scrolling shooter part where Superman uses heat vision instead of kicking and can destroy or dodge obstacles such as rocks. Each part has a boss at the end. The final level, the main boss' spaceship, adds a side-scrolling shooting section to the beginning and an extra final boss fight at the end.

Once that boss is beaten, the players automatically move on to the next stage. Enemies appear from both sides of the screen, and the players must defeat all of them to progress. If the players try to simply travel through the levels without fighting, the screen will stop scrolling until all current enemies have been defeated, before allowing the players to continue progress. Enemies may move outside the confines of the screen, but players may not. Unlike Final Fight, there are no weapons to pick up along the way, but players will only pick up items for points.<br/><br/>Riot Zone<br/><br/>While WestOne decided to create a modified version of Sega's Wonder Boy for Hudson Soft as Adventure Island for the NES, they also took Riot City, remade and ported it to the TurboGrafx-CD as Riot Zone (known in Japan as Crest of Wolf (\u30af\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8 \u30aa\u30d6 \u30a6\u30eb\u30d5 or \u72fc\u7684\u7d0b\u7ae0)).

Originally being exclusive to the Atari Jaguar, the game received critical praise for its 3D graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay.<br/><br/>Tempest 2000 modifies the gameplay of the original Tempest by adding bonus levels, collectible power-ups, more sophisticated enemy types, and wildly varying web (level) designs.<br/><br/>The game contains a total of 100 webs, with new frame colors and variations every 15 levels.<br/><br/>Ports:<br/><br/>Tempest 2000 was ported to PC's running DOS, Macintosh, Sega Saturn and PlayStation game consoles, the latter version with several changes to the design under the name of Tempest X3. Interplay released a Microsoft Windows version later.<br/><br/>The DOS version contains optional AdLib and Roland MT-32 versions of the music. The Windows version is rendered in higher resolution, and has some unique glitches, like registering bonus level scores incorrectly.<br/><br/>The Sega Saturn version, programmed by High Voltage Software, uses a limited amount of sound channels, causing thin sound. In this version, the third type of bonus level has been completely removed.<br/><br/>Tempest X3, the PlayStation version, was released on November 30, 1996, with updated graphics and sound. [Tempest X3 is actually a newer remake of Tempest, which included Tempest 2000 as an unlockable bonus game.]<br/><br/>Reception:<br/><br/>Tempest 2000, though initially dismissed by the creator of the Atari Jaguar], is generally regarded as one of the best video games for the system. Of particular critical acclaim was the game's intense techno music soundtrack.

To this end the player is equipped with a high-performance AGAV fighter aircraft, which are armed with lasers and television-guided missiles.<br/><br/>Starglider is packaged with a sci-fi novella by James Follett, describing the game's background story, in which the Ergons effortlessly blitz Novenia despite the planet possessing a previously impenetrable network of utterly deadly defense satellites. The Ergons defeat the system by disguising their battleships as a flock of intergalactic migratory birds, the Stargliders (of the title). The defense satellites had been programmed not to fire on these birds (which migrated between planets regularly) and hence did not recognize the Ergon battleships as enemies, allowing the Ergons to reach the surface unopposed.<br/><br/>You pilot the only existing example of a prototype fighter craft, initially armed only with lasers, as the TV-guided missiles require an enormous amount of energy to launch and control, which can only be gained by induction as your craft skims over areas with high-tension power conduits.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Starglider&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82574": {"videogame": ["Amiga Classics Trilogy"], "poll": [], "name": "Starglider 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["North American Macintosh edition", "US Amiga edition", "US Atari ST edition", "US DOS edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1100788.png", "videogameseries": ["Starglider"], "videogametheme": ["Space", "War - Future"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Argonaut Games"], "videogamegenre": ["Arcade", "Flight Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["Amiga", "Atari ST", "DOS", "Macintosh"], "videogamehonor": ["1989 Golden Joystick Best Graphics of the Year Nominee", "1989 Golden Joystick Best Soundtrack of the Year Nominee", "1989 Golden Joystick Game of the Year Nominee"], "average": "7", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["MicroProse", "Telecomsoft"], "videogamecompilation": ["Amiga Classics Trilogy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1100788_t.png", "description": "Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Starglider 2&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Starglider 2 was an early 3D space simulator/flight simulator video game released in 1988 by Argonaut Games and was the sequel to Starglider.<br/><br/>The goal of Starglider 2 is to destroy an enemy space station with a neutron bomb, and the majority of the gameplay consists of collecting parts for the bomb, or fulfilling other prerequisites (e.g. finding the nuclear professor capable of constructing the bomb, or trade goods for the bombs necessary to destroy the shield generators protecting the space station), while fighting off enemy spacecraft, and delivering collected items to depots inside planetary tunnel systems.

It was first released in 1981 and later ported to DOS, the Atari 8-bit family and the Commodore 64.<br/><br/>Description<br/><br/>Castle Wolfenstein is a stealth game set in World War II. The game's main objective is to traverse the levels of the castle to find the secret war plans and escape alive. Progressively higher military ranks are earned upon each successful escape with the war plans, and the game becomes correspondingly more difficult as each higher rank is achieved. There are 8 ranks, beginning with Private, culminating at the rank of Field Marshall.<br/><br/>The game is played from a top-down perspective, though the characters are seen upright like in a side-scroller. The player traverses the levels by sneaking past guards, impersonating Nazi soldiers and sometimes even killing opponents. Castle Wolfenstein can be controlled with a joystick, paddles, or a keyboard.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Upon starting the game, the player is equipped with a gun and bullets, which were taken from a dead cellmate. Once the player starts moving, he attracts the attention of the guards, who will try to shoot or apprehend him. He must either run from the guards, or kill them.<br/><br/>There are two styles of guards, the basic guards, and the SS Stormtroopers who wear bullet-proof vests marked with the SS insignia. The basic guards are not very intelligent, reacting only to the sounds of gunshots and grenades, or after seeing the player wandering around without a uniform, and will gladly walk their patrol paths into your raised gun and surrender to a search. Additionally, they are unable to leave the rooms they are stationed in. The SS guards are much smarter and, once alerted, tend to chase the player from room to room. They require a large number of bullets or a grenade to kill.<br/><br/>The player has two means of killing enemies. The first is to shoot the enemy, but this expends bullets, a scarce commodity, and risks raising the alarm if another guard is present. Alternatively, a grenade can be used, though this will also attract the attention of nearby guards. Once an enemy soldier is dispatched, his body can be searched for bullets, keys, grenades and bullet-proof vests. The player will only take as many bullets and grenades as he can carry from the body, leaving the remainder.<br/><br/>An alternative to the player shooting his way out of the castle is to find a uniform (either in a chest or from a dead guard), at which point the normal guards will think the player is one of them. However, the SS guards will usually expose the player as an impostor.<br/><br/>Guards do not always have to be killed. Pulling a gun on a guard usually will cause him to put his hands up, allowing him to be frisked for ammo, bullet-proof vests, grenades, and keys, depriving the guard of the full quantity of these he carries. Any in excess of the player's carrying capacity disappear from the game. The player can still choose to kill the guard at this point, but it is not strictly necessary.<br/><br/>Some rooms contain locked chests that can be picked and searched. Some are empty, but others contain useful items such as bullets, grenades, uniforms, bullet-proof vests and the war plans. Chests can also contain bratwurst, Liebfraumilch wine, Schnapps, Eva Braun's Diaries, cannonballs, and medals, though all are worthless in terms of gameplay. Edible items, when ingested, result in comments on their flavor. After drinking an alcoholic beverage, a message of &quot;Hic!&quot; is displayed on screen and the player's aim is temporarily thrown off balance, resulting in bullets and grenades missing their target.<br/><br/>There are a total of 60 discrete rooms in the castle, on five separate floors. Although the rooms are shuffled at the beginning of each game, the path through the castle always remains unchanged. Therefore, it is possible to fully map the castle, and then utilize the map during subsequent games.<br/><br/>Other than the outer walls of the room and the stairs, the entire room is destructible using grenades. This can be necessary in order to access a chest from another direction if a body has fallen in front of it: searching a body has precedence over opening a locked chest. Chests can also be destroyed with a grenade, but if the chest contains explosives (bullets, grenades, or cannonballs) it will explode and end the game. Chests can also be shot open, but attempting to do so also risks setting off any explosive contents.<br/><br/>Running straight into walls temporarily stuns the player, but vertical walls can be clipped slightly by the player's motion and not stun him. Also, some horizontal walls can be walked into from the side without effect. Fallen dead guards can also allow the player to walk through horizontal wall segments and chests, albeit not from directly below. Surviving guards and SS will not walk over bodies, so they can be used to block passage to areas of the room, trap guards in cul-de-sacs, as well as block entrance by the SS into rooms.<br/><br/>One of the main drawing points for fans was its unprecedented use of digitized voices. German words shouted by the guards, such as &quot;Halt!&quot; (stop!) and &quot;Kommen Sie!&quot; (come, you!) were frequent. Though hard to understand, the voices added to the game's atmosphere and made Castle Wolfenstein stand out from other games released at the time.<br/><br/>With an emphasis on trying to avoid detection for as long as possible, Castle Wolfenstein and its sequel are considered by gamers to be prototypical stealth-based games&mdash;the first in a genre that wouldn't gain popularity until the late 1990s. The game was favorably reviewed by Creative Computing, one of the leading computer magazines at the time.<br/><br/>The disks save the player's progress as they enter each room; because they are continually being used, the disks cannot be write protected. This allows players to cheat by opening the drive door before the game can write the death status to disk; one can simply reload the game as if he or she had just entered the room.<br/><br/>In the Apple II version, the player could hold down the spacebar while picking a locked chest resulting in a faster unlocking of the chest.<br/><br/>Author<br/><br/>Castle Wolfenstein was written by Silas Warner (1949-2004). He was one of the original employees of Muse. In addition to developing Castle Wolfenstein, he wrote the sound engine (called &quot;The Voice&quot;) and the game engine.<br/><br/>Original artwork for the box was created by John D. Benson.<br/><br/>Legacy<br/><br/>Muse followed Castle Wolfenstein with Beyond Castle Wolfenstein which is very similar in terms of game play and appearance. The objective of that game is to assassinate Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>Castle Wolfenstein inspired the game Wolfenstein 3D by id Software, which was released in 1992 and helped popularize the first-person shooter genre. Some fans of the original game now call it &quot;Wolfenstein 2D&quot; to differentiate it from id's game.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82581": {"poll": [], "name": "Beyond Castle Wolfenstein", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["US Apple II 5 1/4\" floppy disk", "US Commodore 64 5 1/4\" floppy disk", "US PC Booter 5 1/4\" floppy disk"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic876700.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Wolfenstein"], "videogametheme": ["War - World War II"], "usersrated": "4", "videogamedeveloper": ["Muse Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter", "Stealth"], "videogameplatform": ["Apple II", "Commodore 64", "PC Booter"], "average": "7.25", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Muse Software"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic876700_t.jpg", "description": "Beyond Castle Wolfenstein is a 1984 computer game by Muse Software. It is the sequel to the innovative and successful Castle Wolfenstein, a prototypical stealth game. Unlike the original game, Beyond Castle Wolfenstein was originally developed simultaneously for both the Apple II and the Commodore 64, but was quickly ported to DOS, Atari 8-bit.<br/><br/>Description<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, Beyond Castle Wolfenstein is a combination action and adventure game. It is set in World War II during Adolf Hitler's rule as Chancellor of Germany. The objective of the game is to traverse all the levels of the secret Berlin bunker where the F&uuml;hrer is holding secret meetings with his senior staff. The player must retrieve a bomb that the operatives have placed inside the bunker and place it outside the door of the room where Hitler is holding his meeting, a scenario bearing a passing resemblance to the July 20 Plot.<br/><br/>The game features a top-down view of each room on the level, though the characters are seen upright like in a side-scroller. The player tries to traverse the levels by sneaking by, impersonating and sometimes killing opponents. The game is controlled via a joystick, paddles, or the keyboard. The player successfully completes the game after planting the bomb and escaping the bunker before it explodes.<br/><br/>The game is similar to its predecessor, but features a number of game play updates. The guards now use a pass system, in which the player is periodically summoned by guards and asked to show the correct pass (which varies by floor), or offer a bribe. If an incorrect pass is shown or the bribe is rejected due to the lack of money (for a total of 2 times), the guard will attempt to activate a bunker-wide alarm or kill the player.<br/><br/>The bodies of dead guards can be dragged through the room to conceal them, block passages, or gain access to objects.<br/><br/>The highly explosive grenades of the previous game have been replaced with a dagger, which can be used to silently kill guards instead of attracting attention with gunfire.<br/><br/>Additionally, the audio system includes an increased vocabulary and greater variety of sound effects.<br/><br/>Upon successful completion of the game, the player is rewarded with a high resolution graphic of the bunker exploding in the background, with the player running away in the foreground.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Beyond Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82582": {"poll": [], "name": "Strip Poker: A Sizzling Game of Chance", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Atari 8-bit", "NA Commodore 64 5 1/4\" floppy disk (engl & french back cover)", "UK Commodore 64 Tape Cassette"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Adult / Mature", "Card / Casino Games"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Artworkx"], "videogamegenre": ["Classic Games"], "videogameplatform": ["Atari 8-bit family", "Commodore 64"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Artworkx"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>In this game, you can choose between two female opponents: Melissa or Suzi.<br/>You start with a sum of money and play 5-card poker.

The game is set to be released in November 2010 and is a direct-sequel to Assassin's Creed II (but is not Assassin's Creed III) with Ezio Auditore returning as the main protagonist.<br/><br/>It is the first game in the series to feature multiplayer mode.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood will keep its sandbox style gameplay in an open world of Rome. Like the previous installments, the gameplay's core mechanics are based on Parkour movements, crowd-blending stealth, assassinations and melee fighting system. However for the first time in the series, the game offers a multiplayer mode alongside 15 hours of singleplayer campaign.<br/><br/>Single-player<br/><br/>The player once again controls Ezio Auditore through the genetic memory of Desmond Miles using the Animus 2.0 (which is the game's memory interface). It's been confirmed there will be more modern day sequences featuring Desmond. As a Master Assassin, Ezio will have to reorganize his Brotherhood in Rome to fight against the Templars. Hence the new management system: the player can recruit new members by completing missions around the city, send them to assignments around Europe or call them for support during missions (if they are not already occupied). Tasking the novice Assassins is essential to make them gain experience, and the player will be able to customize their appearance, skills and weapon training by spending the skill points they've earned. Although Ezio is a Master Assassin in this episode, his progression is not over and he will also have to master new gadgets, such as Leonardo da Vinci's parachute, which can be used when jumping from tall buildings.<br/><br/>The player will have to rebuild Rome, fallen into ruins due to the corrupted ruling of the Templars over the Papal States and concentrating all the wealth in the Vatican. Just like the village of Monteriggioni in Assassin's Creed II, the player will be able to invest in the city to witness it's evolution and unlock rewards. The player will have to conquer and destroy Borgia's towers to free city zones from the family's influence.  Completing this unlocks new missions and opportunities. Rome is the biggest city ever created after the first two installments (Rome is three times bigger than Florence from Assassin's Creed II) and includes five varied districts: Vatican, Downtown, Tiber, Country and Antique. No other cities or locations other than Rome have currently been announced as explorable, although Monteriggioni will appear at the beginning of the game, and Florence has been seen in multiplayer screen-shots.<br/><br/>The combat system has been upgraded to be faster and more dynamic. Striking first and offensive actions will be more deadly in Brotherhood than previous games where counter-attacks were the most efficient. This made the player wait until the AI strikes which slowed down the pace of fighting. The AI in this game is thus more aggressive and enemies can attack simultaneously. To dispatch them, Ezio can use melee and ranged weapons at the same time as well, introducing the hidden pistol in combat. It has been shown that Ezio can throw axes toward his enemies. There are new enemy archetypes in addition to those seen in Assassin's Creed II such as horsemen, arquebusiers, papal guards and others.<br/><br/>Horses play a larger role in Brotherhood, not only used as a means of transport (inside the city for the first time) but as a component of acrobatic sequences and advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them. Brotherhood also introduced various types of horse-related assassinations, featuring horse-to-horse assassinations. There will be environmental objects like the flower pot in Assassin's Creed II to move faster inside the city, as well as new objects such as merchandise lifts to quickly climb up high buildings or structures.<br/><br/>Multiplayer<br/><br/>The multiplayer experience will be available on all platforms. The multiplayer beta will be exclusive for PlayStation 3 users and it's slated to begin on 4 October 2010. Two maps have been confirmed for the beta: Rome and Castel Gandolfo. The unique multiplayer mode was heralded by many at E3 2010 where it was showcased. It even received recognition from GameTrailers when they awarded it the Best Multiplayer Game of the show. The players are Templars in training at the Abstergo facility. They use the animi (plural for animus) seen at the beginning of Assassin's Creed II to access memories of Assassins and then to acquire their skills using the &quot;bleeding effect&quot;. There will be various game modes.<br/><br/>Game modes<br/><br/>In Wanted, up to eight players are dropped on a map of medium size where they must find and assassinate each other. However, the rule is not the one of a standard deathmatch but rather a cat-and-mouse game. Each player is given another player as a target. The goal is to find and kill a target without being seen or killed by the player's own predator. If the player breaks cover, the target will be warned and will run away, starting a chase sequence. Players earn points by completing each assassination in various styles. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>In Alliance, eight players are put in to teams of two and working in a co-op esque mode and work together to fulfill various contracts whilst being hunted by other teams.<br/><br/>Characters<br/><br/>Players will be able to choose one of the available characters: Courtesan, Hunter, Barber, Priest, Banker, Executioner, Doctor, Merchant, Blacksmith and Soldier. Two special characters will be also playable: Harlequin, available with a pre-order at GameStop, and Officer, available with a pre-order at Best Buy. Each character will have unique assassination moves and signature weapons.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>The game begins shortly after the events of Assassin's Creed II in the year 1499. Monteriggioni is besieged by the Borgia's forces led by Rodrigo's son, Cesare Borgia. During the battle, Ezio's uncle Mario is killed and the Apple of Eden is taken by Cesare. The game then jumps to the year 1503 where Ezio, now a Master Assassin, seeks revenge and heads to Rome.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>", "videogameseries": ["Assassin's Creed"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Ubisoft Montreal"], "videogamehonor": ["2010 Game Critics Best Action/Adventure Game of the Year Nominee", "2010 Game Critics Best Online Multiplayer of the Year Winner", "2010 Game Critics Game of the Year Nominee", "2010 Gamescom Best Console Game of the Year Nominee", "2010 Spike Best Action Adventure Game of the Year Winner", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Action Game of the Year Winner", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Art Direction of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Audio of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Gameplay of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Multiplayer Game of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Best Technical Direction of the Year Nominee", "2011 British Academy Game Awards Game of the Year Nominee", "2011 CVA Best Audio of the Year Winner", "2011 CVA Best Console Game of the Year Nominee", "2011 CVA Best Game Design of the Year Nominee", "2011 CVA Best Narration of the Year Nominee", "2011 CVA Best Technology of the Year Nominee", "2011 CVA Best Visual Arts of the Year Winner", "2011 CVA Game of the Year Nominee", "2011 D.I.C.E.

It centered around the quest of several heroes to find the Ora Stone for the former king of Oddesia. When the alien race that now rules the land invaded, the stone was hidden deep in the dungeons  of the land by the King to keep it safe. Now, however, the king wants the players to recover the stone, which can bring life, light, and happiness, and to kill the alien king, Natas: King Satan. The heroes progress through several different dungeons and fight fearsome bosses such as Bullbeast and Grimrose, and finally recover the Ora stone. Upon giving it to the king, however, the king reveals himself as Natas and steals the stone. Additionally, a guard named Judas also betrays the heroes, but is defeated by them. The adventurers then chase and confront Natas, killing him and taking back the Ora stone and ushering in a time of peace.<br/><br/>Players can play as a fighter, thief, warlock, witch, bishop, elf, bard, or knome. Special classes, like the Princess and Harmet, can also be unlocked as the game progresses. The classes vary primarily in their black and white potion abilities. For example, the Bishop's white potion heals nearby allies, whereas the Bard's black potion has the ability to change the music. The game supports up to five players simultaneously. All extra lives are shared between players. The game also features a password system that tracks the player's level, class, and four base stats (attack, strength, agility, and intelligence).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dungeon Explorer&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82622": {"videogame": ["Namco Museum 50th Anniversary", "Namco Museum Virtual Arcade"], "poll": [], "name": "Galaga '88", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade edition", "Japanese Game Gear edition", "Japanese PC Engine edition", "North American TurboGrafx-16 edition", "Wii Virtual Console edition (TG-16)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1061087.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Galaxian"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "Space"], "videogamegenre": ["Shoot 'em Up"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamefranchise": ["Galaxian"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "SEGA Game Gear", "TurboGrafx-16", "Wii"], "usersrated": "2", "average": "8.5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamecompilation": ["Namco Museum 50th Anniversary", "Namco Museum Virtual Arcade"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1061087_t.jpg", "description": "Galaga '88 (\u30ae\u30e3\u30e9\u30ac'88, Gyaraga Hachigatsu) is a 1987 fixed shooter arcade game by Namco.

You see the Pumpkinus Magnificatum at the top? Been there since I don't know when. We're mighty proud of that- the Pumpkintown monument, you might say. It descends slowly, ever-so-slowly as the calendar approaches October 31st. When the Pumpkinus Magnificatum touches the base of the pole, gateways open up and nightmare wagons are hitched up to go to the other place. Trick or Treat Day -- 10,000 ghosts- and all the residents of Pumpkin Town who can manage it make the trip- big-bag little-baggedly crossing to the other side. Its an evening's entertainment to be sure, but also it is the only thing that keeps this town going. You watch. You just wait and see.

The game strategy fully depends on player's skills.&quot;<br/><br/>My brief description of how the game is played and the goal:<br/><br/>During the game, players attempt to race their 14 pieces around the Backgammon board, counter-clockwise, blocking their opponent's pieces along the way by occupying a point (a single piece on a point cannot be captured in this variant, in fact, there is no capturing at all) or by building a &quot;wall&quot; (two stacked pieces on a point make a wall) that no piece, friendly or otherwise, can pass over.  Movement, in this game, is only from quadrant to quadrant, each quadrant consisting of 6 points (1 thru 6, 7 thru 12, 13 thru 18, 19 thru 24).  The second piece on the wall has special ability of jumping over any wall that might be in the way to land in the next quadrant (hense the name &quot;Grasshopper&quot;).  Walls can only be built by moving a piece from the previous quadrant that is exactly 6 points away to a point that has one piece on it.  Once the players get their pieces to the 4th quadrant, they must build walls on the quadrant.  These walls (two piece stacks) can be borne off the board as a unit for the players turn.  The winner is the first player to bear off two walls consecutively, but not necessarily in two consecutive turns.<br/><br/>"}, "82681": {"poll": [], "name": "Airport Madness 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable Edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Airport Madness"], "videogametheme": ["Flight"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Big Fat Simulations"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Big Fat Simulations"], "description": "o you have what it takes to be an air traffic controller at a busy international airport?<br/><br/>As an air traffic controller it is your job is to keep aircraft from colliding, while avoiding unnecessary delays.

It was universally panned as a &quot;disappointment&quot;, mostly blasted in sharp comparison to the Bushido Blade titles. Kengo is considered a spiritual successor to the Bushido Blade game series for the PlayStation.<br/><br/>While Kengo's graphics are sub-par for PlayStation 2, Kengo possesses some unique gameplay features. Although they evolved from Light Weight's previous Bushido Blade titles, their depth are the strongest factor of this title. Unlike most arcade-style fighters, Kengo is not a button masher. There is only one button for attack and success is achieved through patience, timing, and skill.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/> The single player game is divided into three sections. The first two are training and challenging other schools. Training is divided into multiple mini-games that focus on one aspect of gaming, timing or button combos for example. The training serves to increase the maximum value of various character statistics, but not augment their actual value. The simple nature of the training quickly becomes repetitive. Challenging the other schools consists of fighting four identical-looking students, one unique student, and the school's master. The battles use wooden swords but are consecutive and of increasing difficulty, you do not regain health between matches.<br/> After defeating each rival school, you earn your own place as the head of a school. Randomly, you will have access to the Imperial Tournament, which is the final goal of the game. The tournament is fought with steel swords and you start each match with full health. You can still challenge other schools and victory earns you their school's sword. Equipping different swords gives you a unique &quot;special move&quot;. At this point in the game you will be randomly challenged by either the master or unique student of other schools and cannot decline. Losing such random encounters strips your character of that school's sword.<br/><br/>There is no gameplay to speak of outside of battle or training. The interface is strictly menu based. Subtle features such as being able to &quot;break&quot; swords in training and having to wait for them to be repaired add to the game's realism.

The status of a wounded character is still displayed during battle.<br/><br/>Offense is composed of four &quot;stances&quot; and one special move. A special move may not always be available depending on what sword is equipped. A special move is executed by pressing triangle when the Ki bar is full. The Ki bar can be filled by pressing triangle or by fighting well. Each &quot;stance&quot; is selected with the shoulder buttons and is composed of three moves. The moves are always executed in sequence and can be augmented by character's proximity to one-another, the analog stick, or pressing another button during the combo. Outside of battle, the four stances can be re-designed by replacing one or all of the three moves with other moves earned throughout the game.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Kengo&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82696": {"poll": [], "name": "Soul of the Samurai", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["EU Playstation edition", "JP PlayStation edition", "NA PlayStation edition"], "average": "7.25", "videogametheme": ["Horror", "Ninjas", "Yakuza / Samurai"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Konami Computer Entertainment Sapporro"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure", "Beat 'em Up"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami"], "description": "&quot;Soul of the Samurai\u200b (\u65b0\u6642\u4ee3\u5287\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 \u7f85\u5239\u306e\u5263, Shin Jidaigeki Action Rasetsu no Ken, &quot;New Jidaigeki Action: Blade of the Rakshasa&quot;, known as Ronin Blade in Europe and Oceania), is a part survival horror part hack and slash action adventure game from Konami, released in 1999 for the PlayStation.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/><br/>From the start the player chooses to be either a young male ronin named Kotaro or a teenage girl ninja named Lin.

Command &amp; Conquer 4 utilizes class-based gameplay as well as some RPG elements.<br/><br/>There are two playable factions: the GDI and the Brotherhood of Nod. Each faction is split into three upgradeable classes: offence, defense and support, each with their own specialized focus. The classes consist mostly of their own unique units, with the only shared unit among classes being the engineer. The offence class is focused on tank-based, front-line combat, relying less on any kind of fortified emplacements or bases. The defence class is focused on infantry-based combat as well as utilization of rudimentary base defenses, and are also the only class to have access to superweapons. The support class is focused on air-combat and specialized vehicles to traverse the environment, and is also equipped with special support powers that are used to assist teammates. Command &amp; Conquer 4 contains two non-playable factions from previous games in the Tiberium Universe: The Scrin (C&amp;C3) and the Forgotten (Tiberian Sun), the latter of which returning as a minor part of the story as well as a neutral class on the map. Command &amp; Conquer 4 includes a total of about 90 units, including many new units and updated versions of previous Command &amp; Conquer units. The GDI utilizes walkers and powered armor infantry for its army whereas Nod primarily relies on cyborgs and treaded vehicles.<br/><br/>In Command and Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight, each faction features its own campaign with the story told and played out from their perspective, each resulting in an ultimate conclusion to the Kane saga. In addition to the two brief single player campaigns, Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight features a cooperative campaign mode, which will allow multi-class play and integrated player progression. The difficulty in co-op campaign mode varies depending on the player's level, and objectives will be shared.

Players choose from different types of buildings, including residential, commercial, and recreational. To add to the realism, several brand names (including Staples and Loews Theatres) can be built. The player must attract customers to raise funds by upgrading their buildings. This can include flowers, extra seating, signs, air conditioners, or water towers. Landmarks can be constructed by earning landmark bonds. Unfortunately, the player has no control over the positioning of streets, as in some other city-building games.

As is common in role-playing games, the player&rsquo;s character will level up by gaining experience points through completion of quests and defeating enemies. Much of the in-game world can be fully explored from the beginning, regardless of how much the player has progressed through the main story arc. Despite being non-linear, many areas of the land are populated by strong foes with higher levels than that of the player initially and as a result, players may want to explore them once their character has improved. While players will travel across much of the landscape on foot, they are soon given the option to ride on horseback and even later, a chance to man the helm of a boat to sail across the seas between islands. In addition players can also fast travel using magical teleportation fixtures found across the map.<br/><br/>Rather than having players choose a character&rsquo;s class and style of play, as they level up points are given to be spent on improving their four main stats; endurance (health and damage), strength (combat), accuracy (ranged), and willpower (magic) while also unlocking and improving various other skills and abilities such as forging items, special combat moves, sneaking, spells and others. Players can also mix skills instead of focusing on one type of character build.<br/><br/>Materials can be gathered throughout the game world, either found in the wild, purchased from vendors, looted from fallen enemies or recovered from unneeded equipment. Whilst some materials can be used in the forging/upgrading of weaponry and armor, others can be used in the creation of lethal devices such as traps or bombs. Many others however are ingredients for potions that can be brewed by the player themself.

It was released in North America for the Xbox and PS2 on November 11, 2003 and on the GameCube on December 16, 2003, and later in Europe on March 19, 2004, July 16, 2004 and March 11, 2005 for the Xbox, GameCube and PS2 respectably.<br/><br/>Set in a fantasy world, the story follows the tale of a civil war between goblin clans after their creator and master is killed. The gameplay is a combination of real-time strategy and light action where players gather resources and build up their horde of goblins while also being able to take direct control of certain units.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Goblin Commander is a hybrid genre with much of the gameplay revolving around real-time strategy while incorporating elements of action gameplay. Players take control of a number from five different goblin clans, each with their own unique units and designs with the objective of harvesting resources to build up their horde and warring with the opposing player clans. Through a top-down perspective user interference, each player begins with one clan shine for every goblin clan under their command and only one Hall of Titans, the former for recruiting and upgrading goblins and the latter for special &ldquo;titan&rdquo; units and turrets. The clan shrines are in a fixed location and if destroyed will have to be rebuilt. There are two kinds of resources to gather for purchases and upgrades: gold and souls. Gold is found throughout the map by locating treasure chests and destroying structures, both the terrain and foe&rsquo;s. Souls are harvested through either defeating enemy units or capturing souls wells. Additional structures are located elsewhere on the world map and must also be captured for use. These include the Observatory for a greater line of sight, revealing unexplored areas of the map and the Alchemist Shop for purchasing rune magic to be used for their own benefit or against other players.<br/><br/>There are five different goblin clans in total; Stonekrusher (grey), Hellfire (red), Stormbringer (blue), Plaguespitter (green) and Nighthorde (purple). Each clan focuses on either combat or ranged orientated goblins, for example the Stonekrusher can recruit light, medium and heavy combat goblins but only just light range. They also have special goblins with their own ability such as the Hellfire scout for line of sight and the Stonekrusher drummer for healing other goblins. Additional units include a clan&rsquo;s unique titan that is large beast that have a variety of high damaging attacks but only one can be control at a time, and turrets that can be built across the map to automatically fire upon foes. Every time a goblin is recruited, it joins up with its clan&rsquo;s horde that is controlled as one unit, for example a player with three clans would have three hordes. Hordes can also be ordered follow other hordes and titans. The light action part of the gameplay involves players taking direct control of a horde or titan in a third person view and attack other enemies directly.<br/><br/>The game supports two modes, a single-player campaign where the player partakes in a series of missions with set objectives, slowly throughout gaining the command of the various goblin clans, and a two-player skirmish mode where two players can battle one-another via split-screen choosing the map and clans in advance.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Goblin Commander: Unleash the Horde&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82760": {"poll": [], "name": "Tournament of Legends", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["NA Wii Edition"], "average": "3", "videogametheme": ["Mythology"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["High Voltage"], "videogamegenre": ["Fighting"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["SEGA Corporation"], "description": "&quot;Tournament of Legends (previously known as Gladiator A.D.) is a fighting video game developed by High Voltage Software for the Wii console.<br/><br/>Tournament of Legends has ten playable characters based on Graeco-Roman mythology.

The game's theme song is Glass Flower (\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u82b1, Garasu No Hana)  and was sung by Hanako Oku.<br/><br/>In addition the game will also include a separate game, Tales of Phantasia X (\u30c6\u30a4\u30eb\u30ba \u30aa\u30d6 \u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30a2X, Teiruzu obu Fantajia X), pronounced Tales of Phantasia Cross, which will be the fourth remake of the first game in the series Tales of Phantasia.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon X&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82771": {"poll": [], "name": "Pokemon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["eShop Wii U Downloadable edition", "US GBA edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2985485.png", "videogameseries": ["Pok\u00e9mon Pinball"], "videogametheme": ["Anime"], "videogamefranchise": ["Pok\u00e9mon"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Jupiter Corporation"], "videogamegenre": ["Pinball"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Advance", "Wii U"], "usersrated": "7", "average": "6.71429", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Nintendo Co., Ltd."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2985485_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A followup to the popular Pokemon Pinball (for GBC), Pokemon Pinball: Ruby and Sapphire brings back the great pinball gameplay of its predecessor, but introduces all new Pokemon from the Ruby and Sapphire generations.<br/><br/>"}, "82772": {"poll": [], "name": "Final Fantasy XIV", "videogamemode": ["Massively Multiplayer"], "videogameversion": ["English/European Windows edition", "Japanese Windows edition", "North American Playstation 3 edition", "North American Windows Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1216593.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Final Fantasy XIV"], "videogametheme": ["Fantasy"], "videogamegenre": ["MMO", "RPG"], "videogamecharacter": ["Knight", "Warrior"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Square Enix"], "videogamefranchise": ["Final Fantasy"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 3", "Windows"], "usersrated": "6", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Square Enix"], "vgcharacterversion": ["Paladin", "Warrior"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1216593_t.jpg", "description": "Final Fantasy XIV (\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fcXIV, Fainaru Fantaj\u012b F\u014dt\u012bn), also known as Final Fantasy XIV Online, is the fourteenth installment in the Final Fantasy series, due for release on September 30, 2010 for Microsoft Windows and March 2011 for PlayStation 3.  The game is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game and is developed and published by Square Enix. The game takes place in a land called Hydaelyn, mainly in a region named Eorzea, which will have a contemporaneously aesthetic blend of science fiction and classic fantasy elements. The game will be released in Japanese, English, French, and German.<br/><br/>The first stage of alpha testing began on March 11, 2010. This was announced at VanaFest 2010, an event to commemorate the eighth year of Final Fantasy XI. The second stage of alpha testing began on June 10, 2010. The PlayStation 3 release of Final Fantasy XIII contained a key for a chance to access a beta, to be held later in the year. Beta testing officially started on July 13th, 2010.<br/><br/>The &quot;Standard Edition&quot; PC version is due to be released on September 30, 2010, while the &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; is set for release a week earlier, on September 22, 2010. The PS3 version is dated for March 2011.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The battle and job systems will be different from the one previously used in Final Fantasy XI, which utilized experience points and level-based progression. Final Fantasy XIV is being designed to utilize a skill-based progression system similar to that of Final Fantasy II. Character races will resemble and allow players to create avatars similar to ones in Final Fantasy XI. Group play has been de-emphasized, and now solo and group play have been balanced. Weapon use will alter &quot;character development&quot;.<br/><br/>The North American official website was updated October 7, 2009 and explains about the Job System, also known as The Armoury System. By wielding different weapons and even crafting tools, players will be able to take on the role of their choosing such as Gladiator or Thaumaturge. In general, the different roles are divided into four disciplines: Disciples of War (masters of combat arms), Disciples of Magic, Disciples of the Land (gatherers of material resources and students of the natural order), and Disciples of the Hand (crafters who invest their creative ingenuity in synthesis and industry). The crafting system will be a part of the Armory System; when a player decides to wield a Blacksmith hammer, their appearance will change and they will become a blacksmith. The same goes for harvesting tools; a player will be able to equip them and their appearance will change. They will then take on the role of a resource gatherer.<br/><br/>Square Enix is looking for a way to allow users to transfer their game names to the new MMORPG. The developers say that, in addition to Final Fantasy XI, games that have also influenced Final Fantasy XIV include World of Warcraft, Age of Conan, Diablo and Warhammer Online; however, they have also stated that their most important influence is player feedback. Chocobos will also return, but in a different role than in Final Fantasy XI.<br/><br/>In a DVD included with the September 2009 edition of Famitsu magazine, Nobuaki Komoto announced that while Final Fantasy XIV will include XI's job system, it will return to focus on weapons and skills, and will not have experience points or a leveling system. This would have been the third time since Final Fantasy II that the series had seen this kind of change. However, as revealed by game-play footage during the first open Alpha tests, players will accumulate experience points towards a player &quot;Physical Level&quot; and skill points that will accumulate toward a particular disciplines &quot;Rank Level&quot;. The players physical level will affect attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), while attribute points accumulated with each Physical Level can be used to adjust character attributes such as strength, intelligence, dexterity and other similar basic stats. There are no specific job-levels though, as seen in FFXI. The setting will also be changed from that of XI; while still set in a &quot;high fantasy&quot; world, the setting will be more modern than that of its predecessor and will include higher technology. The game will also include races &quot;familiar&quot; to players of Final Fantasy XI, but with new names and &quot;other changes.&quot;<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Eorzea's nations used to be constantly at war with each other until fifteen years ago when the Garlean Empire, a mysterious nation from the east, razed the mightiest of the city-states, Ala Mhigo. The nations decided to band together if they were to repel the invaders, but the Empire never came, leaving a state of d&eacute;tente throughout the land. The resulting peace has led to a wide swath of soldiers and mercenaries suddenly without a job, and so they are now forming guilds and going by a new name: adventurers.<br/><br/>Soundtrack<br/><br/>The soundtrack has a mixture of the three genres, Rock, Ambient and Orchestral composed by Nobuo Uematsu, consisting of 82 tracks in total. Two Volumes of the entire soundtrack has been announced:<br/><br/>* Final Fantasy XIV/Field Tracks - which consisted of all the field and background themes, it will also include the prelude and the main theme 'Ansers' Sung by Susan Calloway.<br/> * Final Fantasy XIV/Battle Tracks - which contains all battle tracks and all combat themes, it will also include the Final Fantasy Theme Song (also known as 'Prologue').<br/><br/>Classes<br/><br/>The Classes will be divided up in to 4 &quot;Disciplines&quot;. The Crafting Professions such as Gardeners and Blacksmiths have been included as classes, and the character will change into that job if it has the specific item equipped (i.e. If the character equips a hammer, he or she will become a blacksmith).<br/><br/>Developement<br/><br/>Final Fantasy XIV, previously codenamed Rapture (\u30e9\u30d7\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc), was first mentioned in August 2005, when Square Enix announced they had begun working on a new MMORPG, but neither confirmed nor denied that it was a sequel to Final Fantasy XI, or that it was Final Fantasy-related. Hiromichi Tanaka, producer of the MMORPG Final Fantasy XI, stated in April 2006 that developers were working to make Rapture a worldwide release for the PlayStation 3 and Windows Vista, before announcing in February 2007 that the game was being developed for the Xbox 360 and for personal computers, and that it might be brought to the PlayStation 3 at some stage as well. Square Enix announced at GDC 2008 that the new MMO was being targeted at all aforementioned systems and hinted that Mac and Linux clients would not be out of the question.<br/><br/>On June 2, 2009, at the Sony E3 Conference, Final Fantasy XIV was officially announced for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows through a trailer mixing pre-rendered CGI and actual in-game sequences running from the Crystal Tools engine. The game will be produced by the same team working on Final Fantasy XI, including Hiromichi Tanaka, and will be directed by Nobuaki Komoto. Akihiko Yoshida is the art director, and Nobuo Uematsu is composing the music (marking his return to the game series since he departed Square Enix after Final Fantasy X). The game will have cross-platform servers between PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows, making all servers accessible from any country. The game will be beta tested for longer than the 4 months that Final Fantasy XI was. The PlayOnline system will not be used for the game, but a solution is in the works for those wishing to easily switch between FFXIV and FFXI.<br/><br/>An Xbox 360 version of Final Fantasy XIV was considered, being announced to be in talks with Microsoft to bring the game to the system. However, in an interview with Eurogamer, Tanaka stated that, &quot;The main reason why we couldn't go with Xbox 360 was the Xbox Live system. [Live is] different to the normal internet environment, so when we wanted to introduce this game in the same environment as Windows PC it had to be PS3, so that was our choice. Microsoft has a different point of view: they want to have a closed environment for Xbox Live. We're still talking to... We couldn't come to an agreement on Xbox Live.&quot; FFXI was only allowed by Square Enix onto Xbox Live as it only required a Silver Xbox Live membership, therefore was not considered closed as did not require any additional fees to play. Tanaka has recently reaffirmed that development on the Xbox 360 is considered &quot;on hold&quot; and that there are &quot;no plans&quot; to continue development unless the situation with Microsoft and Xbox Live changes.<br/><br/>The PlayStation 3 version of the game will be released later than the PC version, owing to the limitations on system memory, the adaptation to which Tanaka described as taking longer than originally expected.<br/><br/>Alpha/Beta<br/><br/>In April 2010, Final Fantasy XIV entered into its alpha testing stage, which involves players from different parts of the world logging on at different times and testing what the development team at Square Enix had created. Square Enix had said that about 10% of the game was playable during the alpha phase. The alpha test ended on Saturday, June 19, 2010, after 11 weeks; the beta testing is being conducted in phases for developers to adjust game-play and technical issues reported by testers. Phase 1 began on July 10, 2010, and phase 3 ended on August 25, 2010. Open beta was announced to start on August 31, 2010; however, it was postponed due to &quot;critical bugs&quot; that needed to be fixed. Square Enix later announced that Open beta would commence September 1, 2010 at 19:00 (PDT).<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Final fantasy xiv&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82773": {"poll": [], "name": "Droplitz", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone Edition", "Playstation 3 PSN Edition", "Windows Downloadable Edition", "Xbox 360 XBLA Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic807766.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Abstract"], "usersrated": "14", "videogamedeveloper": ["Blitz Games Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone", "PlayStation 3", "Windows", "Xbox 360"], "average": "5.53571", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Atlus Co.

It is intended to be suitable for refighting actual battles as well as for hypothetical scenarios, one-of, equal-strength competition style games, and free form campaigns in which the tabletop encounters arise from strategic decisions made by the players. It is worth pointing out here that although some purists regard the last three options as somehow inferior to the historical refight, they generally present players with more challenging situations and allow them more opportunity to exercise their tactical skills, without the benefit of hindsight. Such games can be just as faithful to the &quot;spirit&quot; of the period as a slavish reconstruction, and are often more fun. These rules are intended to give the players an enjoyable and fast moving experience, while at the same time reflecting - as far as is possible with what is essentially a form of entertainment - the conditions of the real conflict. A game involving several hundred figures a side can easily be complete in an evening. After a few attempts you will probably be able to remember most of the rules which you will need, and so will be able to keep things moving without constantly referring to the book.

It features the F-14 Tomcat and, as a commercial game, &quot;is one of the most complicated and realistic PC air combat simulators ever created.&quot; The game features exclusively the F-14B version of the aircraft, even in scenarios where it constitutes an anachronism, because the developers found that flying the original underpowered F-14A was very unforgiving and &quot;not much fun&quot; for a commercial flight simulator/<br/><br/>The game<br/><br/>One of the most realistic simulators of its time, Fleet Defender modelled detailed carrier operations including air traffic and take-off/landing under various conditions. Under the most realistic settings, the player had full control of not only the pilot, but the radar intercept officer (RIO) in the radar cockpit as well, having to manage the several available realistic radar modes (the game manual had a section dedicated to the AWG-9 radar itself, which was unusual at the time). In keeping with the real-life aircraft's role, emphasis was placed on using the AIM-54 Phoenix missile as a standoff weapon where possible, rather than engaging the more nimble Soviet fighters in close-quarters dogfighting - although dogfights were inevitable at some point. There was also the option to control your wingmen's formations and tactics.<br/><br/>Three campaign theatres were included in the original game; the Oceana training theatre (which was mostly open sea with a small land area on the edge of the map), the North Cape theatre (the northern half of the Scandinavian Peninsula), and the Mediterranean theatre (Italy, the Balkans, and part of North Africa).<br/><br/>Although striving to be as realistic as possible, the game was noted for a certain degree of artistic freedom - within the scope of a military sim. One of the available campaigns was a somewhat implausible scenario that recreated a conflict between a Soviet and an American Carrier Battle Group in the 1980s, designed to play like the historic battles of the Pacific War. One particular mission sent you out to investigate an unknown contact, which turned out to be a classic sci-fi flying saucer. It was also possible to encounter a lost formation of TBF Avengers in a Bermuda Triangle homage and, in the North Cape theatre, a dragon.<br/><br/>In 1995 Microprose released Fleet Defender Gold. This version was Windows 3.1 compatible, included two new campaign theatres and 6 new campaigns, a mission builder, and some multimedia features, as well as bug fixes.<br/><br/>Its distant cousin is Jane's F/A-18, which reuses a lot of work completed in Jane's F-15 by ex-Microprose employee Andy Hollis.<br/><br/>Fleet Defender was one of the last flight simulations produced exclusively for DOS and Windows 3.1. It was playable in Windows 95 and Windows 98, but only if the user exited Windows and played in DOS-mode.

Characters usually live interesting lives, and die in an impressive way. This isn't one of those games.

The characters are Shinigami, a combination of detective, mystic, troubleshooter, and hero. They're dead, as well. There isn't a &quot;game world&quot; per se. The game takes place in the modern world, although a darker version of it. A homicidal psychopath might decide to make your life interesting in unpleasant ways, or a demon might take offense because you've foiled a plot. This game tends to lend itself to mature themes.

For centuries, this underground complex became a battleground, as one group, then another tried to use it to invade each other's territory.<br/><br/>Several generations ago, a human magician known as the Gray One, cast a powerful spell that stopped the Orcs from advancing past a magical barrier. This invisible barrier ran along one wall of a corridor in the upper level.

The Valley Confederacy has opposed the intruders by setting up traps and guards on the Orc-side of the Tombs. Still, the humans continue to trespass.

Set to this background the players represent members of the royal family and try to locate good sites for new oil wells, find and deliver the different oil qualities and ship them to their base camps.<br/><br/>However, the oil field is so huge that the players have to memorize where which oil quality is to be found. Moreover, the competing players are likely to interefere with the player's intentions.<br/><br/>To win the game, it is mandatory to collect oil qualities of different kinds, always keeping an eye on the ever changing prices. Balancing this will help !<br/><br/><br/>From the Boardgame News annoucement.<br/><br/>As for the game play, Ghawar is a pick-up-and-deliver game with a roll-and-move mechanism on top of a memory element. On a 13x13 game board, 36 oil platforms are laid out in a 6x6 square with one empty space between each pair of platforms. Players seed these platforms with 36 coloured &quot;oil stones&quot; with nine cubes in each of four colors.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling two dice and placing one of their five oil wells on the unoccupied platform at this location in the grid; if a player rolls 2-5, for example, she can choose row 2, column 5 or the other way around. Once all the oil rigs are placed, the second half of the game begins.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either rolls a die to move the truck, train or both vehicles a number of spaces equal to the die roll or moves one of the oil rigs to an adjacent location, most likely covering an oil stone previously exposed.<br/><br/>If a player's truck starts or ends its movement by an oil rig and doesn't already have a load, the truck's owner can lift the oil rig and buy the oil stone underneath it, paying the rig's owner the current value of the oil.<br/><br/>You can't purchase oil stones that aren't covered as there must be a well in place to bring the oil to the surface. You must bring the oil to your side of the board to deliver it before you can pick up another oil stone with the truck.<br/><br/>When your train ends its movement by an empty platform the train picks up the platform so that you can carry it back to your camp. At the end of the game, players lose points based on their relative standings in the number of platforms collected.<br/><br/>The game ends once all the oil stones have been delivered. If any player has failed to collect at least one of each type of stone, that player loses the game. Players still in the game score points for each oil stone they possess, for having more of their favored type of oil than anyone else, for collecting barrels, and for having lots of money due to sales. If you have the fewest stones of a type, less money than anyone else, and fewer platforms than someone else, you'll lose points.

The objective is to solve several mysteries without accusing the wrong person or shooting too many unarmed villains.<br/><br/>Each level starts out with a case to solve, and some possible clues. The player drives Tracy's vehicle through the city, avoiding snipers and other cars, to various locations mentioned in the clues, where the action shifts to a side-scrolling adventure game. If the player goes to the right location, he will find, during the course of his side-scrolling fighting, a clue icon that provides additional clues for the case, or the player will be able to speak with a character from the comics who give clues. There is one car chase in each level. Once the player has collected enough clues, he can drive to the location where the perpetrator is and arrest him.<br/><br/>In the side-scrolling mode, Tracy can jump, duck, punch, shoot from his pistol or collect more powerful weapons (with limited ammo). These include full-auto Tommy Guns and tear gas, the latter of which eliminates all on-screen enemies. If the player shoots unarmed crooks, then some of life energy is lost. The game provides two ways to restore health. One, if the players is down to 1/2 a life point, he can visit one of the police stations and recover an additional half-point. The second requires a &quot;first-aid&quot;, an icon found in some levels that looks like a heart,and is used by pressing B and Select at the same time.

Its gameplay is based on the 1988 movie Die Hard. During the game, the player rescues hostages and battles with terrorists from a top view perspective at Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building, and John McClane's task is to clear each floor of terrorists, and he can then use the stairwell or the express elevator to travel upwards, to a maximum of floors 31-35 (more floors are unlocked in &quot;Advanced&quot; mode). In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost.<br/><br/>The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans, and any of the 40 terrorists left alive.<br/><br/>One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the &quot;foot meter&quot;. The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits.<br/><br/>The game features cinematic sequences, which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left, and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.<br/><br/>Version Differences<br/><br/>The Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game is played from a top-down perspective, as opposed to the 1st-/3rd-person perspective seen on the Commodore.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Die Hard (video game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82881": {"poll": [], "name": "Disney's Beauty and the Beast", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["German SNES edition", "JPN Super Famicom edition", "UK SNES edition", "US SNES edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Cartoon"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Hudson Soft"], "videogamefranchise": ["Disney"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "usersrated": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Hudson Soft"], "description": "Disney's Beauty and the Beast is a Super NES action game that is based on the 1991 Walt Disney film.

Only a few people know the truth.<br/><br/>Each player takes on the role of a desperate mayor, managing a small seaside town in the midst of a blood-soaked crisis, fending off an unknown number of Great White sharks.<br/><br/>Jaws: Deep Red Sea is a fast-playing, non-authorised, non-profit, and non-collectable card game based on the films: Jaws, Jaws II, Jaws 3D, and Jaws: The Revenge. For 2-6 players, this game is a shark-filled, blood pumping experience, where all players draw from the same central deck. Each player manages their hand of cards - to defend their beaches with Fend off with High-pitched Screams, Brody's Service Revolver, Improvised Explosives, Rifle and Gas Cannister Ploy, Crushed Beer Cans, Kick feet desperately, while shrieking, The Orca, and Undersea Power Cable Trick, etc, as well as play scarily large Great White Sharks against their opponent's swimwear-clad vacationers.<br/><br/>Each player may also recruit grizzled experts from around the world to safeguard their beaches from closure. Such shark hunters include Quint, Matt Hooper, Philip FitzRoyce, Hoagie Newcombe, and Chief Brody.<br/><br/>The mayors can also utilise, to save themselves from monstrous fish, some of the following example cards: &quot;Sh-sh-sh-shaaaRRRRKKKKK!&quot; and Eat Screaming Woman - Brandishing a Flare gun while soaked in petrol and Moonlit feed, and the strutting Adonis, Shelby Overman, and Eat Powerboat Water-skier, and &quot;That's some bad hat, Harry,&quot; and Eat Diving School and &quot;Overman was killed inside the park. The baby was caught inside the park. Its mother is inside the park,&quot; and &quot;Love to prove that, wouldn't ya? Get your name into the National Geographic,&quot; and Consume Rescue Helicopter and Pilot, and &quot;You tell Shelby Overman for me he can take a flyin' leap in a rollin' doughnut on a gravel driveway, you hear?&quot; and &quot;Don't be silly. That would indicate a shark of some 35 feet in length,&quot; and Bite off leg, and &quot;Lens my ass!&quot; and &quot;Karateing the Picket Fences,&quot; and &quot;I don't believe it! Two barrels, and he's going down again!&quot; and &quot;Bad fish. Not like going down the pond chasin' bluegills and tommycods. This shark, swallow you whole,&quot; and The Indianapolis Yarn, and &quot;This was no boat accident!&quot; and &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat,&quot; and lastly &quot;What d'ya have there - a portable shower or a monkey cage?&quot;<br/><br/>Money is spent in the game buying Shark Hunters and equipment. Players can also, at any time, spend cash to alter Shark Attack dice rolls, setting the situations up whereby opponents' bathers may be devoured by monstrous Great Whites. Also, some cards, like &quot;Beach Closed,&quot; cost the target mayor cash, from revenues lost, forcing them to buy less Anti-shark gear. Money is generally in short supply. Steal or swindle it from other mayors if you can.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 10 vacationers and $10,000.<br/><br/>Last mayor with his beach still full of bathers wins.<br/><br/>NOTE: There is no player elimination. When a mayor has run out of holidaymakers, all his cards and poker chips are removed, and then he can only play Shark Attack cards on the players remaining - attacking the mayor with the most vacationers left in play (he's got the most bathers in the sea). If there is a tie, the player playing the Shark Attack card decides who to devour.<br/><br/>"}, "82904": {"poll": [], "name": "Baseball Superstars 2010", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["iPhone edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic810011.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Baseball Superstars"], "videogametheme": ["Sports - Baseball"], "videogamefranchise": ["Superstars"], "videogamedeveloper": ["Gamevil"], "videogamegenre": ["Management", "Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["iPhone"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Gamevil"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic810011_t.jpg", "description": "Baseball Superstars series is not just a small partial baseball but has all full features with even more in this year's edition.

Multiplayer is supported via Internet play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     An emphasis on playability allows a complete game to be played in under three hours. That's right, from Pearl to Nagasaki in three hours.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The theater of operation ranges from Singapore in the east to San Francisco in the west and the Aleutians in the north and Brisbane in the south. Point-to-point based movement. One month turns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Twenty nine bases of strategic and historical importance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Eye-catching digital counters of individual historical ships of light cruiser or larger size, amphibious transport groups, convoys and air groups representing the forces of the Imperial Japanese Navy, United States Navy, Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy, and Royal Netherlands Navy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Three scenarios. One purely historical, two with alternate set ups.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Two victory conditions for each side: one a &quot;quick&quot; win while the other a slower win. As the Japanese isolate Australia or survive until the American public loses its taste for war. As the Allies strangle Japan's oil supply or force them to the surrender table through a massive bombing campaign.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Scenario files are XML text files that can be edited, which also allows the OOB and ship capabilities to also be modified. Likewise, base information, sea distances, and relevance to victory conditions can also be changed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Turns consist of forming and disbanding task forces and assigning them to either patrol, raid, or invade. Patrol defends friendly bases, raids assault enemy bases and their defending forces while invasions attempt to capture and control enemy bases. Additional turn elements include designating ships for repair, supply efforts, and land based air location.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Combat is fast paced and uses a virtual 'Battle Board' with players choosing to engage their foe in gunnery duels or over the horizon with the use of air power. Air strikes must face CAP and flak, while in surface battles the Long Lance torpedo can be an Allied vessel's worst nightmare. Invasions involve transport groups attempting to overwhelm a base's defenders, softening up targets with pre-landing aerial and surface bombardments.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Plenty of tough choices!

In the game, players play as the bounty hunter Jango Fett, featured in the 2002 film Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. In the game, Temuera Morrison reprises his role as Jango Fett from the film.<br/><br/>The main objective of Star Wars: Bounty Hunter is to hunt Dark Jedi Komari Vosa. During the game, the explanation as to why Jango Fett is chosen as the template for the Grand Army of the Republic is revealed, as well as how Boba Fett, his cloned &quot;son&quot; is born. Players also fight many &quot;bosses&quot;, such as Montross and Longo &quot;Two-Guns&quot;. There are also side objectives, such as collecting secondary bounties, that open special bonus items in the game. When the player beats a chapter, blooper reels - comedic machinima productions - are unlocked.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>    <br/>The game takes place shortly after the events of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. Jango Fett is hunting a criminal, Meeko Ghintee, for his friend Rozatta, the Toydarian owner of Outland Station. After the capture, Jango receives a transmission from Darth Tyranus inviting him to participate in &quot;a special hunt... for a special prey.&quot; The reward is five million credits for the capture of the deranged leader of the Bando Gora, Komari Vosa. Jango reluctantly agrees to the hunt after Roz convinces him that with the reward money and fame the bounty would bring he wouldn't have to take random low-paying jobs anymore, and would make a name for himself.<br/><br/>There are rumors that the Bando Gora are behind some strange narcotics shipments (referred to as 'death sticks'), and Jango decides to pursue a low-life death stick dealer named Jervis Gloom, wanted by the Coruscant police. Jango captures Gloom in the Entertainment District, and coerces him to reveal his sources. This leads Jango to a nerf processing plant in the Industrial Sector, run by a gangster named Groff Haugg. When Jango arrives, however, he encounters Montross, who has already tortured and killed Haugg, and learns that the both of them are pursuing the same prey. Jango fights Montross, who flees, before finding a message on Haugg's computer terminal from the gangster's co-conspirator, the corrupt Senator Trell. Jango then fights his way through Trell's heavily-guarded apartment tower to the Senator's penthouse, and learns from Trell that the death sticks came from a Malastare crime lord named Sebolto, before he throws the crooked politician off a balcony to his demise, ensuing a battle with one of Coruscant's police gunships.<br/><br/>After Roz's advice, Jango proceeds to the asteroid prison Oovo IV to break out Bendix Fust, with the idea of delivering him to Malastarian drug lord King Sebolto, to gain an audience. Deep in the prison, Jango is surprised when another bounty hunter, Zam Wesell, reaches Fust before him. The two meet at gunpoint, but are forced to work together to escape the lockdowned prison. Jango's ship, Jaster's Legacy (Jaster being a commander of Jango's regiment and father figure in the Mandalorians), is destroyed; he then proceeds to commandeer a Firespray class police ship, naming it Slave I.<br/><br/>Fett and Wesell travel to Malastare to deliver Fust to Sebolto. Wesell delivers Fust while Jango goes in the &quot;back way&quot;, trekking through the dense jungle. Wesell escapes from Sebolto, and heads down the compound to where she has to call a Skiff hover vehicle for Jango to cross the Chasm separating the Compound from the Jungle. They then go back up the compound to Sebolto's Palace, and the drug king escapes down a pipe. In the next level, Sebolto is seen sliding down the pipe and down into a Death Stick Factory, crashing into a wall and falling down a chasm, at which Fett murmurs, &quot;It'll be a sour batch...&quot;<br/><br/>He ventures through the factory, and eventually comes to a cave crawling with members of the Bando Gora. Once he gets past them, he reaches a supply ship. On further inspection, he finds Huttese markings on it. Then Montross comes with a Skiff hovership, and the two of them battle again, ending in a draw. Wesell brings the ship and the two of them escape.<br/><br/>Not knowing which Hutt is involved with the Bando Gora, the pair split up to question the two Hutts, Jabba and Gardulla. Finding Jabba clean, Fett proceeds to Gardulla's palace, and finds Wesell captured in a holding cell. Fett tries to leave her there to avoid sounding an alarm, but Wesell compromises his position, and Fett is apprehended. After escaping detainment (and discovering that Wesell is a changeling and had lied to Fett), Fett reaches Gardulla, who refuses to give up Vosa's location. Fett then feeds Gardulla to her own Krayt dragon (to which Gardulla had previously ordered Fett to be devoured by upon detainment), before finishing the Krayt dragon off himself. Out of anger for her betrayal, he leaves Wesell on Tatooine to continue searching for Vosa.<br/><br/>Fett contacts Rozatta, who had helped him throughout his journey, and tells her the system, but Montross had been listening in and attacks Rozatta, rigging her space station to explode. Montross then taunts Fett, telling him that his friend is in danger. Enraged, he temporarily abandons his mission to help Rozatta. She is fatally wounded, and gives Fett a guidance device to help him track Vosa, who Rozatta managed to locate on Bogden, a small moon of Kohlma. Her dying words are for Fett to pass on his legacy, and not to live for nothing. She then dies, and Fett escapes just before the station explodes and vows to make Montross pay for Roz's death.<br/><br/>Fett arrives on Kohlma, a moon of Bogden and the hideout of the Bando Gora. After fighting his way across the planet's surface, Fett arrives at Vosa's castle, where he finds Montross is already waiting for him, and they duel a final time. Jango finally defeats Montross, who wishes to have a warrior's death, but Jango (as a means of revenge) lets the Bando Gora tear Montross to pieces as he walks away. Jango is finally able to proceed to Komari Vosa's lair. He enters the outer rooms, but is soon overwhelmed and taken prisoner by Bando Gora slaves. He is tortured, both physically and mentally, by Komari Vosa. Zam Wesell appears, and frees him from the restraints before being injured. Fett grabs his blasters, and drives Vosa out of the room. After tending to Wesell, Fett follows Vosa through the castle and fatally wounds her. As she dies on the ground, Darth Tyranus steps from the shadows and greets Fett. Tyranus explains that the entire ordeal was a test, of which Fett had proven to be the best. He offers Fett a considerably larger sum to go to Kamino, to be the template for a clone army. Fett agrees, on the condition that he gets the first unaltered clone for himself (passing on his legacy), whom is later known as Boba Fett. The game ends with Fett carrying the wounded Wesell to Slave I.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Star Wars: Bounty Hunter&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82918": {"videogame": ["Namco Museum Battle Collection", "Namco Museum DS", "Namco Museum Virtual Arcade"], "poll": [], "name": "Dig Dug II", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Arcade edition", "JP Famicom edition", "NA NES edition", "Wii U eShop Downloadable edition", "Wii Virtual Console"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1551855.png", "videogametheme": ["Mining"], "usersrated": "9", "videogamedeveloper": ["Namco Ltd."], "videogamegenre": ["Maze", "Puzzle"], "videogameplatform": ["Arcade", "NES", "Wii", "Wii U"], "average": "5.73667", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Namco Bandai Games Inc.", "Namco Ltd."], "videogamecompilation": ["Namco Museum Battle Collection", "Namco Museum DS", "Namco Museum Virtual Arcade"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1551855_t.png", "description": "Dig Dug II is the arcade sequel to Dig Dug, released by Namco in 1985.

The goal is simple: to kill all the enemies on the level. There are two types: Pookas, the round orange monsters with goggles, can only touch the protagonist to kill him, but Fygars, the dragons, can breathe fire to burn the protagonist, as well as by touching.<br/><br/>In this game, Taizo Hori (the player's character) is armed with two weapons. One is the pump from the original Dig Dug, which is used to inflate enemies until they burst. The other is a jackhammer, which can be used at dark spots on the map to create faults in the ground. If both ends of a system of faults reach the water, the ground surrounded by them will sink into the ocean, killing all creatures on it, including Taizo himself. The points earned from this depend on how many enemies are killed at once. After level 31, the levels have the same layout as the one 16 levels before it.<br/><br/>When only one, two, or on harder levels-three enemies remains on the map, it will eventually go to the edge of the island and jump off, killing itself and denying you points.<br/><br/>Dig Dug II was less popular than its predecessor, and the Famicom version was brought to the U.S. by Bandai.<br/><br/>The Namco Museum DS version has a stage select, for levels 1-15.

In most of Asia, including Japan (where it was first launched in 1983), China, Vietnam, Singapore, Middle East and Hong Kong, it was released as the Family Computer (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf, Famir\u012b Konpy\u016bta?), commonly abbreviated as the Famicom (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3) or FC for short. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\ud604\ub300 \ucef4\ubcf4\uc774) and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. In Russia, an unlicensed clone was manufactured called Dendy (\u0414\u0435\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0438). Similarly in India, clones were popular by the names of Little Master and Wiz Kid, in Poland there also was a clone produced, called Pegasus. It was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.<br/><br/>As the best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983, and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from game design to controller layout. In addition, with the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of software licensing for third-party developers.<br/><br/>Pin info<br/><br/>60-pin vs. 72-pin cartridges The original Famicom and the re-released AV Family Computer both utilized a 60-pin cartridge design, which resulted in smaller cartridges than the NES, which utilized a 72-pin design. Four pins were used for the 10NES lockout chip. Ten pins were added that connected a cartridge directly to the expansion port on the bottom of the unit. Finally, two pins that allowed cartridges to provide their own sound expansion chips were removed. Some early games released in North America were simply Famicom cartridges attached to an adapter (such as the T89 Cartridge Converter) to allow them to fit inside the NES hardware. Nintendo did this to reduce costs and inventory by using the same cartridge boards in North America and Japan. The cartridge dimensions of the original Famicom measured in at 5.3x3 inches, compared with 4.1x5.5 in. for its North American redesign.<br/><br/>Lockout<br/><br/>Lockout circuitry The Famicom contained no lockout hardware and, as a result, unlicensed cartridges (both legitimate and bootleg) were extremely common throughout Japan and the Far East. The original NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) contained the 10NES lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip&rsquo;s mode of operation from &quot;lock&quot; to &quot;key&quot;, removing all effects and greatly improving the console&rsquo;s ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports.<br/><br/>AV Output<br/><br/>Audio/video output The original Famicom featured an RF modulator plug for audio/video output, while its redesign, the AV Famicom, featured only RCA composite output. On the other hand, the original NES featured both an RF modulator and RCA composite output cables, but the top-loading NES 2 featured only RF modulator output. The original North American NES was the first and one of the only game consoles to feature direct composite video output, and thus having the ability to be connected to a composite monitor.<br/><br/>Design Flaws<br/><br/>When Nintendo released the NES in the United States, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The ZIF connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge&rsquo;s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Repeated insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out relatively quickly and the ZIF design proved far more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. Exacerbating the problem was Nintendo&rsquo;s choice of materials; the slot connector that the cartridge was actually inserted into was highly prone to corrosion.<br/><br/>Problems with the 10NES lockout chip frequently resulted in the console's most infamous problem: the blinking red power light, in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly because the 10NES would reset the console once per second. The lockout chip required constant communication with the chip in the game to work. Dirty, aging and bent connectors would often disrupt the communication, resulting in the blink effect. Alternatively, the console would turn on but only show a solid white, gray, or green screen. Users attempted to solve this problem by blowing air onto the cartridge connectors, licking the edge connector, slapping the side of the system after inserting a cartridge, shifting the cartridge from side to side after insertion, pushing the ZIF up and down repeatedly, holding the ZIF down lower than it should have been and/or cleaning the connectors with alcohol which, observing the back of the cartridge, was not endorsed by Nintendo. Many of the most frequent attempts to fix this problem instead ran the risk of damaging the cartridge and/or system. In 1989, Nintendo released an official NES Cleaning Kit to help users clean malfunctioning cartridges and consoles.<br/><br/>With the release of the top-loading NES-101 (NES 2) toward the end of the NES's lifespan, Nintendo resolved the problems by switching to a standard card edge connector and eliminating the lockout chip. All of the Famicom systems used standard card edge connectors, as did Nintendo&rsquo;s subsequent game consoles, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Nintendo 64.<br/><br/>In response to these hardware flaws, &quot;Nintendo Authorized Repair Centers&quot; sprang up across the United States. According to Nintendo, the authorization program was designed to ensure that the machines were properly repaired. Nintendo would ship the necessary replacement parts only to shops that had enrolled in the authorization program. In practice, the authorization process consisted of nothing more than paying a fee to Nintendo for the privilege. In a recent trend, many sites have sprung up to offer Nintendo repair parts, guides and services, that replace those formerly offered by the authorized repair centers.<br/><br/>Legacy<br/><br/>The NES changed the video game market permanently and was the longest-lasting console in Japan, lasting 20 years from July 1983 before being discontinued in September 2003. When the NES was released, stores mostly refused to sell products that went by the name of &quot;video games&quot;, due to the video game crash of 1983. Five years later, in 1988, video gaming was a multi-billion dollar industry. This change cemented Nintendo's rise from a playing card company to an internationally known company and set the stage for Japanese dominance of the video game industry. It also changed the way the video game industry worked. The NES marked the first time a console maker actively courted third-party game makers and created licensing for them to make games, as well as the first time a company tried to prevent unlicensed games.<br/><br/>In terms of hardware, the NES also had a large impact. The NES's controller was a change from those of older consoles, and was considered by many to be an improvement. This has meant that many later controllers have been influenced by it. In particular, the D-pad refinements used in the NES controller would be incorporated in nearly every major console to follow, and garnered Nintendo a Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award).<br/><br/>Culturally, the NES was the origin for many prominent games, and has become a part of gamer culture itself. Some of the more important franchises that debuted on the NES were Nintendo's own Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda and Metroid, Capcom's Mega Man franchise, Konami's Castlevania franchise, Square Soft's Final Fantasy and Enix's Dragon Quest (now Square Enix's) franchises. All of these still exist today. The NES itself, especially its controller, has become a popular motif for a variety of products, including Nintendo's own Game Boy Advance.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Nintendo Entertainment System&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82938": {"poll": [], "name": "Armored Core 3", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["German PlayStation 2 Edition", "JP PlayStation 2 Edition", "JP PSP Edition", "US PlayStation 2 Edition", "US PSP Edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1186728.jpg", "videogameseries": ["Armored Core"], "videogametheme": ["Mech / Robot", "War - Future"], "usersrated": "7", "videogamedeveloper": ["From Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2", "PSP"], "average": "7.35714", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Agetec", "From Software", "Metro3D, Inc."], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1186728_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Armored Core 3 reboots the series and once again places humanity underground after a global nuclear war renders the surface uninhabitable.<br/><br/>The player is a mercenary Raven in control of an Armored Core, a towering, customizable mech.

Unlike older models, 2.4 GHz 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi and a TOSLINK S/PDIF optical audio connector are also built-in, allowing for digital audio and wireless networking without the need for external adapters. The Memory Unit slots found on previous consoles have been removed in favor of the USB flash drive solution added in a previous system software update (released on April 6, 2010) and the power and DVD drive eject 'buttons' are touch sensitive rather than the physical buttons found on previous models. The external hard disk drive connector has also been swapped for an internal bay for use with a proprietary hard drive; this is neither a standard drive or compatible with older models. Other notable hardware changes include the use of one larger fan compared to the previous Xbox 360 models (which used two smaller ones) and the design of the vents, which are similar to those used on the original Xbox. Unlike previous generations of the console which had names to distinguish different SKUs, the new models are to be marketed solely by the amount of included storage, in a similar fashion to current models of its main competitor the PlayStation 3. When the first new models began to ship, remaining stock of the Elite package dropped in price to US$249.99 or AU$349 and the Arcade dropped to US$149.99.<br/>Xbox 360 250 GB<br/><br/>The first Xbox 360 S SKU to be revealed includes a 250 GB hard drive and its casing features a glossy black finish. It was shipped to US retailers the same day it was announced (June 14, 2010) and went on sale later that week. It was released in Australia on July 1, 2010, in New Zealand on July 8, 2010 and in Europe on July 16, 2010. It retails at US$299.99, &pound;199.99, AU$449.00, NZ$499.00 or &euro;249.00, replacing the Xbox 360 Elite at that price point.<br/>Xbox 360 4 GB<br/><br/>A second SKU which includes 4 GB of internal flash storage and has matte black casing (much like the Xbox 360 Elite) was released on August 3, 2010 in the US and August 20, 2010 in the Europe. It replaced the Xbox 360 Arcade and is priced at US$199.99, &pound;149.99 or &euro;199.99. Although this model has on-board storage, Xbox Product Director Aaron Greenberg confirmed that it does have a drive bay which Microsoft has &quot;the opportunity to use in the future&quot;. On August 20, 2010, Microsoft announced a 250 GB stand-alone hard drive for use with Xbox 360 S models priced at US$129.99<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Xbox 360&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "82945": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic808361.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Corey Clark"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "10", "boardgamepublisher": ["(Web published)"], "maxplaytime": "40", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic808361_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "40", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "description": "Ki is an territory game in the spirit of Go.

He counted the brothers Baldir and Hirmod to his friends, whose father was Jorn Entloft.<br/><br/>Samund stood on the battlements of the mighty castle and felt the cold winds blow with increasing frequency. There was a feeling of anxiety in the air, winter was not the only thing approaching. He was not the only one who felt discomfort. Something was wrong, something was happening. It was rumored that the entire western countries were on fire, that war raged, and that the ravens had never found food in such an abundance before. The lands on the other side of Osterhavet (Eastern Sea) were brought down to their knees and had turned to Pater [a high priest/the &quot;pope&quot;] for help, he had responded to their plea.<br/><br/>Everywhere he went inside the walls of Trollmark he felt discomfort, and outside the walls you could always sense the stench of death and decay.<br/><br/>On the path that led into the castle he saw a man - or was it a boy - walk to the gate. From his command post high above he thought the man looked unusually pale, he was also wearing way too little clothing. The man wore a large sword on his back. It was quite obvious that he was a housecarl, yet it seemed as if he had not yet reached manhood.<br/><br/>&quot;Reveal your name and your business&quot;, Samund shouted from the battlements.<br/><br/>The man stopped and looked towards Samund.<br/><br/>&quot;I have come to serve, what you call me does not matter.&quot;<br/><br/>Little did Samund suspect that the man was carrying doom and nothing good would come of his visit to Trollmark.<br/><br/>Likstorm is the last and final part of the series of The Black Sun. It certainly works as a standalone adventure, but for those who played Vildhjarta, Sn&ouml;saga and Eldsj&auml;l, Likstorm continues an epic campaign that plays out over several years and across Osthem.<br/><br/>Likstorm is best suited for experienced players and the gamemaster should have at least some experience in running adventures before he / she tries running Likstorm.<br/><br/>The book presents a wealth of information about the town and castle Trollmark in the north of Osthem, as well as detailed information about the campaign, various locations and NPCs.<br/><br/><br/>From the back of the book (Swedish original)<br/><br/>Samund hade tj&auml;nat i Trollmark sedan han var gammal nog att b&auml;ra ett spjut. Till sina v&auml;nner r&auml;knade han br&ouml;derna Baldir och Hirmod vars far var Jorn Entloft.<br/><br/>Samund stod p&aring; murkr&ouml;net till den m&auml;ktiga borgen och k&auml;nde hur de kalla vindarna kom allt oftare. Det l&aring;g oro i luften, inte bara vintern var i ant&aring;gande. Han var inte den enda som k&auml;nde olusten. N&aring;gonting var fel n&aring;got h&ouml;ll p&aring; att h&auml;nda. Det ryktades om att hela v&auml;sterns l&auml;nder stod i brand, att krig r&aring;dde och att korparna aldrig hade kunnat &auml;ta sig s&aring; m&auml;tta som nu. Tvingade p&aring; kn&auml; hade l&auml;nderna p&aring; andra sidan Osterhavet v&auml;nt sig till Pater om hj&auml;lp och han hade h&ouml;rsammat deras v&auml;djan.<br/><br/>Vart han &auml;n gick innanf&ouml;r Trollmarks murar k&auml;nde han olust, och utanf&ouml;r murarna kunde man alltid f&ouml;rnimma stanken av d&ouml;d och f&ouml;rruttnelse.<br/><br/>P&aring; stigen som ledde in mot borgen s&aring;g han en man - eller var det en pojke - g&aring; mot porten. Fr&aring;n sin postering h&ouml;gt ovanf&ouml;r tyckte han att mannen s&aring;g ovanligt blek ut, dessutom hade han p&aring; tok for lite kl&auml;der p&aring; sig. Mannen bar ett stort sv&auml;rd &ouml;ver ryggen. Det var helt uppenbart att han var hirdman, men likv&auml;l tycktes det som om han inte blommat ut och blivit man &auml;nnu.<br/><br/>&quot;Avsl&ouml;ja ditt namn och ditt &auml;rende&quot;, skrek Samund fr&aring;n murkr&ouml;net.<br/><br/>Mannen stannade upp och tittade mot Samund.<br/><br/>&quot;Jag har kommit f&ouml;r att tj&auml;na, vad du kallar mig spelar ingen roll.&quot;<br/><br/>F&ouml;ga anade Samund att mannen bar p&aring; underg&aring;ngen och inget gott skulle komma av hans bes&ouml;k till Trollmark.<br/><br/>Likstorm heter den sista och avslutande delen i sviten om Den svarta solen. Det fungerar visserligen som ett frist&aring;ende &auml;ventyr men f&ouml;r dem som spelat Vildhjarta, Sn&ouml;saga och Eldsj&auml;l s&auml;tter Likstorm punkt f&ouml;r en episk kampanj som utspelat sig under flera &aring;r och &ouml;ver hela Osthem.<br/><br/>Likstorm l&auml;mpar sig b&auml;st for erfarna spelare och inte minst spelledaren b&ouml;r ha spellett n&aring;gra &auml;ventyr innan han/hon ger sig p&aring; Likstorm.<br/><br/>I boken finns en m&auml;ngd information om staden och borgen Trollmark i norra Osthem, liksom utf&ouml;rlig kampanjinformation om olika platser och spelledarpersoner.<br/><br/>"}, "82964": {"poll": [], "name": "Jetpac Refuelled", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Xbox Live Arcade version"], "average": "8", "videogameseries": ["Jetman"], "videogametheme": ["Science Fiction", "Space"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Rare"], "videogamegenre": ["Action", "Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Xbox 360"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Microsoft Game Studios"], "videogamecompilation": ["Rare Replay"], "description": "Jetpac Refuelled is a video game developed by Rare for the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade service.<br/> Gameplay<br/><br/>Jetpac Refuelled is an updated take on the original Jetpac with overhauled high-definition graphics and a total of 128 levels.

You might make good money with hotels, but first bridges must be built so that tourists, artists and business people of all kinds can flock to the islands. Plantations and cigar factories can show lush profits as well. Adventurers are attracted out to sea, where they dive for sunken shipwrecks and treasures. But the bottom line in Key West is that wanting everything is never a good goal.  Don't get bogged down; stay cool and plan your actions like a pro.<br/><br/>Key West is set in the 1930s and depicts the economic development of the Florida Keys. Players build hotels, maintain fruit plantations, buy cigar factories (both producing and selling), ensure that bridges are built, and search the deeps for treasure and wrecks. It features an original and surprising auction mechanism from Martin Schlegel.<br/><br/>The game is divided into two parts: first bidding, then actions.  At the beginning of each of the eight rounds, there is a offers phase, in which players bid to secure Key West cards, which represent, for example, ownership of bridges and plantations and other benefits for the subsequent actions round. Individual actions are a finite and players will need to approach them tactically.  It often won't be possible to do everything one wants and what not to do an agonizing decision.<br/><br/>Both experienced players and families will find something to like in Key West. There are seven different paths for generating victory points, but those who try to get involved everywhere won't succeed. The focus should be on three or four programs. In the next game one can try a different set.  As there are thus many combinations, the intentions is that matters stay fresh for many re-playings.<br/><br/>An Essen 2010 game.
