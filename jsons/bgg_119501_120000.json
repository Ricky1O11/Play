Program Power). The game was first released in 1982 for the BBC Micro. It was ported to the Acorn Electron (1983), Commodore 64 (1984) and Memotech MTX (1984).<br/><br/>The screen layout is clearly influenced by early platform game Space Panic, set out as a series of platforms and ladders populated by enemy 'gremlins' which also bear more than a passing resemblance to the Space Panic monsters. This is the factory of the title. The player takes the role of Felix, a factory worker, whose job is to ensure the generator, in the bottom right of the screen, does not run out of oil. Felix begins at the generator and must cross the conveyor belt, jumping over parcels (in gameplay similar to Donkey Kong). If Felix fails to jump the parcel, he falls down and is carried along the belt for a short while. If he has time to stand up, he can continue on as normal but if he reaches the end of the belt, he loses a life.<br/><br/>After crossing the conveyor belt, Felix can climb into the rest of the factory which contains a number of randomly placed items which can be picked up and used as well as a number of enemies. The main enemies are the various gremlins that patrol the platforms. If they come into contact with Felix, they knock him off the platform and a life is lost. The other hazard is a giant rat which occasionally runs across the screen, again knocking Felix off the platform (although unlike the gremlins, it can be jumped). Felix can collect a pitchfork which lets him run at the gremlins and knock them from the platforms. This only lasts for a brief time (like the axe in Donkey Kong). There is also a bag of rat poison which can be collected and then laid down on a platform in the hope that the rat will run across that platform. Finally, Felix can collect an oil can which he must take back to the generator. If the can is dropped (by running into a wall or falling on the conveyor belt), it spills and he must return for another can. Only one item can be carried at a time.<br/>The oil level is shown in a bar on screen and acts as a timer. As it runs down at a fast rate, the primary objective of the game is usually to collect the oil can and return it to the generator as quickly as possible. This is made especially important as if a life is lost, Felix is returned to the generator but the oil level remains as it was. If the player has spent too much time killing gremlins, this often makes it impossible for Felix to go back for the oil in time. There is a warning 'flicker' as the oil reaches a low level but unless Felix is already on the conveyor belt with a can of oil, it will be too late. If the generator runs out of oil, it is game over. If Felix successfully tops up the generator with oil, the gremlins regenerate (and sometimes increase in number) and play begins again.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Felix in the Factory&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119550": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1244408.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Eric M.

Two players, White and Black, take turns placing one ball of each color adjacent to each other. The balls can be placed on board holes or on top of 2x2 platforms of existing balls. You can place a ball on a hole and the other on a platform, as long as they touch each other.<br/><br/>Aim: without the left and right corner holes there are five columns with an odd number of balls on the pyramid surface (3-5-7-5-3). When the pyramid is complete, the player with the most visible balls in a column wins that column. The winner is the player who has won at least 3 columns.<br/><br/>Variant for expert players: players score one point when they have conquered a column composed by three balls, two points for a five balls column and three points for the seven balls column.

Those principles are known today by names such as Law of Attraction, Law of Allowing, Law of Gratitude, etc.<br/><br/>The idea, conceived by Theuns Serfontein in South Africa, was to use a board and card game (played much like a cross between Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit) to teach and promote these principles.  In 2010 the Law of Attraction worked to put Theuns together with Steve Vernon (a graphic and web designer in the United States) through an online marketing company in which they both were involved and, thanks to Skype, they became not only business partners, but very close friends.  A few months later, Theuns asked Steve to partner with him in his dream of creating &quot;grAtitude!&quot;- the game (originally called &quot;Bridge to Success&quot;).<br/><br/>The grAtitude! board game is played by tossing dice, moving around the &quot;G&quot;-shaped track, drawing cards from any of the four decks (depending on what space you land on), and following the instructions on the card within a certain time frame. You may, for example, have 30 seconds to name as many things as possible that start with the letter &quot;D&quot; that you're grateful for and win 1000 grati for each thing you name, or you might be told the Universe just rewarded you with 5,000 grati because you wrote down three daily goals this morning, or you might be asked to complete a famous quote or answer a multiple choice question.  With over 700 cards in the game, the possibilities are almost endless!<br/><br/>"}, "119580": {"poll": [], "name": "Sj\u00f8r\u00f8ver-skatten", "playingtime": "25", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "1941", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1384620_t.jpg", "average": "5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1384620.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Norwegian edition"], "maxplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Pirates", "Travel"], "age": "6", "minplaytime": "25", "description": "vintage roll dice and move game from 1941;<br/>Players start at the coast of South America and &quot;sails&quot; west. <br/>The target is being the first to Sail to the Tonga Isles in one piece and find the great Pirate treasure, all the while avoiding bad weather, pirates, coral reefs and other dangers along the way.<br/><br/>There is only one rather swirly route that takes you across the pacific oceans over towards Australia and The target Tonga Isles (passing Islands and groups like Tahiti, Baker Island, Gilbert Isle, St Cruz &amp; Fidji) and if you hit certain spots/numbers along the travel, actions are taken according to rulesheet.<br/><br/>"}, "119582": {"poll": [], "name": "AFL Challenge", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Australian PSP UMD edition", "PSP PlayStation Store edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Sports - Other"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Wicked Witch Software"], "videogamegenre": ["Sports"], "videogameplatform": ["PSP"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment", "Tru Blu Entertainment"], "description": "AFL Challenge is a sports game for the PlayStation Portable, based on the AFL.

The game board displays the six districts of Venice, and players earn VPs for placing council members into these, for building bridges and placing gondolas to connect the districts with one another, and for building advantageous buildings.<br/><br/>The game is played over six rounds, with each round consisting of three phases:<br/><br/>1. Acquire cards: Each player takes a set of cards.<br/>2. Play cards: Players use cards to perform certain actions.<br/>3. Activate buildings: Players may take advantage of their buildings and use their powers.<br/><br/>In phase 1, sets of eight cards are displayed (with six cards face-up and two face-down). Each player takes one set, then reduces his hand to seven cards. A card shows one of six specific characters (Architect, Merchant, etc.) or is a wild card.<br/><br/>Phase 2 consists of six sub-phases in a fixed order, one for each character. In each sub-phase, players choose whether or not to play one or more cards of that specific character. Each card allows them to perfom that character's action, for example:<br/><br/><br/>     Take one piece of gold for each Merchant card you play.<br/>     Place one council member into the current district for each Council card you play.<br/>     Take a building with a value equal to or lower than the number of Architect cards played. The higher its value, the better its function.<br/><br/><br/>Whoever plays the most cards in each such sub-phase receives a bonus of one free action of that type. In case of a tie, whoever is farthest along the &quot;Doge&quot; bar gets the bonus &ndash; and of course to advance on the Doge bar, players need to play Doge cards.<br/><br/>Finally, in phase 3, players may take advantage of their buildings. For each piece of gold paid, a player may use one of his building's ability.<br/><br/>Players collect VPs both during the game &ndash; from special buildings and by building bridges between districts &ndash; and at the end of it &ndash; for majorities of council members in each district. The value of each district evolves during the game: Each district is adjacent to four other ones, and at the end of the game, they will be connected either via bridges or gondolas. A bridge increases the value of the adjacent districts by 3-6 victory points, whereas a gondola increases this value by 1 point. The player with the most council members in a district earns VPs equal to the district's total value, the player with the secondmost council members earns half this value, and so on. While it's important to establish majorities in the districts, it's also crucial to control their values by cleverly placing those bridges and gondolas.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "English/German first edition", "Polish first edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "6.98958", "name": "Rialto", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "2928", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Cities: Venice", "Country: Italy"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["DdJ 018.

In the introductory scene we see the Quill editor telling Ron about a &quot;Monsters' Ball&quot;&mdash;a social event where all the Hollywood movie monsters have a big party at the mansion of Otto Hanover, a film producer. The editor stresses that The Quill must cover the event because it is too important to miss. Ron is not enthusiastic, but when Sue comes in Ron tells the editor how important it is that The Quill sends its best reporter and that he is the only one capable of accomplishing the task. This has the expected effect: Sue proclaims that she is the best journalist The Quill has and that there is no way Ron could do a decent job.

They allow troops a greater degree of flexibility, and better Leaders will be able to motivate and lead their men more effectively.  They do this through Command Points.  Points may be spent to coax and motivate, direct actions more effectively, increase die sizes and more.

There is generally a question as to what a character would be able to find and subsequently purchase with the Resource they find. Under most circumstances, the rules in the book are more than sufficient at covering a broad range of common items that can be found in the garage, storeroom, behind counters, etc. But this may not be enough for the GM who knows a location well enough to know precisely what is available and in roughly what quantity. Also, a GM who desires to inspire a higher degree of fear in their players by making certain resources extremely finite (even those that are otherwise common) would benefit from adapting the rules in the Outbreak: Undead core rulebook to incorporate such a frightening reality. An entirely optional, but efficient, way to accomplish this is by using a &quot;Resource Catalog&quot;.<br/><br/>A &quot;Resource Catalog&quot; is a list of what a character is able to purchase with their available Resource. What is on this list is based on the locations that the characters loot during missions or what kind of location they are in when the game starts. For most scenarios, the items are automatically added to the catalog once the location is successfully searched. The master list that a can be purchased from when characters are in their Stronghold is the &quot;Strongohld Resource Catalog&quot;.

Set in deep space, players are thrust into the command chair of space station about to come under heavy attack and must deploy their defenses to respond.<br/><br/>Solar defense is all about perfecting base design. There are 8 basic towers in the game, all of which can be upgraded to perform specific functions or optimized damage certain enemy types. As the station can only support an limited number of towers the player has to make tough decisions such as rationing the number of reactors to fit another missile turret or shield on.<br/><br/>Unlike most tower defense games where tower upgrades are capped, Solar Defense features a unique upgrade system. The functions of each tower can be improved indefinitely however each upgrade costs increasingly more than the last and provides diminishing returns. To fuel upgrades, the station can salvage resources or mine them nearby asteroids however as the station takes damage these resources get shunted to repairs making defense as important as offense.<br/><br/>Eventually the station will succumb under the onslaught which is rendered in full 3D giving you that &quot;oh hell&quot; feeling as your base is swarmed by hundreds of ships ranging from attack fighters to enormous capital ships. Despite your inevitable demise, the game makes you want to try &quot;just one more round&quot;.<br/>If you do well enough in a level you'll unlock a unique and powerful technology.<br/><br/>Overall Solar Defense is worth a look for anyone who has an interest in RTS or tower defense games. It is accessible to most players and comes with a tutorial that steps you through all the basics. Perfect for the casual gamer with most runs lasting around an hour.<br/><br/>"}, "119706": {"poll": [], "name": "Metre Litre Gram Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1468446_t.png", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unknown)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1468446.png", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Educational", "Math"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "The Metre Litre Gram Game is the fun way to learn metric.<br/><br/>The game consists of a playing board, six player tokens, two dice, five decks of cards (metre, litre, gram, chance, and exam), a rule sheet and a sheet that explains the metric system.<br/><br/>The path on the board is in the shape of the letter m, which stands for metre.

They gather their two close friends and instruct them to go around town and pick up as many friends as possible, and the one who does is the winner of their little game. The game plays out on two levels. In the first, players advance from space to space along a board game track. Each space has a mini-game which requires the players to ride ATVs, jet skis, cars, go rock climbing, or perform other adventure related tasks. Successfully completing the games will allow a player to pick up friends and eventually win the game.<br/><br/>There are four players your can choose from, each with respected colors, including Mary-Kate, Ashley, Claire and Tiffany (blue, red, yellow and green, respectfully.) At the beginning of the game, each player picks which character they want to be, and a number wheel of one to ten is spun for each. The player stops the wheel whenever they choose, and highest number gets to play first, second highest plays next etc. You are in a car that is your avatar's respected color and for the first round, you move as many spaces as your number wheel stopped on. (For each level, you spin the number wheel again.) The kind of marker you land on in the road could signify many different events. The winner of each events gets a certain number of coins which can be used to buy things like gas, if needed.<br/><br/>Single Player Challenge- only the player in the car gets to play a game, randomly chosen (though in some cases, what you see around the car gives hints to what game you're getting. For example, if your car parks next to the ocean with canoes in the water, you have a higher chance of getting a rafting game.)<br/><br/>Multi-player Challenge- Same as the single player, but this time you could play with one, two, or all the other players. The teams are divided at random, but for certain games (like tag) it might be 3 against one, so the player who landed on the marker is the 1 against the other 3.<br/><br/>'Bad' Events- Any number of 'bad' events can occur to the player. You can get sent back on the board however many spaces you roll on the number wheel, there can be an earthquake, roadblock, your car breaks down, or you loose a friend out of your car.<br/><br/>Pick Up a Friend- The closest friend on the sidewalk will get into your car with you. Adding friends can normally make any player first place if you have more. The player can add up to three friends in their car, but these friends do not help with challenges and can leave the car if a 'bad' event occurs.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player who has the most coins and picked up the most friends is the winner, regardless of who actually makes it to the finish line first.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Mary-Kate and Ashley: Sweet 16&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119745": {"rpgartist": ["Ralf Berszuck", "Arndt Drechsler", "Markus Holzum", "Daniel J\u00f6demann", "Rich Longmore", "S\u0142awomir Maniak", "Jan-Hendrik Sonnwald", "Mia Steingr\u00e4ber", "Sabine Weiss"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version", "Saddle stapled version", "Space: 1889 Quickstarter"], "statistics": [], "name": "Space: 1889 - Schnellstartregeln & Abenteuer", "rpgdesigner": ["Jeff Combos", "Patric G\u00f6tz", "David Grashoff", "Dominic Hladek", "Andrew McColl", "Matthias Reppisch"], "rpgproducer": ["Ralf Berszuck", "Daniel Bruxmeier", "Florian Don-Schauen", "Patric G\u00f6tz", "Nicole Heinrichs", "Dominic Hladek", "Stefan K\u00fcppers", "Daniel U.

If the football falls on the picture of an opposing player or in an open field, the opponent takes control of the ball.

It was intended to be an entry-level computer to replace the VIC-20 and it often sold for 99 USD. A cost-reduced version, the Commodore 116, was sold only in Europe.<br/><br/>Outwardly the C16 resembled the VIC-20 and the C64, but with a dark gray case and light gray keys. The keyboard layout differed slightly from the earlier models, adding an escape key and four cursor keys replacing the shifted-key arrangement inherited from the C-64 and VIC. Performance-wise located between the VIC-20 and 64, it had 16 kilobytes of RAM with 12 KB available to its built-in BASIC interpreter, and a new sound and video chipset offering a palette of 128 colors (in reality 121, since the system had a 16 base colors and 8 shades but black always remained black, with all 8 shades), the TED (better than the VIC used in the VIC-20, but lacking the sprite capability of the VIC-II and advanced sound capabilities of the SID, both used in the C64). The ROM resident BASIC 3.5, however, was more powerful than the VIC-20's and C64's BASIC 2.0, in that it had commands for sound and bitmapped graphics (320&times;200 pixels), as well as simple program tracing/debugging.<br/><br/>The C16 was a flop in the US and was discontinued within a year, but it sold reasonably well in Europe as a low-end game machine (over 90% of all C16 software was produced by European developers) and in Mexico as well.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Commodore 16&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119779": {"statistics": [], "name": "Commodore Plus/4", "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Console"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamehwmfg": ["Commodore International Limited (Commodore)"], "poll": [], "videogamehwversion": ["Commodore Plus/4"], "videogamehardware": ["Commodore Plus/4"], "description": "The Commodore Plus/4 was a home computer released by Commodore International in 1984. The &quot;Plus/4&quot; name refers to the four-application ROM resident office suite (word processor, spreadsheet, database, and graphing); it was billed as &quot;the productivity computer with software built-in&quot;. It had some success in Europe, though it was a total flop in the United States.<br/><br/>The TED offered 121-color (15 colors &times; 8 luminance levels + black) video, a palette matched only by Atari Computers at the time, and 320&times;200 video resolution, which was standard for computers intended to be capable of connecting to a television. The Plus/4's memory map gave it a larger amount of user-accessible memory than the C64, and its BASIC programming language was vastly improved, adding sound and graphics commands as well as looping commands that improved program structure. Commodore released a high-speed floppy disk drive for the Plus/4, the Commodore 1551, which offered much better performance than the C64/1541 combination because it used a parallel interface rather than a serial bus. However, the Plus/4 did not have the parallel interface built-in; it was provided by a plug-in cartridge supplied with the drive.<br/><br/>Unlike the C64 which emulated the 6551 chip in software, the Plus/4 had a built-in MOS Technology 6551 UART chip that could perform up to 19200 bit/s. This allowed the Plus/4 to use high-speed modems without additional hardware or software tricks (the C64 required specially written software to operate at 2400 bit/s). But most people could only afford 300- or 1200-bit/s modems in 1984&mdash;and Commodore never released a 2400-bit/s modem&mdash;so this feature went largely unnoticed. The Plus/4 keyboard had a separately placed directional &quot;diamond&quot; of four cursor keys, presumably more intuitive to use than the VIC's and C64's two shifted cursor keys. A reset button was added on the right side of the system, a feature lacking on the C-64. Also, for serious programmers, the Plus/4 featured a ROM-resident machine code monitor, which rekindled a tradition from the first Commodore computers.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Commodore Plus/4&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119780": {"statistics": [], "name": "VIC-20", "videogamehardwarecategory": ["Console"], "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamehwmfg": ["Commodore International Limited (Commodore)"], "poll": [], "videogamehwversion": ["Japanese VIC-1001", "VIC-20"], "videogamehardware": ["VIC-20"], "description": "The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer which was sold by Commodore Business Machines.<br/><br/>The VIC-20 had proprietary connectors for program/expansion cartridges and a tape drive (PET-standard Datassette). It came with 5 kB RAM, but 1.5&amp; kB was used by the system for various things, like the video display (which had a rather unusual 22&times;23 char/line screen layout), and other dynamic aspects of the ROM-resident BASIC interpreter and KERNAL (a low-level operating system). Thus, 3583 bytes of BASIC program memory for code and variables was available to the user of an unexpanded machine.<br/><br/>The computer also had a serial bus (a serial version of the PET's IEEE-488 bus) for daisy chaining disk drives and printers; a TTL-level &quot;user port&quot; with both RS-232 and Centronics signals (most frequently used as RS-232, for connecting a modem); and a single DE-9 game controller port, compatible with the digital joysticks and paddles used with Atari 2600 videogame consoles and, later, the C64 (the use of a standard port ensured ample supply of Atari-manufactured and other third-party joysticks; Commodore itself offered an Atari-protocol joystick under the Commodore brand).<br/><br/>Importantly, like most video game consoles and many computers at the time the VIC had a cartridge port to allow for plug-in cartridges with games and other software as well as for adding memory to the machine. Port expander boxes were available from Commodore and other vendors to allow more than one cartridge to be attached at a time. Cartridge software ranged from 4-16k in size, although the latter was uncommon due to its cost and only larger software houses produced 16k cartridges.<br/><br/>The graphics capabilities of the VIC chip (6560/6561) were limited but flexible. At startup the screen showed 176 x 184 pixels, with a fixed-colour border to the edges of the screen; since an NTSC or PAL screen has a 4:3 width-to-height ratio, each VIC pixel was much wider than it was high. The screen normally showed 22 columns and 23 rows of 8-by-8-pixel characters; it was possible to increase these dimensions but the characters would soon run out the sides of the monitor. Like on the PET, 256 different characters could be displayed at a time, normally taken from one of the two character generators in ROM (one for upper-case letters and simple graphics, the other for mixed-case&mdash;non-English characters were not provided). Normally, the VIC-20 was operated in high-resolution mode whereby each character was 8x8 pixels in size and used one color. A lower-resolution multicolor mode could also be used with 4x8 characters and three colors each, but it was not used as often due to its extreme blockiness.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Commodore VIC-20&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119781": {"image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1315362.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Ben Harkins"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2012", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Shamas Demoret", "Steve Maggart", "Peter Wocken"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Floodgate Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1315362_t.png", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Exploration", "Science Fiction"], "description": "Legacy: Gears of Time is a strategic card game, mechanically rooted in its time travel theme. Players each play cards from their own hand, draw from a central draw pile, move and play technologies on a single timeline, while placing their influence cubes on existing technologies.<br/><br/>Legacy is played on a timeline that grows at the end of each of 4 rounds. Players take turns during a round consisting of 3 actions each. During each turn, you may travel back in time, play a technology card from your hand, influence an existing technology, or draw two cards (keeping only one).<br/><br/>As you travel back in time, Technologies are played from your hand by paying their discard cost. Any technologies you play generate influence for you automatically.<br/><br/>Having more influence than your opponents is the key to claiming rewards for a technology! At the end of each round, rewards are given for each technology and its dependencies. One Influence cube from each technology will come off at the end of each round, forming your influence pool to be used in future rounds to influence existing technologies. Keep in mind, a technology is only considered successful if all of its dependencies exist previously on the timeline.<br/><br/>Since there are several copies of each technology, you may be able to preempt and eliminate an existing copy by playing yours earlier in the timeline!  Be sure there is room for your new technology, though; each time-frame has a capacity equal to it's distance from the present.<br/><br/>There are also a few rare but powerful Fate cards, each allowing you to break the rules in interesting ways. Fate cards have no discard cost and don't require an action to be played.<br/><br/>By strategically influencing existing technologies, adapting to your opponents actions, and carefully choosing when to go further back in time, you will find yourself victorious over your rivals!

With time, the Hyperboreans became greedy, and their search for power in the deep made the crystals unstable, causing earthquakes, mutations, droughts and floods. Hyperboreans just dug deeper, and only a few wise mages, foreseeing the inevitable, built an unbreakable magical barrier. When the unharnessed magical energy was unleashed from the deep, the Hyperborean civilization was destroyed in a single day, only the magical barrier preventing the disappearance of life from the whole land. The survivors living in the small outposts outside Hyperborea were now sealed out by the barrier. The knowledge of crystals was declared forbidden it was because too dangerous, or simply forgotten.<br/><br/>Over centuries, six rival realms were born from the ashes of the Hyperborean civilization: the militarist Red Duchy; the Emerald Kingdom and its death-delivering archers; the Purple Matriarchy fanatically worshipping the goddess of life; the skilled diplomats and merchants of the Golden Barony; the Coral Throne with its efficiently organized society and finally the secluded and enigmatic Celestial Reign.<br/><br/>The fragile peace between the different realms was not intended to last. One day, the magical barrier suddenly collapsed. A whole new land stood in front of the six kingdoms, still haunted by the old Hyperboreans turned into harmless but ominous ghosts, full of ruins to discover and cities to explore. Each realm is now sending its best warriors and explorers to Hyperborea in order to achieve dominance over their rivals, but which will prevail? Brutal strength or deep understanding of science? The discovery of valuable artifacts in the lost ruins or the retaking of long, lost cities? Only you, as the leader of one of the factions, can lead your people to the ultimate dominance over Hyperborea!<br/><br/>Set in a mythical land of the same name, Hyperborea is a light civilization game for 2 to 6 players that takes 20-25 minutes per player. The game begins at the time when the magic barrier protecting access to the mythical continent of Hyperborea suddenly falls.<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of the leader of a small kingdom situated just outside the now open to be conquered and explored land. Her kingdom has limited knowledge of housing, trade, movement, warfare, research, and growth, but new and exciting powers are hidden in Hyperborea. During the game, this kingdom will grow in numbers and raise armies, extend its territory, explore and conquer, learn new technologies, etc...<br/><br/>The game's main mechanism, which can be described as &quot;bag-building&quot;, involves you building a pool of &quot;civilicubes&quot;. Each cube represents specializations for your kingdom: war, trade, movement, building, knowledge, growth. Grey cubes represent corruption and waste, and players will acquire them by developing new technologies. (Power corrupts by its own definition, and the more complex a society becomes, the more waste it generates.) Each turn, players draw three random cubes from their bags, then use them to activate knowledge (technologies) they own.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition", "German first edition", "Italian first edition"], "average": "7.3336", "name": "Hyperborea", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Deck / Pool Building", "Grid Movement", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["Hyperborea: Light & Shadow", "Hyperborea: Promo Set"], "usersrated": "2703", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Components: Miniatures"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 013 \u2013 Gaming Events", "Dukes of Dice - Ep. 63 - The Space Between", "Episode 19 - Hybrid Games", "Episode 25 - What Do Those \u201cX\u2019s\u201d Stand for, Again?", "Episode 5 - Sandy Petersen Interview And Premium Games", "ET100: El Ajedrez en las 5 Tribus.

These people are called Exiles; they step or turn out of our world, the world of crowded freeways and glittering convenience stores and into the Second World, a place of magic, mystery, danger, and more than a little bit of terror. There are two worlds you see, separated by a roiling gulf of chaos called the Forge.<br/><br/>The Second World Sourcebook bridges the gap between modern day adventuring and traditional fantasy roleplaying. It provides a &quot;campaign template&quot; for running a dual-world game. By combining the sourcebook with your own favorite setting you can take your fantasy characters and run them through a modern day scenario, or take your modern characters and run them through one of the many fantasy modules currently available. Most modern settings already describe the impact of fantasy elements on them and include rules for handling magic. But what would happen if people from the modern world regularly trafficked with those in a more traditional fantasy world? What impact would it have if powerful wizards originally studied computer science at UCLA? What would the social institutions look like if the progress of ideas and politics we've seen in our world carried over to a place where electricity and gunpowder simply didn't work, but magic and divine power did?<br/><br/>The Sourcebook supports both the d20 Modern Rules and the standard d20 rules and provides a complete set of genre and technology rules for customizing the way reality works in the two worlds, in alternate planes, or even in your own game world. Over 200 powers spread across 8 prestige classes (with an alternate, feat-based system)are detailed. Each class gets to pick one ability per level from a list of at least 25 special powers; this provides maximum customizability in character development. It also includes a complete set of influence rules with over 30 organizations and 100 favors to request; this system provides a nifty method for adding crunch to the political aspect of a game.

That&rsquo;s what they do. Fighting is their job. At least that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll tell you. More realistically orcs bully. They like to boss others around. But bullying requires a kind of power that individuals typically lack. Thus, orcs gang up. But, and any orc will tell you this, when you&rsquo;re a gang you need a cool name, one that strikes fear in the hearts of the timid, one that represents power and strength, a name to make people tremble. Unfortunately, orcs also tend to lack much in imagination. To get into the mindset go back a bit, perhaps to your junior high school days and think about the representation of power. What were its symbols? Weapons are good but there are lots of weapons; perhaps a bigger weapon then but when used as a symbol all weapons look about the same size. Perhaps an exotic weapon then; well, it&rsquo;d be pretty messed up to have your symbol be a weapon that no one in your gang could pronounce. Armor simply won&rsquo;t do at all since that implies people will be hitting you and not the other way around. What&rsquo;s left then? The fist. The fist represents the most simple raw form of power; through the fist one exerts one&rsquo;s strength. The fist wields the sword and the axe. The fist is all you have left when stripped naked. A plain old fist won&rsquo;t do; perhaps its wielding some lightning, or wearing a gauntlet (Iron Fist tends to be popular) but, if you&rsquo;re an orc you&rsquo;re going to be asking someone distinctly lacking in artistic talent to paint this on your shield or tattoo it on your chest. That leaves you with a simple color. And, like everything else in orc life, colors occupy their own hierarchy with black clearly at the top (red comes close but you know it simply doesn&rsquo;t strike dread the way black does). All this has led to a brutal social Darwinism over nothing more than the fight over gang names. If you want to be in the Black Fist gang you need to make sure no one else uses the symbol. Think of it as a very personal form of trademark protection. And once you&rsquo;ve established yourself as the Black Fist orcs you&rsquo;ve got to make sure you only recruit the best, the meanest, and the toughest orcs out there. They&rsquo;ve got to chew iron and spit nails. They&rsquo;ve got to have a ruthless streak a league wide and they&rsquo;ve got to be the kind of orc that won&rsquo;t let anyone else call themselves a Black Fist without spilling some blood.<br/><br/>"}, "119815": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Adventure Toolkit: Organizations Book 2 \u2013 Amethyst Legion", "rpgdesigner": ["Steven Palmer Peterson"], "rpgproducer": ["Steven Palmer Peterson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1229230.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.0 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Second World Simulations"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1229230_t.png", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>About a century ago Lord Trespass fought a war against the agiat (see pg.

Trespass studied his military history, so he marshaled his forces and struck at the center of the agiat lines hoping to separate their force into two groups then destroy them piecemeal. The Fifth Legion led his drive to the Bronze Wall. The spearhead thrust turned into a catastrophic failure. Suffering from a constant string of losses, the agiat had replaced their commander with a bright young officer. He wouldn&rsquo;t survive the war (Trespass hunted him down and had him killed) but he saw his position and knew his enemy. When the Fifth Legion drove he gave way. When the third and parts of the fourth legion followed into the open gap he collapsed his wings.

When a player thinks he has enough for the journey, he takes off.<br/>In a turn, a player has three options: spend two tokens and move one step for each ox you have; move one step without spending tokens; or remain where he is.<br/>If a player moves to a new mapboard, he has to roll the stick beforehand to see which board is placed. After this each player has the option to place a village marker.<br/>On each map section the terrain changes; on a number of special places a player may perform different useful tasks, such as refilling his supply of water, food or acquire an ox.<br/><br/>Villages are useful to buy supplies. Markers that show the 'pax' side consider the village to be friendly, however, when the village is hostile, it attacks the expedition. All oxes and scout then are placed in the bag together with three neutral green tokens. Two tokens drawn from the bag are considered lost.<br/>If the village is friendly, the stick is rolled. The dots shown is the number of resource tokens a player gets for each silver coin in this village.<br/>When the first player reaches the end of the road by exact count, he wins.<br/><br/>"}, "119817": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Role-playing Poem"], "poll": [], "name": "Boredom", "rpgdesigner": ["Lasse Lundin"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2905488.jpg", "usersrated": "2", "average": "4.75", "rpggenre": ["Weird / Surreal"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["Boredom"], "rpgpublisher": ["(Web published)"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpgseries": ["The Role-playing Poem Challenge"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2905488_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Lasse Lundin's entry into The Role-playing Poem Challenge.

By combining the sourcebook with your own favorite setting you can take your fantasy characters and run them through a modern day scenario, or take your modern characters and run them through one of the many fantasy modules currently available. Most modern settings already describe the impact of fantasy elements on them and include rules for handling magic. But what would happen if people from the modern world regularly trafficked with those in a more traditional fantasy world? What impact would it have if powerful wizards originally studied computer science at UCLA?

For the most part the players don&rsquo;t have to fight much; in fact they&rsquo;ll probably only face three fights in the entire scenario. Instead they have numerous opportunities to talk with people and investigate leads. This requires a bit more thinking but some of that thinking involves how best to get weapons, big vicious weapons; that should mollify those offended by too much talking.<br/><br/>This is an event based scenario. These can be difficult to pull off right. The Cause and Effect section describes the method used to &ldquo;map&rdquo; out this scenario. This technique should provide a strong plot for the scenario, but not a plot for the players. Instead the antagonists have their own plots, follow their own agendas, and oftentimes those agendas place the players at risk. The players have only the plot they create themselves. They&rsquo;re the monkey wrench trying to break up the machinations of the bad guys; they&rsquo;re the targets trying to survive an array of forces bent on their destruction. How each group does that will be radically different from each other group. The fact that people hunt them makes it easier to have the adventure find the players, so there&rsquo;s less necessity to keep the scenario on track.<br/><br/>"}, "119830": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Skill Focus: Talking", "rpgdesigner": ["Steven Palmer Peterson"], "rpgproducer": ["Steven Palmer Peterson"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1229958.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["d20 System / OGL Product (D&D 3.5 Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Second World Simulations"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpggenre": ["Generic / Universal"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1229958_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>This smallish book offers a new approach to handling roleplaying skills and encounters -- and should work in any d20 System based game, even most of the ones that no longer use the logo.<br/><br/>These rules take a different approach in an effort to make it feel more like the character's skills have a direct impact on the way the roleplaying of the scene plays out, without reducing the entire exchange to a die roll. The idea is to help the player be a better negotiator, by giving them special benefits based on their character's skills.<br/><br/>The basic premise is that each of the major interaction skills, Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive, offer a variety of special talking actions. While roleplaying out an encounter, the player can make a skill check for their character and, if it succeeds, gain some special benefit during the roleplaying of the encounter.<br/><br/>For example, if Talarn tells the leader of a barbarian tribe that Talarn's group just took out the goblins in the nearby hills, then realizes that the barbarians were actually quite friendly with those goblins (perhaps by noticing all the weapons being drawn), then Talarn could use the Bluff skill's Take Back action to make it as if Talarn had never said that.<br/><br/>"}, "119831": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["First Printing"], "poll": [], "name": "Armageddon 2092 - Mars", "rpgdesigner": ["S\u00e1ndor Szigeti"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1610708.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissuearticle": ["Armageddon kritika"], "rpg": ["Armageddon 2092 - Mars"], "rpgpublisher": ["B\u00edborhold"], "statistics": [], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction (Post Apocalypse)"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1610708_t.jpg", "description": "From the designer:<br/><br/>Armageddon 2092 - Mars is a cyberpunk/science fiction game with some postholocaust-like feeling. The time is 2092, the place is the more or less colonized (but still quite alien) Mars. One day six comets dash into the Earth out of the blue. It seems that everyone has died and the colonists of Mars are left on their own. As if it were not enough, alien spaceships appear at the edge of the solar system and mysterious alien warriors start a vietkong-like terrorist activity on Mars.<br/><br/>The system worked like this: there were five main attributes, with 3 subtypes in each main attribute (as in Wizards of the Coast's Envoy system, used with written permission), each ranging normally from -5 to +5, 0 being the average. The skills were linked to these attributes. When using a skill (either in combat or elsewhere), you had to add the value of the appropriate attribute, the modifiers and the result of 2D6 to the skill, and if this sum reached the target number, you succeeded. By using not only the sum of the dice rolls, but also the difference between them (as a damage multiplier), you could determine the success of an attack and the damage with a single 2D6 roll (the system used only six-sided dice).<br/><br/>Later B'borhold Budapest published an anthology of short stories based on the world of Armageddon (its title was &quot;Angyal, ha langol&quot; -- &quot;Angel, flaming&quot;.) From these stories you learned more about the fate of Earth, and the aliens, for example that they weren't aliens at all, but they the descendants of the long lost Dravidan people, who were more advanced in science and magic than the rest of humanity, but their hands were tied by the strict theocratic system. (A bit like the Fremens in Dune, but they obviously aren't the same.)<br/><br/>The RPG was printed in 2000 copies, which was sold out in two weeks. It was a success for the publisher, but not -- at least in economical terms -- for the author: he didn't receive a buck for all his work, so he didn't care about it, and the game slowly disappeared (it was not supported at all by the publisher, who soon went broke anyway).<br/><br/>"}, "119832": {"rpgdesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["Version 6.4 PDF"], "poll": [], "name": "BrightSword Core Rulebook (Playtest)", "rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1233003.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["BrightSword"], "rpgpublisher": ["DGS Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Core Rules (min needed to play)"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1233003_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher's description:<br/>BrightSword is DGS Games&rsquo; fantasy roleplaying game system set in our world of Faelon.<br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/>BrightSword is a set of fantasy roleplaying rules set in the world of Faelon&mdash;a world of great beauty and great danger, of politics and religion, intrigue and honor, people and power, magic and mystery.<br/>More than a dozen factions strive for domination and survival across Faelon&lsquo;s two known continents.

It was once a magical place, protected from monsters and mishaps by beautiful Guardian Genies. Their heroism won long years of peace, during which many of the genies fell in love with mortal men. The resulting offspring were all girls, seemingly human but with a trace of magical power, often lying dormant or manifesting in unusual ways. Thus half-genies came into the world.<br/><br/>Sadly, as the ages passed large numbers of Guardian Genies began to disappear from Sequin Land until not one remained. Many folks imagined that they had been captured inside bottles, while others believed that the genies had returned to their own realm. With the guardians gone, Sequin Land began to fall prey to evil.<br/><br/>In spite of their lack of skills, the daughters of the Genies made a decision to pool their powers and stand against evil as best they could. Few and far between, these half-genies traveled the land, each choosing a kingdom to guard until peace could be won again. As they struggle to keep the peace, new villains emerge and ancient foes return to wreak havoc on Sequin Land. Is this newest generation of Guardian Genies up to the challenge?<br/><br/>The game's story focuses on a young &quot;half-genie&quot; by the name of Shantae. Having been appointed as the Guardian Genie of a small fishing town, Shantae's life is fairly quiet. That quickly changes when a gang of pirates, led by the sinister Risky Boots, attacks the town and steals a prototype steam engine from the town's resident Relic Hunter, Mimic.<br/><br/>Shantae soon finds herself traveling far and wide across Sequin Land, determined to retrieve the steam engine and foil Risky's wicked plan.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Shantae&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "119848": {"poll": [], "name": "Panzer Corps Grand Campaign '42", "videogamemode": ["Hotseat", "Network Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition", "Windows DVD edition"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1230834.jpg", "videogametheme": ["War - World War II"], "usersrated": "4", "videogameexpansion": ["Panzer Corps Wehrmacht", "Panzer Corps: Afrika Korps"], "videogamedeveloper": ["The Lordz Games Studio"], "videogamegenre": ["Strategy"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "8.75", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Matrix Games", "Slitherine Ltd."], "videogamecompilation": ["Panzer Corps Grand Campaign Mega Pack '39 - '45"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1230834_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the box<br/><br/>March 20th, 1942<br/><br/>Poland, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece.

It tracks the motions your head make. Early models only followed up-down and left-right motions (2 Degrees Of Freedom) but since 2004 TrackIR is capable of tracking the full 6DOF. So that's on top of the mentioned 2DOF the possibility to tilt your head sideways, or shift it sideways, shift up or down or shift left-right. <br/>This allows the user to play games with hands-free view control. That both greatly enhances both situational awareness (as it's much easier to look around you) and game immersion (as the camera view responds to your head movements).<br/><br/>To make it work, the TrackIR comes with a small video camera which you mount on top of your monitor. And it comes with a small device emitting infrared light (hence the name). Of that tool different versions exist and they are either baseball cap mounted, or you can attach them to your headphones, depending on the model you buy.<br/><br/>The TrackIR comes with it's own software, which allows you to make a specific profiles, so you can use different profiles in different games. Profiles exist of info about how much the camera view should respond to your head movements (so for instance: a slight side look is good for either a 25 degree camera turn, or a full 180) and also info about a 'dead zone' so your camera view won't become jerky due to your slightest head movements.<br/><br/>"}, "119868": {"rpgdesigner": ["Bill Barsh"], "rpgitemversion": ["Print version"], "rpgseries": ["Pacesetter Adventure Modules"], "name": "Six Feet Under", "rpgartist": ["Chris Curtin"], "rpgproducer": ["(Uncredited)"], "image": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1230164.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "rpg": ["AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products", "Old School Reference and Index Compilation (OSRIC)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Pacesetter Games & Simulations"], "poll": [], "rpgcategory": ["Scenario / Adventure / Module"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy"], "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1230164_t.jpg", "description": "From the publishers website:<br/><br/>Something is not quite right at the graveyard.

Each player begins the game controlling a cowboy that is pre-generated. The cowboys start the game in the end of a canyon near their home town just after being caught in a flash flood on their way back from a cattle drive. Throughout the canyon they see materials scattered all over and someone remembers the payroll was on the chuck-wagon and probably in one of those piles of rubble. Suddenly the players begin to eye each other suspiciously as each decides they want all the gold for themselves. To make matters worse some of the other members of the cattle drive, the ones that didn't survive are getting up and moving towards the cowboys with a hungry look in their eyes. Most of the cowboys are armed with a six gun, but these zombies are endless and their ammo isn't. Now the cowboys must work together against the army of undead in order to survive, but in the back of each cowboy's mind is the payroll, and the chance that one of their fellow cowboys will turn on them.<br/><br/>The main objective of the game is to escape the canyon alive. However if multiple players escape the canyon then the player with the most gold is declared the winner. For a single player game the player must search all twenty boxes and escape the canyon alive.<br/><br/>Ages: 8+ <br/>Games will last approximately a half hour to an hour.<br/><br/>"}, "119887": {"poll": [], "name": "Found in the Kitchen", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Paper-and-Pencil"], "yearpublished": "1935", "usersrated": "1", "boardgamefamily": ["Food / Cooking"], "maxplayers": "0", "thumbnail": "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1232780_t.jpg", "average": "3", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["C.W.

The game contains mechanisms that are not normally seen in educational games, and the effect is learning through engagement (fun).  It also features attractive youth-friendly graphic design to further increase the accessibility, engagement and desire to play.  Don't Push Your Luck combines light strategy of a family Euro with the fun and social exploration of a Party Game.<br/><br/>Just Another Day<br/>Each player in Don&rsquo;t Push Your Luck takes on the role of a child with hemophilia competing to have the most well balanced lifestyle, while trying to manage the risk they take in their activities. Players will be faced with the constant challenge of balancing of risk vs reward.  The game is played over three rounds, each representing one full day.<br/><br/>There is a central board surrounded by 16 activity cards, that are randomly drawn before the beginning of each round.  Each activity card represents a specific type of health: mental, social, emotional, and physical.  In turn, players go around the board picking up activity cards and placing them in their player area.  This represent them performing this activity.  For example: on your turn you may choose to take the &ldquo;hockey&rdquo; activity card.  Hockey provides 2 physical icons on it.  These icons are later used to obtain &ldquo;stars&rdquo;, at the various &ldquo;star spaces&rdquo; around the board.  The player with the most &ldquo;stars&rdquo; at the end of the game is declared the winner. <br/>  <br/>Inciting Discussion<br/>Players must be mindful of the activities they choose to participate in during the day, because at the end of every round (3 total), each player tells a story about their day by describing each of the activities they selected.  When the storyteller is finished telling describing each of their selected activities, the other players have an opportunity to discuss which of those activities they felt were not in the best interest of the story teller.   The storyteller will often be trying to play down the risk of their selected activities, as they will be judged by the other players.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "age": "8", "name": "Don't Push Your Luck!", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Set Collection", "Storytelling"], "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Games by the Game Artisans of Canada"]}, "119907": {"rpgdesigner": ["Conrad Clark", "Morten Olsen", "Sean Poindexter", "Dmitri Zorin"], "statistics": [], "name": "Quoth the Raven (Issue 4 - 2005)", "rpgproducer": ["Stephen C.

Forget the luxury of contemporary firepower and equipment. In 1917, aerial combat was intimate, and the tools of the trade limited to a machine run, nerves of steel, sharp wits and reflexes, and chance.<br/><br/>Extensive research, meticulous modeling and advanced programming techniques mean unprecedented historical accuracy, breathtaking live landscapes, and authentic aircraft handling to unsettle the strongest stomachs. The result is more than mere flight simulation. Flying Corps is an exciting and exhilarating rendition of life and death in the skies of the Great War.<br/><br/><br/>     Rewrite history in four full blown campaigns from the allied and enemy perspective. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Join the Hat-In-The-Ring Squadron, the Jasta 11 Squadron, the Royal Flying Corps or take part in the Battle of Cambrai and attempt to better the skills and kills of airborne aces such as Eddie Rickenbacker and Baron Manfred Von Richthofen. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Feel the benefits of detailed flight models in action and discover the true meaning of adverse yaw, gyroscopic force, torque, slipstream and inherent structural integrity. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Beautifully built (and customizable) aircraft include the Sopwith Camel, Nieuport Scout, Spad XIII, Albatross DIII and Fokker DRI Triplane. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Breathtaking high-resolution three-dimensional landscapes recreated from archive material, period aerial photography and satellite and cruise missile contour data. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Believable computer-controlled pilots with artificial intelligence that learn from their experiences. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Multiple skill settings cater to novices and veterans. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Comes complete with an authentic replica pilots manual and terrain maps. <br/><br/><br/>Flight sims don't get more real than Flying Corps.<br/><br/>Inside Box Flap<br/><br/>Take control of the Albatross DIII, Fokker D.R.1 Triplane, SE5a, Sopwith Camel and Nieuport Scout: Six beautifully modeled aircraft, accurate down to the smallest historical and technical detail, and with fully customizable paint schemes.

The flight models are so comprehensive you can feel the effects of the adverse yaw, gyroscopic force, torque, slipstream, and inherent structural integrity.<br/><br/>The attention to detail is unprecedented.

The Red Baron's infamous Jasta 11 Squadron is yours to command against the Royal Flying Corps, including the formidable 56th Squadron and British ace Albert Ball. The Allied ground offensive is intensifying. Vimy Ridge has fallen and Douai airbase will follow unless you can turn the tables and match Manfred von Richthofen's success.<br/><br/>The Battle of Cambrai. The German defense is collapsing under the weight of Allied forces. Hundreds of tanks and troops are closing in on Cambrai, and squadrons of Royal Flying Corps are about to turn up the heat. Prove your worth as a Jasta commander: cover your ground forces' retreat, help neutralize the massive assault and initiate counter-attack.<br/><br/>Hat-In-The-Ring. The US Expeditionary force has unleashed its new aerial pursuit squadrons. Now it's your chance to emulate ace Eddie Rickenbacker's skills and kills.

U.S. factories worked relentlessly from '40 to '45 to turn out more than 250,000 planes for battle in the Pacific and Europe. Many were outdated when the war began, but held their own against superior craft until faster, more maneuverable planes arrived. Training consisted of little more than a manual, mission papers and a parachute. We were not ready for war.<br/><br/>Korea<br/><br/>The Korean War lasted from June, 1950 to July, 1953. This international military action involved the U.N., the U.S., and 19 other nations battling over Communism. Air power played a key role in the war; the very first jet-to-jet encounter occurred November 9, 1950 when an American F-80 destroyed a Communist jet fighter. MiG Alley alone resulted in the downing of an estimated 800 MiG fighters and some 58 F-86 Sabre jets.

To do this, you must catch the blobs that fall from the top of your sceen at varying speeds and rhythms. To catch a blob use your finger to move the vertical selection bar from left to right. If your blob hits the ground when the bar is in another lane, you won&rsquo;t earn any points. If the bar is in the correct lane, however, the point will be yours. Accumulate several points in a row to nail down some bonus points and see your final score increase dramatically.<br/><br/>Memory Mode<br/><br/>FireBlob&rsquo;s memory mode puts your neurons to work, letting your reflexes take a rest. Your objective is to reproduce the blobs&rsquo; descent in the order in which they fall.
