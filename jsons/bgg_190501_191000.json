Players must decide whether to try to build their hands to a size that might deliver a decisive blow or to use their cards to gradually wear down their opponent. And the play of cards complements the management of resource including supply, artillery, men and even honour.

Put on the zany, vision-altering google eye glasses and start to draw while your team tries to guess what you're drawing. Is that an igloo or a turtle? A birthday cake or a fortress? Players take turns drawing and guessing, so everyone gets a chance to wear the glasses. The glasses come with three sets of lenses that range from mild changes to mind-blowing fun, so no one can see (or draw) straight--your vision will bounce off of the lenses. Googly Eyes is a fun twist on classic drawing games that lets players of different ages and skill levels compete on equal terms, since the goggles make it fun and challenging for everyone. Unlike any other drawing game you don't need to be an artist, and the rules are simple. Just roll the die and move--the space you land on tells you which color lenses to use (easy, medium, or hard). Then pick a card, set the timer, and start drawing. If your team guesses correctly you get to roll and move again; if not, then you stay where you are on the board. The first team to reach Finish wins.<br/><br/>"}, "190615": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Steam: Rails To Riches", "videogamemode": {"2621": "AI Only"}, "videogameversion": {"348106": "Android Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2949996.png", "videogametheme": {"2511": "Business / Construction"}, "usersrated": "8", "average": "8.5", "videogamegenre": {"2156": "Simulation"}, "videogameplatform": {"6063": "Android"}, "videogamehonor": {"34514": "2015 Golden Geek Best Board Game App Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2949996_t.png", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Build tracks, upgrade towns, improve your train, and sell goods in an attempt to be profitable.<br/><br/>"}, "190616": {"poll": {}, "name": "R\u00f6da Tr\u00e5den", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2014": "Betting/Wagering"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "9", "boardgamefamily": {"35114": "R\u00f6da Tr\u00e5den"}, "average": "3.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6640": {"name": "Nicotext"}}, "boardgameversion": {"295428": "Swedish first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1027": {"name": "Trivia"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "R&ouml;da Tr&aring;den is a quizgame.

Some monsters don't just prey on society from without, but have burrowed and wormed their way into the very heart of the civilized world, and twist and corrupt the very laws that are supposed to protect the innocent, using them to oppress and exploit them, instead. These evils are no less a threat than the ones that most adventurers face, but many PCs are ill-equipped to deal with them. This is a job for rebels.<br/><br/>This book presents five new rebellious archetypes for five different classes. Included are the feral rebel, a hunter archetype whose animal companion can change shape, and who specializes in infiltration and sabotage, the bloody sickle, a medium spirit devoted to revolution and casting down the aristocracy, the guerilla agent, a ranger archetype that specializes in hit-and-run tactics and develops a taste for fighting certain organizations, the partisan, a skald archetype that focuses in winning over the hearts and minds of the public, by any means necessary, and finally the divine liberator, a warpriest archetype devoted to freedom in all its forms, who tears down symbols of oppression, lights the way of freedom, and inspires her allies to great deeds.<br/><br/>Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as the official Paizo adventure path focusing on revolution), or you just want a selection of exciting new abilities for passionate and freedom-loving PCs, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for rebellious villains as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.<br/><br/>"}, "190688": {"rpgitemversion": {"295536": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Needle of Patti", "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2816620.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgsetting": {"25107": "Filbar"}, "rpgproducer": {"74343": "Frank Schmidt"}, "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"13236": "AD&D First Edition (1e) Compatible Products"}, "average": "0", "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"24828": "Adventures in Filbar"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2816620_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>While doing due diligence going over some dusty tomes you have discovered a scrap giving you a clue about some magical items in a strange obelisk somewhere in the vicinity.

This goal is achieved through the game&rsquo;s quick to learn, tactile mechanics and the ease of roleplaying within the game's fiction.<br/>In contrast with most role-playing games, the characters that the players control in Trials of the Magi are direct representations of themselves known as Personas. These imagined characters look, act and talk just as the player would, making it easy for some one new to the hobby to step into their first game.<br/><br/>How the game is played:<br/><br/>The Candidates construct their personas by choosing 3 cards from the four possible Tarot suits of Swords, Wands, Cups or Coins. Then by answering a suit specific question they determine the source of the cards power, and write it on the card. This written word shapes the narrative capabilities of each card, as it represents what form of magic the Persona has access to within the mental landscapes of the trials.<br/>Each Tarot suit represents a type of playstyle, and by picking a combination of 3 cards, you tailor your gameplaying interactions effectively create your own custom &ldquo;character class&rdquo;.<br/><br/>This hand of cards comprises the entirety of each player&rsquo;s Persona, and gameplay revolves around each player&rsquo;s ability to effectively manage how their cards cycle between the three positions of, in their hand, on the table, or discarded.

Of course, this is a risk if the outlaws consider you dangerous.<br/><br/>Unlike the werewolves, the outlaws can have a special character too. The priest, or even the hero, can be an outlaw. This makes the paranoia even bigger: when the cowboys decide to hang a person, why does the judge decide to let him free? Why doesn't the doctor heal the priest after being shot? This make the game much more intriguing. No more &quot;hey i'm a special character i'm innocent&quot;...<br/><br/>Another difference is that you can play the game with lesser persons.

Each player leads his empires to Glory through conquest, trade, science, religion, wealth, culture and many other means. The player with most Glory at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>History of Civilizations differs from most other civilization board games as each player controls several civilizations at once. The game is divided into 5 Ages and takes place on a map spanning the entire world. Each round, players will take turns playing cards from their hand to build cities and wonders, move units, adopt religions, gain powerful leaders, trade with other empires, produce new units and many other things. Each card also depicts an empire that can be started if the game has reached a certain age and an event. Events can be played to affect the game in many ways; everything from natural disasters, generals, spies, revolts, golden ages and usurpers is included in the game.<br/><br/>Each empire has an individual set of Glory conditions that define what that particular empire must achieve in order to earn Glory points (victory points). For example, the Mongols want to be the largest empire in the world and conquer other empires, whereas England wants to have the most colonies and the largest navy. At the end of each round, all empires in play gain Glory according to their empire card. If an empire is performing poorly, it can simply be discarded to free up that empire slot, allowing you to play another empire later. This way, new and more modern empires keep coming into play as the game progresses.<br/><br/>History of Civilizations has many small and simple parts that make up a complex and highly dynamical game, where no two games will play out the same way. Imagine western history without the Romans and Greeks. What if the Aztecs and Incas held out against the Spanish conquistadors?

It marked the first time in 120 years, since the Civil War, that Americans took up arms against each other.<br/><br/>The circumstances were desperate. The United States had been struck by nuclear weapons. Many cities&mdash;Washington, D.C., New York, Los Angeles and others&mdash;had been annihilated, but none in Texas. Texas stood strong. Initially, Governor White of Texas sent convoys of relief supplies to the imperiled areas of the country, but soon learned that the convoys had been intercepted by a skilled and tactful, but unknown, enemy. President Saunders, upset that Texas would withhold aid to the rest of the country, sent military forces to Texas to intimidate its single-minded Governor in to resuming the flow of aid. Governor White responded by sending the Texas National Guard to the border, to meet and stop them.<br/><br/>As these unnatural enemies fought against one another, like brother against brother, a new threat loomed. Both Texas and the United States itself needed to confront the post-nuclear world. They could do it independently or together.<br/><br/>The Texan War of Independence contains four gripping scenarios. Forty new counters bring four formations of Texans to the front lines. The fearless Texans ride toward all enemies in Abrams and M60-A3 tanks, and their well-armed infantry are highly mobile, with plenty of M-113s and Dragon support weapons at hand. Texas had once been its own republic.

Chess clocks are used in chess and other two-player games where the players move in turn. The purpose is to keep track of the total time each player takes for his or her own moves, and ensure that neither player overly delays the game.<br/><br/>Chess clocks were first used extensively in tournament chess, and are often called game clocks. In a tournament, the arbiter typically places all clocks in the same orientation, so that he can easily assess games that need attention at later stages. Their use has since spread to tournament Scrabble, shogi, go, and nearly every competitive two-player board game, as well as other types of games. The first time that game clocks were used in a chess tournament was in the London 1883 tournament.<br/><br/>The simplest time control is &quot;sudden death&quot;, in which players must make a predetermined number of moves in a certain amount of time or forfeit the game immediately. A particularly popular variant in informal play is blitz chess, in which each player is given a short time (e.g. five minutes) on the clock in which to play the entire game.<br/><br/>The players may take more or less time over any individual move. The opening moves in chess are often played quickly due to their familiarity, which leaves the players more time to consider more complex and unfamiliar positions later. It is not unusual in slow chess games for a player to leave the table, but the clock of the absent player continues to run if it is his turn, or starts to run if his opponent makes a move.<br/><br/>", "usersrated": "2", "average": "7.5", "boardgameaccessory": {"171": "Chess"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic165177_t.jpg", "name": "Chess Clock"}, "190859": {"poll": {}, "name": "Frozen: Auf zum Eispalast!", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": {"5597": "Celebrities: Walt Disney"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2823041_t.jpg", "average": "5.525", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"34": {"name": "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2823041.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"295791": "Ravensburger 2014 Multilingual edition"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "Publisher's description: In this exciting dice game, you go on a thrilling journey through Arendelle and make your way to Elsa's Ice Palace with all your favorite Frozen characters!

Once that dreadful mound of muddy earth and stone had risen from the murky waters of a foul and deadly marsh, its inhabitants spreading terror throughout the surrounding lands. The Lizard King is gone now, slain by brave adventurers a decade ago. The murky waters have receded, leaving the tunnel-riddled edifice of evil to tower over a barren, lifeless land. Some claim the mound is empty. Others believe that creatures still creep through the darkened tunnels, waiting to prey on unsuspecting travelers. Then there are the rumors of hidden treasure, strange lights and sounds and signs that the cold-blooded creatures that once gathered there have returned. Are you brave enough, skilled enough, to discover what lurks within the Mound of the Reptile God?<br/><br/>Into the Mound of the Reptile God is the first in a new series of adventures from New Realms Publishing. Hinted at in previous adventures, including Tombs of Terror and The Tomb of Mergal Thar, Into the Mound of the Reptile God begins to unveil a dark and deadly plot that has been developing behind the scenes for many adventures. The adventure takes the characters into the depths of the infamous Mound of the Lizard King. But beware, for who knows what now lurks within the abandoned lizardman lair. And what of the rumors that the reptile men are returning? Delve into the dark depths, battle the deadly inhabitants, overcome the dangerous traps and seek the lost treasures of The Mound of the Reptile God.<br/><br/>The Adventure Module includes a new Adventure Record, 9 Adventure cards, 9 Encounter cards, 9 Event cards, 9 Search cards and 18 Treasure cards.

We here at The Flying Pincushion believe that the core NPC Classes need some pizzaz. Something to make them more appealing, not necessarily so strong as to compete with full classes, but for that step in between a full class and the generic Adept, Aristocrat, Commoner, Expert and Warrior.<br/><br/>In creating this book we drew upon medieval jobs and fantasy archetypes, the sort that exist just outside of the scope of full player characters (who are true archetypes of a skillset). We then tempered the NPC classes into things that we think will give GMs a reason to flesh out an NPC at this sub-core class power level. Finally we discussed whether we thought that in a low powered campaign setting whether we&rsquo;d want to play any of these classes ourselves - and decided that&rsquo;s a yes.<br/><br/>We suggest using these NPC classes are great pre-made characters for a one shot game, or as a way of having your players flesh out areas of your campaign setting with their exploits. Some of these classes make for great villains with odd powers and skills that the players won&rsquo;t be expecting.<br/><br/>We start with the boxman is an archetype for the expert who specializes in all things related to locks, not quite like the more balanced rogue but an absolute genius within his field. The farm soldier is a warrior archetype, a militia man who uses farm equipment to defend his home in times of trouble and growing stronger with the loss of those close to him. The forester is a commoner archetype, commonly found in the employ of landed nobility and tending to tracks of wild land and deterring poachers. The hostler is a commoner archetype and specializes in the training of animals. The master craftsman is an expert archetype and fills the role of the specialist craftsman. The minstrel is an expert archetype as well and plays second fiddle to the bard - offering supporting acts and benefits for those more proficient in the limelight. The nun is an adept archetype who offers sage teaching to those working on a difficult skill and highly proficient with healing. The coven sworn is an aristocrat archetype who fills the role of the kidnapped noble raised by witches to be their puppet. The deep jungle flesh-hunter is a warrior archetype, a cannibal wildman skilled with poisons and ambush. The deep jungle shaman of the flesh is an adept archetype who gains mystic power from consuming the heart and brains of slain foe. The noble wastrel is an aristocrat archetype of a decadent noble who grows more charismatic the more intoxicated he is. The caller is an adept archetype and could be described as a golemancer, someone who breathes life into inert elements and animates them either to help their community or as a villainous figure. The siege sapper is a warrior archetype, a commander of warmachine and siege tactics vital to any army. The tax assessor is an aristocrat archetype, a tax collector who always gets their dues. The urchin is a commoner archetype and what every orphaned rogue was at one point, rabble taking advantage of large crowds and quick hands, hoping to get noticed and recruited by a thieves guild. The way trader is an expert alternate class, and is the master merchant, skilled at sneaking in blackmarket goods and getting the best deal. The vicar; an archetype for the adept who inspires others.<br/><br/>"}, "190875": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Lords of Undeath", "rpgproducer": {"38431": "Louis Porter, Jr. Design Studio"}, "usersrated": "0", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2820900.jpg", "rpgitemversion": {"295820": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"10437": "Obsidian Apocalypse"}, "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"23595": "Adventure Path Iconics"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2820900_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>A dark star fell from the sky bringing with it the end of all things!

It&rsquo;s pages hold information on the medic, a mundane healer who can patch up friendlies and keep them moving until more permanent doctoring can be had. Not only that but these medics can mitigate the effects of diseases, or even some curses and the lingering effects of death. Don&rsquo;t think they just sit on the sideline however the medic is also a competent melee combatant ready to hang out on the front lines. But when it comes to the darker side of war, none push through more than the shadowknight, a dark avenger, the shadowy fist of an ideal. They are not fair, but of what use is fairness in war? Also included is the legend wielder and his legendary weapon. These are the weapons of which songs are sung, and entire battles shift when someone unsheathes an item of its magnitude. The brother of the vulture stands ready to sanctify the dead and to destroy any undead that may stand before him.<br/><br/>What good would a manuscript of war be without some strategic insights? Presenting a new feat type, strategy feats. A party tactician can extend a benefit to all allies near to him, and with each new strategy comes more vision into brilliant maneuvers which can be accomplished.<br/><br/>Included:<br/><br/>     New classes and options to make the most out of any warring setting.<br/>     2 New Base Classes the Medic and the Shadowknight<br/>     2 Prestige Classes the Brother of the Vulture, and the Legend Wielder<br/>     New &ldquo;Strategy Feats&rdquo; and the Strategist Cavalier Archetype.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"}, "190913": {"poll": {}, "name": "Trivial Pursuit Family Edition Featuring the Magic of Disney", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "1986", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "24", "boardgamefamily": {"101": "Trivial Pursuit"}, "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"328": {"name": "Horn Abbot Ltd."}}, "boardgameversion": {"295868": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Trivial Pursuit Featuring the Magic of Disney Family Edition Master Game from Parker Brothers and Horn Abbott.

Each mission provides the players a currency reward giving them more bidding power and bringing them closer to victory. Robots will need to work with and against one another to become the ultimate BetaBot worthy of entering Robotopia.<br/><br/>BetaBotz takes minimal time to learn but includes enough variation in content and strategy that no two games are the same. The simultaneous mission feature of BetaBotz allows all players to participate during missions. There is a high level of engagement and interaction between the players so that everyone can have a blast through the entirety of game play!<br/><br/>Players start BetaBotz with 40 bitz (currency) and use this starting pool to bid on a robot body with stats in four attributes (Agility, Firepower, Structure and Processor). Throughout the game players use their remaining bitz and any bit rewards received to bid against one another on components that increase their attributes or select single use &quot;Code Cards&quot; in an effort to complete missions. In addition to components increasing a robot's ability to complete missions, achieving a stat of 13 or more in an attribute activates a power associated with that attribute.<br/><br/>A complete game of BetaBotz is played over the course of ten missions. Mission cards of different tiers are selected based on the number of players. Missions require at least a specific value in one (or multiple) of the four attributes to complete. All players attempt to complete the current mission simultaneously and those that are successful receive a reward of bitz. Players are able to form teams to complete the current mission but they must split the mission rewards among the team. At the conclusion of the 10th mission the player with the highest individual attribute, the most gold components and code cards each receive an additional bitz reward. The player with the most bitz at the end of the game, including the bonus bitz, is the winner.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"295873": "English edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "BetaBotz", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2012": "Auction/Bidding"}, "average": "7.62", "usersrated": "50", "boardgamefamily": {"22184": "Admin: Unreleased Games"}}, "190916": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Arcane - The Stone Circle: Episode 1", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"295877": "Web Browser edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2824454.jpg", "videogameseries": {"32950": "Arcane, The Online Mystery Serial"}, "videogametheme": {"2355": "Detective / Mystery"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5231": "Cthulhu Mythos"}, "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"5084": "Web Browser"}, "usersrated": "0", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2824454_t.jpg", "description": "In the mid-1920's, three investigators track the strange actions of a secret society plotting the return to Earth of a powerful ancient occult extra-terrestrial entity.

Normally, you would throw some dice and calculate the sum of the numbers being shown. In this game, you calculate the sum of the numbers NOT being shown. Such a roll is called an inverted dice roll and is made with standard six-sided dice. You need five dice to play.<br/> The structure of the game is a bit like the one in Yahtzee, with a similar score chart and three rolls (or fewer) per turn.<br/> There are twenty rounds in the game. In each round, players take turns rolling five dice (inverted), trying to reach one of the numbers from 1 to 20 (it has to be a number that the player has not previously achieved or zeroed out).<br/> After each inverted dice roll, the player chooses which dice to keep, and which to reroll. A player may reroll some or all of the dice up to two times on a turn, making a maximum of three rolls each turn.<br/> If a player achieves an available result, it is registered in the score chart.<br/> If the player fails (after three rolls), a number must be recorded as zero points.<br/> Every player must put either a score or a zero into a score box each turn.<br/> The game ends when all score boxes are used.
