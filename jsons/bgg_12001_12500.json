The Board has NORMAL prices printed thereon. A removable panel, which fits over two pegs in the center of the board, has BOOM prices and rents on the obverse and BUST prices and rents on the reverse. The game starts in NORMAL cycle, changes to BOOM cycle, then to BUST cycle, then back to NORMAL, etc., when any player lands on any of the three corner spaces marked with a Star. (The fourth corner is &quot;Start Here.&quot;) Players try to increase their worth by buying properties at BUST or NORMAL prices, and selling properties at BOOM prices, while trying to bankrupt their opponents by collecting rents, the highest of which is $250,000. The standard rule concerning landing on Un-owned Property is &quot;buy it or leave it.&quot; There is an AUCTION option in the Rules, similar to the Auction Rule in Monopoly.<br/>This game plays like a simplified version of its more famous stable mate, Monopoly, but with the unique twist that all properties' values increase or decrease at the same time, sometimes in rapid succession, without having to develop the properties or have groups or sets.<br/><br/>The raised playing field (Board) actually sits in the 15&quot;x15&quot;x2&quot; box bottom (it is not designed to stand alone).

These riches are represented in the game by shiny gold counters which look very much like wide, flat gold bars. Only gold returned to one's port counts for victory.<br/><br/>The sailing ship's hulls are printed on cardboard sheets, to be punched out and folded into shape. Three wooden dowel masts are inserted through punched-out, printed paper sails and then through the decks of the ships.<br/><br/>The board is a blank diagonal grid of 32 square ocean spaces with the four players' home ports in the corners. The 29 Sea Square tiles are shuffled and 32 of them placed face down on the spaces. There are four each of Island, Reef, Ship and Monster tiles plus the Cipangu tile, a Fog tile, and a Storm tile. All others are open sea.<br/><br/>There are four Encounter Decks, cards from which are drawn when a ship discovers Islands, Reefs, Ships, and Monsters. The monsters are the only fantasy element of the game. Their artwork is drawn in the style of the &quot;Here There Be Monsters&quot; of the old mapmakers. Each deck has cards with good or bad results: gold bars, extra sailors, repairs, attacks by monsters or pirates, grounding on reefs, being attacked or helped by island natives, etc.<br/><br/>Each ship starts with three sailors and three masts. The markers for the sailors are actually the familiar plastic push-pins available in any dollar store, without the pin. Both sailors and masts serve as 'hit-point' indicators: any ship that loses all masts or all sailors is sunk. Movement range is determined by current no. of masts to a maximum of 3 spaces.<br/><br/>There is a wind direction spinner which is a 'top' made up of an octagonal direction card with a wood dowel through the center. This is spun to determine which direction a player's ship cannot sail that turn.<br/><br/>Players move around the board, turning over the sea tiles and trying to accumulate gold and survive the various events that can damage their ship. When the one Cipangu tile is discovered, players can get 3 gold bars each turn they stay there.<br/><br/>Players can also 'Turn Pirate' by attacking another player's ship or port. 1d6's are rolled and compared, low roller in each round loses one sailor, ties cause both ships to lose a mast. Ships that lose all sailors are plundered of their gold and sunk. Ships that lose all masts just sink.<br/>  Combat against ports is handled the same way except ports have no masts. Players can leave extra sailors in port as defense forces. Sunk ships are replaced, and damaged ships repaired, by paying one gold bar and continuing with a new/fixed 3-mast, 3-sailor ship from your port.<br/><br/>Once the last Sea Tile is turned over, the game ends and Gold Bars are counted up to determine a victor.<br/><br/>"}, "12330": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic183662.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1994", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "0", "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic183662_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Children's Game", "Educational", "Memory", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "description": "Create your own Lion King scenes!

Kennedy<br/><br/>In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.<br/><br/>Components (original edition):<br/><br/><br/>     228 full colour counters <br/>     22&quot;x34&quot; full colour map <br/>     103 event cards <br/>     2 six-sided dice<br/>     1 24-page rulebook<br/>     2 full colour player aid cards<br/><br/><br/>Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)<br/><br/>     260 full colour counters <br/>     22&quot;x34&quot; mounted map with revised graphics<br/>     110 event cards<br/>     2 six-sided dice<br/>     1 24-page rulebook<br/>     2 full colour player aid cards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system<br/>UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta &amp; Jason Matthews<br/>MAP, CARD, &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch<br/><br/><br/>A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:<br/><br/>     Mounted map with revised graphics<br/>     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters<br/>     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)<br/>     Revised rules and player aid cards<br/>     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:<br/><br/>     Mounted Map with revised graphics<br/>     New card decks<br/>     Updated Rules &amp; Charts<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Brazilian first edition", "Chinese edition", "Czech first edition", "English Collector's Edition", "English Deluxe edition (Sixth Printing)", "English Deluxe edition 2009", "English Deluxe edition 2011", "English Deluxe edition 2012", "English Deluxe edition 2014", "English Deluxe Edition 2015", "English first edition", "English first edition, Second Printing", "English first edition, Third Printing", "French first edition", "French second edition", "German Deluxe edition", "German Second Deluxe edition", "German Third Deluxe Edition", "Hungarian Edition", "Italian Deluxe Edition", "Japanese edition", "Korean first edition", "Polish deluxe first edition", "Polish First edition", "Polish fourth edition", "Polish second edition", "Polish third edition", "Spanish first edition 2012", "Spanish second edition"], "average": "8.35811", "name": "Twilight Struggle", "videogamebg": ["Twilight Struggle"], "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "13", "boardgameexpansion": ["224686", "117145", "151546", "123262", "190581", "199869", "163247"], "usersrated": "27300", "boardgameaccessory": ["Twilight Struggle: Deluxe Countersheet", "Twilight Struggle: Deluxe Mounted Mapboard"], "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games", "Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Russia", "Country: USA"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["25 \u2013 The Family Gamers Podcast \u2013 Solo play", "6.

A brand new class of ship--the light cruiser--makes its debut in <br/>D&amp;B.  Over 40 CL are included, along with new optional rules for their use.   Besides these light cruisers, additional ships from Argentina, Australia, Austria-Hungary, Brazil, Britain, France, Germany,Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Turkey, and the United States are included in D&amp;B.<br/> What's Included:  24 page rulebook, ten 8.5&quot;x11&quot; cardstock counter sheets (345 ships plus 25 blanks), game markers and templates, and a small color sheet of counters.  D&amp;B components must be mounted and cut apart prior to play. New optional rules include Light Cruisers, Modified CA Gun Range, Rough Sea option, Battlecruiser Vulnerability rule, Low Ammunition rule, and a new optional method for determining victory<br/>points.

It contained 18 Greatest Holes and came with 32 well known golfers.   The 18 Greatest Holes publsihed in the 1962 edition contain 4 different holes than later versions of the 18 Greatest Holes.<br/><br/>As the Golfer card sets ran out of production APBA publshed new sets to replace the out of production sets.   This led to the creation of a:<br/><br/>1962/64 set, 1972, 1976, 1978, 1981, 1985 and an All Time Greats Set.   Sports Game Publishing and the APBA Journal also published a number of golf sets in later years as well.<br/><br/>8 Courses were published by APBA officially (Two Versions of the 18 Greatest Holes).   The now defunct Sports Game Publishing company also published at least 3 more courses for the game adding: Sawgrass, Winged Foot, St. Andrews and Oakmont to the list.  The format for these course were 3 to a page on 11 x 17 paper and then changed to 8 1/2 x 11 with one course per page.<br/><br/>ASG Golf (George Gerney | <a target='_blank' href='http://www.asggames.com' rel='nofollow'>www.asggames.com</a>) has gone on to publish courses for: Bethpage Black, Pinehurst No 2., Augusta National, Pebble Beach, TPC Scottsdale, St. Andrews, TPC Sawgrass and Bay Hill.<br/><br/>From the APBA Journal: An Eighth APBA Golf Course (For Holes 3,4,5,6 of the greatest hits)<br/><br/>&quot;While preparing the Golf Archives Reference Pack (now available from the AJ office). I encountered a letter to the editor in the August 15, 1971, issue of APBA Innings. (Back in those practically prehistoric days, the AJ covered only baseball, leaving APBA's other sports to its competition, AI.)<br/><br/>The letter, by Doug Bauer, notes that the original APBA golf course, the 18 Greatest Holes compilation, had changed between the game's original appearance in the mid-1960's and 1971.<br/><br/>In the original course, holes 3,4,5 and 6 all came from courses in Southem California. Number three was the fourth hole at Riviera Country Club, Los Angeles. a par three. Number four was the eighth hole from Lakeside Golf Course in Hollywood, a par four. APBA's fifth hole was the third at Vaney Club in Santa Barbara, a par four. And number six was the 14th at Los Angeles' Bel Air Country Club, a par five.<br/><br/>In the later version, number three is the 13th hole at Congressional Country Club in Washington, D.C., a par four. APBA's fourth hole is the 14th at Brookline (Mass.) Country Club, a par five. Number five is the eighth hole at Westchester Country Club, Harrison, N. Y., a par four. And number six is the third hole at Akron's Firestone Country Club, also a par four.<br/><br/>As a consequence of these changes, par is 71 in the later course but just 70 in the original version.<br/><br/>So it turns out that there are, In effect, eight APBA golf courses rather than the seven we knew about:Augusta (1964), Merion (1975), Pebble Beach (1976), Firestone (1976), Pinehurst (1977), Pine Valley (1977) and two versions of the 18 Great Holes (1964 and c.1970).&quot;<br/><br/>Sports Game Publishing was a company that published expansions for APBA products, they maintained a web presense from 2002 thru 2006.  During that time they produced a number of products for APBA Golf.<br/><br/>The main product that they published was Doctor Clines Advanced Rules for APBA Golf<br/><br/>St. Vincent College (Latrobe, PA) Golf Coach Dr. Thomas Cline's APBA golf innovations and upgrades have been published many times in the APBA Journal, and gamers have acknowledged the accuracy and realism his work has added. Recently Dr. Cline started from scratch and carefully dissected the game with a mathematical precision not possible when the game was developed. The result is a game completely compatible with the golf courses and cards you currently own, while allowing you to play a modern golf bag and manage holes the way today&rsquo;s pros do.<br/><br/>Golfers will drive the ball, hit fairways, and putt the way they do in real life. You can finally choose from the clubs the players really carry; no more 2-wood that today&rsquo;s players never use. Instead, choose a 4-wood, 5-wood, and/or 1-iron&mdash;just like the pros of today! If you have always wanted wind, course conditions, lie conditions, and each golfer&rsquo;s ability to &ldquo;work the ball&rdquo; to have the same influence on your course that they have in the real game, now they can!<br/><br/>Dr. Cline&rsquo;s new Master Game elements are individually implemented, so you can add some of them, all of them, or none at all, and still achieve a level of golf accuracy never before possible. Combined with charts that finally are capable of reproducing the abilities of golfers of the 21st century, this fantastic new game will allow you to use the golf courses and golf cards you already own with accurate results, while integrating future cards and courses as well.<br/><br/>The new &ldquo;boards&rdquo; are actually a spiral-bound, 8&frac12; x 11-inch booklet, printed on card stock for durability, that contains complete playing instructions and play charts for both the Basic and Master games. The game box also includes all the components you need to play: dice, shaker, ball markers, and score sheets designed for use with both the Basic and Master games, along with nine sample golfers and a sample golf hole.<br/><br/>APBA has announced that they plan on re-publishing APBA Golf in 2010.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "1", "boardgameversion": ["APBA First Edition"], "name": "APBA Professional Golf", "playingtime": "120", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling"], "average": "6.60484", "boardgameexpansion": ["57268", "57262", "57266", "57271", "57269", "57257"], "usersrated": "31", "boardgamefamily": ["Sports: Golf"]}, "12370": {"boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "poll": [], "name": "Maya Code", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Partnerships", "Tile Placement"], "yearpublished": "1984", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic50695_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Creanet"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic50695.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Conquer the sun platform with wits and logic and occupy it with the code of your own tribal colors.

The German, changing their initial Schlieffen Plan, attacked through the gap between Paris and the Allied left wing, further to the east. Their intent was to destroy the Allied armies in one grand battle of annihilation. But the plan went awry. The Germans had outrun their lines of communication, and it was difficult for them to replace their losses while the Allies, with their ever shortening lines of communication, quickly regained strength.

I'm not certain where to begin describing this one, so let me give an overview and a look at the components.<br/><br/>The game board is styled after the traditional Monopoly board as a square with properties down each of the sides and special areas on the corners--in this case the corners are *J.C. Nichols Parkway* Start &gt;, Tax Audit &laquo;Pay&raquo;, &deg;Stock Market: Collect&deg;, and *Uninsurable Loss*.  Unlike the traditional Monopoly board, there are no squares that are not properties (e.g. no Chance, Community Chest) Additionally, the properties are not grouped in colors.  All of the properties are representative of Plaza businesses at the time of printing.<br/><br/>The six player pieces are small, colored, enameled, metal, horse-drawn carriages, like the type that they use for carriage rides down on The Plaza.  Additionally, there is money in denominations of $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, and $100,000.  There is a spinner with the numbers 1,000 to 12,000.  There is also a deck of action cards with various things like &quot;Option to buy  - spin dial, pay  amount on dial&quot;, &quot;Stock Market Falls - Pay $10,000 to bank, don't move, resume play&quot;, and the enigmatic &quot;Two Spaces&quot;.<br/><br/>...and that's it; no instructions, no dice, no property deeds or property values.  I'm stumped as to whether this was actually a game, or if this was a game prototype that never made it to fruition.  The cardboard insert inside the box has no markings on it, there is nothing on the inside of the lid, and the box itself is completely blank and made to look like a nice leather briefcase (albeit made of cardboard) and has no information on it, not even the game's name--the name only appears on the board.

THE DEVIL'S TO PAY explores a little known, but quite plausible, alternate chain of events turning on one such small incident.<br/><br/>Longstreet's scout Harrison ends up swinging from an apple tree, festooned with one of John Buford's famous 'let him hang for 7 days' notes. Bereft of the knowledge that the AoP is NORTH of the Potomac and hot in pursuit, General Lee simply continues as before for a few days longer, with his 3 Corps following the orders that he had already historically given them. Ewell attacks the Harrisburg defenses, which fall after a day or so. The bridges are burned, but with the shallow water and fords, the city itself is taken a couple of days later (helped by Jenkins' taking of the Rockville RR bridge to the north). However, the Pa Reserves (Crawford's Division) have been rushed north from the Washington defenses, and with their help Couch has drawn a defensive line along the Swatara Creek, a few miles to the east of Harrisburg. Early moves north from York along the Harrisburg Pike, which follows the river from York Haven. Hill, and then Longstreet follow Ewell down the Cumberland Valley (to the NE) towards the Pennsylvania capitol. By July 2nd, the Confederate Army is badly strung out; Ewell has two of his Divisions (Rodes &amp; Johnson) across the Susquehanna, with the third (Early) holding the West Shore. Hill is a couple of miles west in Mechanicsburg/Shiremanstown with Anderson's Division, while Heth and Pender's Divisions are ranged to the south holding the wide 'gap' at Dillsburg. Longstreet has two Divisions in Carlisle (Hood's &amp; McLaw's), while Pickett is still a few miles to the west guarding the ever-lengthening supply line running south to Virginia. Jenkins' coup de main has resulted in the immense Union supply base at Harrisburg being captured almost intact, and every wagon that makes it west over the shallow ford means another day of supplies for the ANVA in the fall and winter to come.<br/><br/>With the Confederates now further to the north, the AoP continues to move forward on the Gettysburg/Hanover/Manchester line it had reached by June 30th. By the evening of July 2nd, Buford's Cavalry is skirmishing with Heth's troops in the Franklintown area. Reynolds has passed Petersburg (York Springs) and is moving forward with the I &amp; XI Corps, with Sickles' III Corps and Merritt's Reserve cavalry Brigade in position to threaten the Mt. Holly Gap a few miles to the west, on the direct route between Gettysburg and Carlisle. Spurred on by the fall of Harrisburg, the rest of the Army of the Potomac is steadily marching north as well, it's concentration greatly aided by the convergence of all the main roads north at Dillsburg. The Union intelligence arm has been working overtime, and General Meade has been handed an opportunity bigger than that which faced McClellan at Frederick nearly a year before. The Confederate Army is stretched over 20 miles, from west of Carlisle to east of the Susquehanna; if he can get the Army of the Potomac through the gap at Dillsburg in force before Lee can concentrate, he will split the ANVA in two with a good chance of cutting the bulk of it off, 100 miles north of the Potomac.<br/><br/>Stuart has continued to bounce off of the right flank of the marching Union Army, and has finally followed Early over York Mountain and back into contact. Lee now knows the true danger of his position, and hurriedly orders Ewell to get his troops back across the river while the rest of the Army rushes to reinforce the troops holding the vital gap. Apprised of the situation, Couch endeavors to maintain contact, using Crawford's veteran troops to slow Ewell's withdrawal as much as possible.<br/><br/>Essentially, this scenario is very similar to the Battle of South Mountain in '62, except that the 'gap' is far wider and less defensible and the stakes, if anything, are even higher! A desperate defense/attack, coupled with wildly variable reinforcements should make for a game with quite a bit of replay value! The Union player must mount a furious attack with his arriving troops, regardless of casualties, knowing that he has a chance to strike a war-winning blow. The Confederate player must form a desperate, collapsing defense on several fronts, while trying to extricate both Ewell's troops and as many supplies as possible from his foothold on the east shore of the Susquehanna.<br/><br/>THE DEVIL'S TO PAY Contains: <br/><br/>    1 full color 22 x 34 tactical map covering the critical gap at Dillsburg, Pennsylvania. <br/>    2 identical 8 1/2 x 11 Op/Maps covering the battle area, as well as the operational area surrounding it. <br/>    1 8 - 12 page booklet detailing the scenario set-up and conditions, as well as a 'historical' article giving the background leading up to the battle. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You must own Summer Storm: The Battle of Gettysburg to play The Devil's to Pay.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "name": "The Devil's To Pay", "playingtime": "4", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "average": "7.80769", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "13", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "age": "12"}, "12052": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic50066.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Art Lupinacci"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgamepublisher": ["L2 Design Group"], "maxplaytime": "240", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic50066_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "The Russian Campaign Southern Expansion Kit is a collection new and frequently requested variant rules that breath new life into a grand favorite game that has stood the test of time.<br/><br/>The kit includes a 13&rdquo;*30&rdquo; map extension that carries the original game by John Edwards into the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia.

Wells (the famous historian and science fiction writer) was a pacifist, and the book makes for interesting reading, as wargaming was his favorite hobby.  He considered the generals he played with to be reckless buffoons, and was worried for his country should war break out.  (WWI broke out the year after the book was published, and given the massive casualties of WWI, he seems justified in his opinions.)<br/><br/>The rules themselves are fairly simple, as miniatures games go.  There are rules for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, terrain setup, prisoners, etc.  There are three types of units: cavalry, infantry and artillery.  The toy soldiers of Wells' day were fairly large, so the movement factors are also large, and it's made to be played on a floor.<br/><br/>Ranged combat results are entertaining, but hard to recreate in today's world.  In Wells' time, toy cannons fired little pellets and were actually tooled to be quite accurate.  The game calls for aiming the cannons and firing them, and any figures you knock over are casualties!  The best recreation I've seen was at a convention where we used toy pistols that fired plastic disks: the player had to place the butt of the pistol on the floor next to his artillery and fire from there.<br/><br/>Melee combat does not use a randomizer.  (In the book Wells discusses how he started with a coin flip but was turned against it when one soldier won over twenty battles!)  Instead, compare sizes of units, add in &quot;supporting&quot; units (within a certain distance), and each side takes casualties proportionately.  The remaining smaller force is then taken prisoner and may be escorted to the rear lines - or freed on the way by a rescue attempt.<br/><br/>Although modern miniatures rules are more complex and realistic, this is still a very fun game to play, and is a big hit at conventions.

The players need to supply miniatures, terrain, dice, etc.  This game is strictly for skirmish wargaming, meaning one figure represents one person.<br/><br/>The game contains rules for miniatures gaming with 17th-century swashbuckling pirates and musketeers, as seen in the movies.  Rules are given for movement, ranged combat,  melee combat, morale, etc.  The most interesting rules are the &quot;cinematic&quot; rules, however.  Figures are defined as either Leading Players, Supporting Actors, Bit Parts or Extras.  A Leading Player can mow through a <b>lot</b> of Extras without even slowing down, but combat between two characters of the same level is tense and more drawn out.<br/><br/>Rules are also given for two types of stunts: Deeds of Derring-Do and Dramatic Entrances.  Very entertaining!<br/><br/>The rules not only deal with figures, but also cover ship-to-ship combat and boarding.  The ship movement system is very simple and completely ignores the wind even though these are sailing ships.<br/><br/>Finally, the game provides two scenarios - &quot;Scripts,&quot; they call it, in keeping with their cinematic theme.  One scenario is for pirates and the other for musketeers.<br/><br/>This is a light, easy, not too detailed set of miniatures rules aimed at fun rather than historical accuracy.  It doesn't require a lot of miniatures to get started - even four figures per side makes for an entertaining game.<br/><br/>[Note: there is a companion volume, Once Upon a Time in the West Country, set in the English Civil War.  Similar rules system, somewhat less cinematic.]<br/><br/>"}, "12069": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Donald F.

It contains his rules for skirmish miniatures gaming.  In skirmish wargaming, each figure represents one man (or woman or animal).  Consequently, they tend to represent small action warfare.<br/><br/>The book has a chapter of basic rules common to all the scenarios, then provides detailed scenarios (even with an entertainingly written fictional account) and special rules for the following eras:<br/><br/>The Vikings (850 AD)<br/>English Archers in France (1429)<br/>English Civil War cavalry action (1643)<br/>Pirates in the Caribbean (1715)<br/>The Peninsular War (1813, Napoleonic)<br/>The French Foreign Legion in Mexico (1866)<br/>British Colonials vs Zulus (1879)<br/>The Old West (1888, USA)<br/>First World War trench raid (1916)<br/>Street fighting in Cassino (1944)<br/><br/>A typical battle will feature 8-12 men per side.  Team play is possible.<br/><br/>The basic system requires a player to issue orders to his troops, such as seize a certain objective.  It may take a few turns for the troops to get there, and in the meantime, the situation may have changed.  It takes a full turn to issue new orders, during which the troops continue towards the old objective!<br/><br/>Rules are given for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, wound levels, troop quality levels, morale, etc.  A record sheet is needed to keep track of these things (plus orders), but due to the small number of troops, it's not a problem.

After every 4 rounds, the effects of the players' actions are asserted on the industry and their profits and losses are tallied.  Depending on the space their token lands on, players can undertake four types of actions.  They can buy an East German operation, getting it for free by impersonating as a former owner (the result of a good dice roll) or outbidding the other players in the resulting auction.  Usually, the followup action is to lay off the workers of these operations (at the expense of the industry) to increase profits.  Players can also increase profits by taking the action to grab the grants for rescuing the ecology of the ravaged industrial lands.  The last action is to negotiate with each other to manipulate the market to their benefits through threats, bargains, and bribes.  During the course of the game, cards are drawn that allow their owners to influence the effects of their actions or to affect their opponents'.<br/><br/>The game ends with the conclusion of the final (16th) round.

The first two rounds are public knowledge: if asked, you must tell how you voted on a given item.  The third round is secret, however.<br/><br/>After three rounds, count up the votes for each character for each item.  There are tie-breaking rules.  High score wins.<br/><br/>During the game you can make deals and break them - this will be no surprise if you've read the comics.  You must record your votes in ink, though!<br/><br/>"}, "12146": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1926723.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Jo\u00e3o Pedro Neto"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2000", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": ["N\u00e9stor Romeral Andr\u00e9s"], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Public Domain)", "nestorgames"], "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1926723_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy"], "description": "From Wikipedia:<br/><br/>Gonnect is a strategy board game for two players invented by Jo&atilde;o Pedro Neto in 2000.<br/><br/>The game is played with standard go equipment (though 13x13 boards are often preferred to 19x19) and all the rules of Go apply, except that players can't pass and the pie rule is used to determine who goes first.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is as in Hex: to construct a group that connects any two opposite sides. A player can also win if his opponent has no legal moves (since suicides and passes are illegal).<br/><br/>Games between skilled players will end up temporarily deadlocked, since the square Go board allows a &quot;four corners&quot; configuration where neither side can strongly connect. However, since players can't pass, they eventually must start filling in the internal liberties of their groups. The player who has made the smallest amount of territory will presumably get killed first, so building more territory than your opponent is a secondary (but extremely common) means of forcing a connection and the win.<br/><br/>So, a gonnect game between similarly skilled opponents unfolds in two stages:<br/><br/><br/>     The board-filling stage where opponents race to connect sides until the position is deadlocked.<br/>     The eye-filling stage where opponents must fill in their own eye space or destroy their opponents. <br/><br/><br/>Although it shares many of the same tactics as go, some players feel that gonnect has a more interesting opening and endgame than Go. Most Go players, however, feel that the eye-filling stage of Gonnect is tedious, and that the game lacks the simple elegance of Go.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.08387", "name": "Gonnect", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Enclosure", "Pattern Building"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "31", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Combinatorial", "Connection Games"]}, "12147": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Larry Zacher"], "poll": [], "name": "Murder Mystery Party: Stayin' Alive", "playingtime": "120", "minplayers": "6", "boardgamemechanic": ["Role Playing"], "yearpublished": "2003", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic49018_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["bePuzzled", "University Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic49018.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["bePuzzled Edition 2002"], "maxplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Deduction", "Murder/Mystery", "Party Game"], "age": "18", "minplaytime": "120", "description": "Get ready to shake your groove thing in trendy Studio Manhattan.

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>Note: The Dutch first edition and German second edition include the first expansion for this game, Munchkin Bites! 2: Pants Macabre.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch first edition", "English first edition", "English first edition, 9th printing", "English second edition (rules/card changes)", "German first edition", "German Halloween edition", "Italian Second Edition", "Russian edition"], "average": "6.05467", "name": "Munchkin Bites!", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Trading", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["106498", "54435", "98956", "38891", "136857", "44805", "88665", "100422", "133928", "133929", "18898", "11058", "126425", "39392", "14580", "134690", "130194", "187049", "226171", "134725", "130826", "134691", "24733", "84870", "62387", "153943", "146658", "146657", "146659", "69436", "176441", "86356", "134692"], "usersrated": "2458", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Party Games", "Thematic Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Munchkin", "Vampires"]}, "12195": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic124871.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Gary Graber"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "2", "age": "12", "boardgamepublisher": ["Minden Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic124871_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Wargame", "World War II"], "description": "Panzerschreck Magazine #12.

Well, the concept of the Ability Chart is still fundamental to the rules - particularly as it cuts down on the need for excessive record keeping.  This time however, there are more dice and they play critical roles.  In the past, if you had a 'bad [dice] throw' then ll your actions were affected.  With Fourth Edition, the dice are color coded, with one being 'common' to all.  The score of this Common dice [die] is added to the dice [die] relating to the various actions.<br/><br/>Other new innovations include the division of a player's part of Turn into two segments and reloading, so that the time scale of actions are more realistic.

Jim Dunnigan, then aged 25 and described in the game's &quot;designer's notes&quot; as a history major in the School of General Studies, had already designed 1914 and was at the time working on Origins of World War II, but was asked to take time out to work on this design.<br/><br/>The game is for two players, Radicals and Administration.  The map features eleven tracks for each of the political subgroups in the game (e.g. Black Students, Moderate Strikers, Alumni, Harlem Community).  The objective for the players is to have the most influence, determined by the positions of markers on these tracks, for their side by the end of the twelfth turn.  During a turn, players deploy abstracted units representing their political leverage onto the tracks to 'attack' the other player's units (as tokens, Dunnigan suggests small pieces of paper colored red or marijuana seeds for the Radicals, and blue bits of paper or capsules of Seconal for the Administration) and so move the markers towards their 'end' of the tracks.

The game uses a large gameboard, comes in our big box and is for 2-5 players. Playing time is 75+ minutes. It is not a simulation game but provides more Alex flavor than Alexandros. Each turn, players move with their armies (wooden) and build cities and temples (both wooden, too).<br/><br/>In this game, players follow the path of Alexander's army, occupying provinces in regions, building temples, founding cities. You score points each round and also at the end of the game for majorities. There are 5 regions, but for the short game you just use #2 to #4.<br/><br/>Players have 15 tiny wood cubes which they distribute each round on a hidden plan in 4 ways. Then they reveal their choices and carry out the actions. This way they decide 1. turn order 2. army size 3. temple building 4. city building. By putting more cubes than others in the sections controls how the round works for you.<br/><br/>So the player with the most cubes in 1. gets to choose their turn order (since going later may be better). Then the cubes in 2. become your army on the board (and having majorities in provinces scores 2 pts). Moving the armies around costs cubes as well, which are taken from 3. and 4. Then, where your soldiers are, you can build temples (3.) or found cities (4.). But if another player is also doing the same, whoever has the most cubes on their plan gets it, but pays 1 more than the second highest.<br/><br/>In this way, players spend their 15 cubes each round, moving from province to province in the region, trying to score points for controlling armies, building temples and cities. Where players directly compete, the costs are high. Where you are unopposed, your unspent cubes carry on to the next round, allowing you to try to get more points.<br/><br/>When the last region is conquered, there is a final scoring, for the majorities of temples and cities in each region and then in the whole game. The scoring switches here, since in the rounds temples earn you 3pts &amp; cities earn 5pts. But at game end, cities earn 10pts and temples earn 15pts.<br/><br/>The game is a mix of planning, bluff, tactics and group think. It works as a contest of majorities and the use of the cubes, in both deciding who goes and what things cost, is clever.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["Dutch Edition", "English Edition", "German edition"], "average": "6.10888", "name": "Alexander the Great", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence"], "age": "10", "usersrated": "480", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Country: Greece"]}, "12249": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Marvin Glass"], "poll": [], "name": "Watch Word", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting"], "yearpublished": "1966", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic536092_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Ideal"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic536092.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Card Game", "Word Game"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Players play with a hand of six cards with four community cards loaded into the card-revealing machine.

It is 1942, Japan is at the height of her expansion into Southeast Asia and the Pacific, yet China stands defiantly unconquerable. As the Japanese player, you must carefully pit the Chinese factions against each other while using your superior military machine to bring all of China under your control. As the Nationalist Chinese player, you must cooperate with the Communists (however distasteful that may seem) to drive the invading Japanese from the shores of China before re-establishing your authority as the only central government of China. As the Chinese Communist player, you too are faced with an enemy worse than fellow Chinese. You must first drive the Japanese from China before you can put your superior guerrilla tactics to work against the corrupt Kuomintang.<br/><br/>Player&rsquo;s Value: This is a simple game with undemanding rules (movement two areas per turn, roll dice in simultaneous rounds of combat, each &ldquo;1&rdquo; is an elimination and each &ldquo;6&rdquo; is a retreat, minor variations on this for leaders, air forces, etc.). It hustles right along at six months per turn, with a variable exit point for the Japanese. The game is unusual in that it is designed primarily for three players, any one of which has a good shot at winning the game (if the Japanese player wins, the two Chinese players can play a Civil War endgame to see who comes in second).<br/><br/>"}, "12274": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Tony Boydell"], "average": "5.39012", "poll": [], "name": "Bloody Legacy", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Take That"], "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "86", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic54568_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Tony Boydell", "Charlie Paull"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Surprised Stare Games Ltd"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic54568.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Humor"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "&quot;An Unnecessarily Violent &amp; Offensive Card Game for All the Family&quot;<br/><br/>Play &quot;traps&quot; against your opponents and &quot;tricks&quot; to avoid the ones that are played against, or find their way back to, you.

And if that displaced peg happens to end up in another peg's hole, another &quot;crash&quot; occurs... This greatly enhances the strategy involved in the pegging phase of the game.<br/><br/>The card play is exactly the same as traditional cribbage and the track is exactly 121 holes.<br/><br/>On the back of the Crash Cribbage board, a regular cribbage board is found.<br/><br/>"}, "12286": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic464674.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Manfred Ludwig"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2004", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Ulrike Fischer"], "boardgamepublisher": ["HABA - Habermaa\u00df GmbH"], "maxplaytime": "15", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic464674_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": ["Action / Dexterity", "Children's Game"], "description": "Crispy fried chickens are to be fished out of a frying pan using a fishing rod.
