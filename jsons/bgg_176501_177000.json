Each turn begins by strategically removing cards from your hand (and deck) through Distilling based on the real-world hierarchy of elements. The goal: only have Xenon remaining in your hand. The problem is, of course, the only way to gain more Xenon, is to bring in more AIR. And AIR is composed of all kinds of other pesky elements that make isolating Xenon difficult.<br/><br/>To combat this, you will need to Buy powerful upgrade cards for your facility in order to become more efficient. These upgrade cards can either be purchased for a lower cost and placed into your system (deck) or installed directly to your facility to be used every turn for the remainder of the game. Or maybe, if you are low on funds, you might decide to place a Bid Token onto an important Upgrade or Contract, thereby giving yourself a discount on a future turn and causing other players to pay YOU extra if they decide to purchase it instead.<br/><br/>After a player has either completed five contracts or installed five upgrades, the game end is triggered and the player with the most Xenon points is the winner.<br/><br/>Do you have the ingenuity, strategy, and tactical fortitude it takes to be recognized by several reputable business publications as the owner of the most influential domestic supplier of Xenon?<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.35176", "name": "Xenon Profiteer", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Hand Management", "Simulation"], "age": "10", "boardgameexpansion": ["189616"], "usersrated": "488", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Gryphon Games bookshelf series"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 037 \u2013 Top 10 Publishers", "Ep 020 \u2013 I, Geek Interviews T.C.

In this game, the cards are colorful particles and the table top is an active collider slamming them into each other for the betterment of science. Experimental patterns called Waveforms are placed into the collider in an attempt to break them down into readable samples. Depending on the strength of the collisions you might get the harmonization of a perfect sample, or the particles might cause an explosion, scattering random particles around the collider and possibly ending the experiment too early.<br/><br/>This game comes with rules for both solitaire and multiplayer games for up to four players. Both versions of the game play very similarly. At the beginning of the game you pick a Waveform, which is a pattern of face up and face down cards played to the table. At the beginning of a player's turn they play one card from their hand by placing it face up onto the table. Once the card is played, the collider engine begins to run.<br/><br/>The collider engine is a set of rules that cause the cards on the table to interact. The highest numbered card located at the bottom of the Waveform will search for the lowest numbered card it can interact with (based on suit). If it finds one, it will pull that lowest numbered card to itself and they will merge into a new number (by adding their numbers together), then one of four different reactions will occur based on that new number. Once that reaction is done, the collider engine begins searching for another possible interaction, and keeps doing so until there are none left, which ends the turn.<br/><br/>Players score points by collecting cards based on some of the possible reactions. In the solitaire game the object is to score well while trying to clear all of the cards from the Waveform. The multiplayer version is all about getting the highest score through multiple rounds of play.<br/><br/>"}, "176548": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2495369.jpg", "boardgameimplementation": ["King's Ransom"], "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Frank Zazanis"], "statistics": [], "boardgamecompilation": ["King's Ransom"], "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": ["Nathan Hansen", "Barry Pike, III"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Victory Point Games"], "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2495369_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game"], "description": "King's Ransom Deluxe, from designer Frank Zazanis II, is a two-player strategy card game pitting royal rivals against each other.

The player assumes the role of a commander of an Infantry Company during its grueling and miserable turn manning a Hilltop Outpost before they are relieved. As the Company Commander, you are responsible for securing your Sector of Front by successfully taking enemy positions and defending yours with the least amount of casualties. Although there are many support units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles. You have the choice to play as a US Marine, US Army, French Army, Foreign Legion or British Commonwealth Infantry Company.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE <br/>The objective of OUTPOST WAR is to successfully survive a Tour in the Hilltop Outposts along the MLR in Korea. A Tour consists of a number of Rotations manning an Outpost on a Ridge or Hill. The Player can play a Short Tour (1 Rotation), an Average Tour (2 Rotations) or a Long Tour (3 Rotations). Each Rotation consists of making a Rotation Deck of 20 &ldquo;Outpost Life&rdquo; Cards and once all Outpost Life Cards have been drawn and resolved, the Rotation is over and the Player totals his Rotation VP and adds it to his Tour VP. Once all Rotations have been completed, the Player totals his Tour VP and then compares it to the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.<br/><br/>OUTPOST WAR can be found at the following URL:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.berserkergames.net' rel='nofollow'>http://www.berserkergames.net</a><br/><br/>"}, "176550": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Kuro"], "poll": [], "name": "SUPER ABDUCTION", "playingtime": "5", "minplayers": "1", "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Better Description Needed!", "Solitaire Games"], "maxplayers": "1", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2492049_t.jpg", "average": "5.5", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Manifest Destiny"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2492049.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Japanese first edition"], "maxplaytime": "5", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "5", "description": "SUPER ABDUCTION is a solitaire card game in which the alien player tries to use their UFOs to capture as many cattle as possible.<br/><br/>"}, "176551": {"rpgdesigner": ["Scott Corum", "Victor Gipson"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Victory's Vault Volume 1, Issue 09", "rpgartist": ["Scott Corum", "Victor Gipson"], "rpgproducer": ["Scott Corum"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2494501.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Science Fiction"], "rpgpublisher": ["Dakkar Unlimited"], "rpg": ["Victory System"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Victory's Vault"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2494501_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/><br/>&quot;Every Item Touched by Victory!&quot;<br/><br/>You can call her Phane Wonderra... she represents an ancient race that pursues the practice of Victory, and if you've got the cash, she'll give you access to the vault of their star fortress.

Something special about this product is that it features a patented word coding method that is unique, but easy to understand. So while enjoying the fun and challenge, players can gain knowledge of vocabulary and coding.<br/><br/>Easy to learn. How to play ... <br/>Step 1: Draw two game cards to determine the &quot;Word Type&quot; and &quot;Spelling Condition&quot; of the secret word to be formed. Reveal the two cards to all players. <br/>Step 2: One player uses the chips to form a secret word by the method illustrated on the Code Machine. Cover it with all windows closed. <br/>Step 3: The other player(s) must crack the secret word with as few windows opened as possible. Ask questions wisely for hints in the process. The player that requires less windows opened is the winner.<br/><br/><br/>In a two-player game, one player is the Encoder, the other the Decoder. The Encoder forms a secret word by the method illustrated on the Code Machine using the information from the &quot;Word Type&quot; and &quot;Spelling Condition&quot; cards, starting from the farthest left position, in correct spelling sequence, and announcing the number of letters in the word. In each round, the Decoder opens one small window at any position and attempts to name the secret word. In each game, the Decoder has a total of three changes to ask the Encoder a yes-or-no question for a hint. The questions can be used all at once or separately. When the secret word is cracked, count the number of windows opened. Switch roles and repeat. The player who required less open windows to decode the secret word is the winner.<br/><br/>In a three-player game, one player is the Encoder and the other two players are the competing Decoders. The Decoders take turns opening windows and attempting to crack the secret word.

Form Galaxy Sword! Omicron Torpedo, fire! Giant robots battle in the style of your favorite Japanese cartoons.<br/><br/>Duel Bots is a card game that lets you design your own deck, load up a giant robot with high-tech components and devastating weapons, then duel head-to-head or in a multi-player death-match.<br/><br/>Duel packs contain two pre-constructed decks. The decks in Galaxy Sword are designed for new players to learn the game. Once you're familiar with the rules the cards can be used alone or with other duel packs to design your own custom deck.<br/><br/>-- Game play summary --<br/><br/>Design your own deck of 32 cards or use a pre-constructed deck from the duel pack. There are three type of cards: components (such as weapons or other gear), resources (which focus on hand management) and damage cards. Damage cards go in a separate pile and you draw them when your robot takes damage. When your damage pile is empty, you lose.<br/><br/>Each turn you may put one component into play from your hand into one of 7 available slots. This sets the pace of the game. Components get more powerful as the game goes on: Tier I components can be played right away but aren't very powerful. You must have 3 components on the table to play a more powerful Tier II component. When 6 of the 7 slots are filled you can play your signature component. Each deck has exactly one signature component, and once they start hitting the table the game will end soon. This follows with the giant robot theme, where mega-weapons tend to decide the battle after some back and forth with smaller attacks.<br/><br/>Damage cards first go into available component slots; you can't play a new component into a damaged slot. You may also put damage on a component on the table, which keeps you from using that component until the damage is removed. Some cards let you move damage to the discard pile where it will eventually cycle back into your hand, so that's just a temporary fix. If instead you pay the cost listed on the damage card you can remove it from the game. There are 5 different kinds of damage with 5 different costs, so choosing compatible damage cards is an important part of deck design. You also choose how many damage cards to use (8 to 12) but the total is always 32 cards, so choosing more &quot;hit points&quot; reduces your available number of components and resource cards.<br/><br/>The game has elements that limit the luck factor present in all card games.

Form Galaxy Sword! Omicron Torpedo, fire! Giant robots battle in the style of your favorite Japanese cartoons.<br/><br/>Duel Bots is a card game that lets you design a custom deck, load up your giant robot with high-tech components and devastating weapons, then duel head-to-head or in a multi-player death-match.<br/><br/>Duel packs contain two pre-constructed decks. Mix and match the cards to build hundreds of possible custom decks. Compatible with Galaxy Sword and all Duel Bots duel packs.<br/><br/>-- Game play summary --<br/><br/>Design your own deck of 32 cards or use a pre-constructed deck from the duel pack. There are three type of cards: components (such as weapons or other gear), resources (which focus on hand management) and damage cards. Damage cards go in a separate pile and you draw them when your robot takes damage. When your damage pile is empty, you lose.<br/><br/>Each turn you may put one component into play from your hand into one of 7 available slots. This sets the pace of the game. Components get more powerful as the game goes on: Tier I components can be played right away but aren't very powerful. You must have 3 components on the table to play a more powerful Tier II component. When 6 of the 7 slots are filled you can play your signature component. Each deck has exactly one signature component, and once they start hitting the table the game will end soon. This follows with the giant robot theme, where mega-weapons tend to decide the battle after some back and forth with smaller attacks.<br/><br/>Damage cards first go into available component slots; you can't play a new component into a damaged slot. You may also put damage on a component on the table, which keeps you from using that component until the damage is removed. Some cards let you move damage to the discard pile where it will eventually cycle back into your hand, so that's just a temporary fix. One card (Repair Bot) moves damage back into your damage pile at the cost of some resources, but in many cases you will need to pay the cost listed on the damage card to remove it from the game. There are 5 different kinds of damage with 5 different costs, so choosing compatible damage cards is an important part of deck design. You also choose how many damage cards to use (8 to 12) but the total is always 32 cards, so choosing more &quot;hit points&quot; reduces your available number of components and resource cards.<br/><br/>The game has elements that limit the luck factor present in all card games. Certain resources let you choose cards from your discard pile, others from your draw pile. The small deck size ensures you will see your whole draw pile several times each game. (The discard pile shuffles to form a new draw pile when it's exhausted.)

In some campaigns, however, it can feel like the player characters are the only people really doing much of anything in the world, as everything and everyone else stands still. With Tomb Raiders in hand, those days are over, as we bring you a quartet of rival gangs with their own tactics and goals, with richly detailed stat blocks and personalities for use in and out of combat.

Rushing to meet insurmountable odds head on, face to face with dangerous enemies and loathsome creatures. Armed with steel and fury, a warrior does the dirty work up close and personal, with grisly effect. Yet in the gaming world, outside of a lucky critical hit, this doesn&rsquo;t always seem to translate well. With Steel and Fury combat becomes more than simply standing toe to toe and following the pattern of...I go...you go.<br/><br/>Combat becomes dynamic and fluid, with combatants taking advantage of tactics and their surroundings. But most of all combat becomes dangerous and in the hands of a skilled warrior combat becomes downright deadly. Now with the use of Steel and Fury, warriors become even more deadly and rightfully so. Showcasing mastery over the weapons they wield by delivering devastating attacks and using the environment to execute precise and skillful maneuvers.<br/><br/>The following Mighty Deeds of Arms are torn straight from the bloody pages of Appendix N material for use by warriors as they quest for gold and glory. Although watching a cultist burn after kicking him into a raging bonfire is a fun and effective way of using a Mighty Deed, sometimes you just want to shatter your foe&rsquo;s spine or split someone&rsquo;s skull to the teeth in a spray of blood and brains. With Steel and Fury your game gains a more cinematic and visceral feel, making the warrior a fun and deadly class to play, not just a meat shield able to absorb damage.<br/><br/>The following work contains 32 new Mighty Deeds of Arms, each presented as a full page chart for quick and easy reference during play. So be ready to stand triumphant over your enemy as he futilely attempts to stuff ropes of intestine back into his torn body or pulverize your foe&rsquo;s internal organs with blunt force trauma. Crush bones, sever limbs, and deliver wicked wounds that bleed uncontrollably or catch your opponent in deadly choke holds and debilitating joint locks while grappling - and that is just to name a few.<br/><br/>Go ahead and flip to a Deed....it&rsquo;s go time!<br/><br/>"}, "176673": {"rpgartist": ["Aaron Acevedo", "Chris Bivins", "Josh Corpuz", "James Denton", "Jason Engle", "Bart\u0142omiej Fedyczak", "Fred Fields", "Ross Grams", "Claudio Pozas", "Aaron J.

Sit back and enjoy your drink because the game changes with the amount of beer in your pint glass. Pound 'em back, or savor every sip; every strategy has advantages. In Alewood, players are working together to kill outlaws but only one player can fire the final shot and win the bounty. Balancing resources, timing your attacks &amp; a healthy dose of deception plays a major role in the game.<br/><br/>The Story:<br/>You are one of the last honest citizens of Alewood, a town taken hostage by outlaws! With no means of escape, all hope seems lost. Until one day, a stranger in a black carriage arrives with a mysterious offer. A one way ticket out of town with a payment&ndash;in blood. Citizens now turn vigilante as you race to be the first townie to gun down 2 Outlaws and win a ticket to freedom.<br/><br/>The Game:<br/>Participants play as characters in Alewood with unique abilities and take turns working jobs, attacking outlaws or dueling each other. Pint glass consumption is only done while someone else is the active player because your drink line will determine how you play on your turn. Trading, striking deals, forming alliances and bluffing is allowed and encouraged. Work as a community to rise against the foes that stole your town but gun for the opportunity when you see it.<br/><br/>On your turn:<br/>1. Place your pint glass flat on the table<br/>2. Choose and resolve 1 Action<br/>3. Draw a card<br/><br/>Actions:<br/>1. Work an Honest Job - Take $2 from the Economy (General coin pile)<br/>2. Take Action - Pay $2 into the Economy and Attack an Outlaw<br/>3. Duel - Both players wager all items and money &amp; duel with dice to see who wins the pot.<br/><br/>The Economy:<br/>Coins are limited in the game and players may choose if/when they would like to change their $1 coins with $5. Without money in the Economy, players cannot work honest jobs or mark damage onto outlaws. A choice must be made in each player whether to chip into the Economy to give everyone a fair shake or to hoard the cash to cripple the competition. However, a player's greed might be their downfall as they'll be tempting targets for thirsty townies. Dueling allows for resources to change hands at any moment.<br/><br/>The Modern Drinking Game:<br/>Alewood is about enjoying your time with friends, savoring your drink &amp; hunting outlaws.

In addition to its pre-painted K-wing miniature, sculpted at 1/270 scale, the K-wing Expansion Pack comes with four ship cards and nine upgrades that dramatically improve the efficiency of your ordnance.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "German Edition", "Italian Edition", "Polish edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "8.0035", "name": "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game \u2013 K-wing Expansion Pack", "playingtime": "0", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action / Movement Programming", "Dice Rolling", "Player Elimination", "Simultaneous Action Selection", "Variable Player Powers"], "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "286", "boardgamefamily": ["FlightPath", "Star Wars", "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game"]}, "176745": {"rpgdesigner": ["Walt Robillard"], "rpg": ["ICONS"], "poll": [], "name": "Predator 0 (ICONS)", "rpgartist": ["Walt Robillard"], "rpgproducer": ["Walt Robillard"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2498257.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "average": "0", "statistics": [], "rpggenre": ["Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"], "rpgpublisher": ["Fainting Goat Games", "Hazard Studio"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["The Super Villain Handbook Character Pack"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2498257_t.jpg", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Spun from the pages of the Super Villain Handbook, we introduce Predator 0!

Ultimate Edition campaign. It adds some background history to the Heroes&rsquo; world, brings in an ongoing adversary, and (most importantly) provides something that is usually very difficult to come up with in a roleplaying campaign: a reason to form a group and also to stay together as as a team.<br/><br/>This adventure can also be inserted into an ongoing campaign by using established or known occult groups from your game world and an older magical-based NPC. Game statistics and mechanics-related things are available at the end of the adventure.<br/><br/>Ideally, this adventure works for a group of Street-Level Heroes.  It works well for a Silver or Bronze Age style campaign.<br/><br/>Background: Once, there was a war between the Pit and Earth. Sumerian sorcerers battled against an otherworldly evil called Demonicus, who hungered to enter our dimension and devour its energies.<br/><br/>The sorcerers cast bindings in the form of an amulet, gambling their own life essences when <br/>the world&rsquo;s mana was not enough. The amulet, known as the &ldquo;Star of Ea&rdquo;, was enchanted to <br/>prevent interdimensional rifts from opening, denying free access to our world by supernatural or otherworldly beings.<br/><br/>Seemingly random crimes began ocurring in the 1940s, and these were traced to a cult controlled by Demonicus. A group of heroes was formed, calling themselves &quot;The Alliance&quot;, each taking ownership of a piece of the Star of Ea... but that was over 60 years ago... and Demonicus is gathering his strength once again. Can the last surviving member of the Alliance find new Heroes worthy of the name in time... and will they be able To Stand Together to protect the world from it's greatest peril?<br/><br/>"}, "176747": {"rpgdesigner": ["Jason J.

Goal of making a go at it is to get 66 or more points in the tricks you capture.  If you make 66, you get your wager (fixed, say 1 pt).  If you make a go and fail to get 66 pts you loose 2x wager (say -2 pts). If you make a go and fail to get more than 33, you loose 4x the wager (say -8 pts). If you make a go and succeed and keep the sum of everyone else to 33 or below, you win 3x the wager (say 3 pts).<br/><br/>The points are: A=11, 10=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2, and 7,8,9 =0.<br/>So there are 120 points on offer, and you need to capture 66 of them.  Remember the 10 is better than the king, and there are rules for using trumps and playing trumps and suits - so if you don't think you can make it, pass the option to make a play to the next person.  If the question to play goes around the table fully and no one takes it, its a bust and reshuffle ( There is no Skat like option of playing with a crappy hand).<br/><br/>Once cards are dealt there will be 2 cards left over - leave those face down.  Whomever makes a play, gets to draw those 2 card into their hand and discard 2 cards, to set aside.  Those set-aside cards count in the scoring of the player  making a play.  So its important what you discard - consider the rules of when suits and trumps need to be played.<br/><br/>First player left of the dealer plays first card (regardless of who decided to make a go of it this hand).  You have to play the suit led with, if you have it.  If you don't have it, but have hearts, you must trump with a heart (your choice which).  If you don't have hearts either, play any card - but you won't get that trick.  If hearts is the first card played, you MUST play hearts if you have it and you MUST play a higher heart if you can.<br/><br/>This way, you can see that its possible to force others to play hearts at certain times and get the trump cards out of play, and then still control play and be able to bring home points with less valuable cards like face-cards.<br/><br/>It sounds very complex, but its not nearly as bad as it seems, and a great light version of Skat.

They have the power to bend human traits to their will, and they will always battle between each other to create the perfect symmetry between virtues and vices of humankind. You will now choose whether to find the best balance &mdash; or completely crush it for your own good.<br/><br/>Overseers is a drafting and bluffing game with a twist. Each player represents an Overseer whose objective is to bend traits in their favor to create the most dominant combination of virtues and vices. The game has three main phases:<br/><br/>1] Drafting: Each player receives six cards at random from the deck, selects one of them, then passes the rest to the player sitting on their left. The goal is to build up the combination that will grant them the most victory points. Some cards grant points on their own, while others require the same type of cards to earn more points.<br/><br/>2] Judgement: All players place their five trait cards in front of them in two rows: two face down and three face up to show the cards they chose. Give the information available, the Overseers then discuss which player has the strongest possible combination. After deliberating, players vote for this person using their token. The chosen player must then admit or deny the verdict:<br/><br/>&mdash; If they admit having the strongest combination, they must then discard two cards from their combination.<br/>&mdash; If they deny this, the showdown phase happens, with all players revealing their scores. If the chosen player has the strongest combination, they lose the two cards that grant the most points; if not, instead they take one additional card of their choice from the discard pile.<br/><br/>3] Scoring: Each player shows all cards in front of them, then calculates their score.<br/><br/>The game might have other phases depending on the type of overseers being played as each character has special abilities that can change the outcome of the game, such as being able to peek at another player's hidden cards, steal a card before the scoring phase, or transform one card into another.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players secret their victory point (VP) tokens to keep their score secret, and after three rounds whoever has the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition", "French first edition", "Italian first edition", "Japanese first edition"], "name": "Overseers", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": ["Card Drafting", "Set Collection", "Variable Player Powers", "Voting"], "average": "7.03452", "usersrated": "414", "age": "12", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["19.

Therefore, nations available in Corsica include the autochthonous Corsican Ancient tribes (3 each player), Greeks, Carthagenese, Etrurians, Romans, Vandals, Ostrogoths, Byzantines, Sarracenes, Lombards, Franks, Aragonese, Vatican State, Pisan, Tuscan, Genoese, modern Corse people (2 different factions), Ottoman, English and French.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Corsica comes with and expansion that adds the II World War conflict to the original game, and a 17th game round.<br/><br/>Invasions take place at the beginning of each game round, and the goal for each player will be to first invade the island  and then try to hold control of it fighting  the new invaders as long as possible, while trying to accomplish his own nation's objetives.<br/><br/>While trying to stick as much as possible to the original game of Britannia, this new version has undergone some minor and major changes in order to addapt the gameplay and game feeling to this new Mediterranean context:<br/><br/>A typical game round of Corsica consists of the following phases: The invasion phase (in which the new invaders attack and settle the island), the diplomacy phase (in which nations can seal up to 4 pacts for the current game round), the internal struggle phase (in which all nations settled on Corsica fight each other), and during punctuation game rounds the punctuation phase.<br/><br/>Cavalry has been removed from the game, as Corsican geography makes it useless, but fleets and sea combat have been enabled, as historically the control of the waters around Corsica has been of great influence. Other concepts like roads, fortifications or watchtowers have been added, and as the island is much smaller than Britannia, movement (both land and sea) has been eased, maybe resulting in a more dynamic game experience.<br/><br/>Corsica is well known  to European tourists for the beauty and quietness of its coasts and inlands.

Do you like fantasy or sci-fi? How much horror do you want to add? How accessible should magic or technology be? A better question may be: What&rsquo;s available for me to play? That&rsquo;s where the Gamers Guide series comes in.<br/><br/>Roleplayers Chronicle originally released The Gamers&rsquo; Guide to Tabletop Role-playing Genres in an effort to answer this last question. The first guide was quite simple and presented a listing of products and what genres those products fell under. Each product was listed with its publisher and a link to that publisher&rsquo;s website was given at the back of the guide. While this may have satiated that desire to know what&rsquo;s out there, it did very little to present each product in a way that gave the user an impression of what it was.<br/><br/>This new series of Gamers Guides expands on that original guide exponentially with an effort to present these game options in a more complete manner. Supplementing this list of games is a look at each genre presented in the guide as a glossary to better understand the terminology being used. When possible, information is provided directly from the publisher&rsquo;s description to present the RPG in their words, not just ours. Roleplayers Chronicle is dedicated to embracing the entire industry of tabletop RPGs without giving precedence to a single system, setting, or personal interest. It is thus that the Gamers Guide series is presented without bias and in a simple reference manner.<br/><br/>"}, "176836": {"poll": [], "name": "Tea Party Simulator 2015", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3006426.jpg", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Power Up to Maximum"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "average": "4", "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Power Up to Maximum"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3006426_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Simulate a tea party by controlling a hand.

The story happens in the near future when the world is dominated by new technologies.<br/><br/>In HINT you will lead a team of selected professionals of a given faction. Each of them has unique skills and abilities, each one can be given weapons and other equipment, be enhanced genetically or cybernetically. All characteristics and modifiers are presented on special character and equipment cards (you don&rsquo;t need to constantly flick through the rulebook). Each character card has a limited amount of slots that can be filled with equipment and modifications. The player can purchase additional equipment to replace the current item depending on the &ldquo;group&rsquo;s assets&rdquo;. You may like your heroes or hate them but they will no longer be just anonymous pawns.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board showing the interior of the Nakamura corporate tower that is under attack by its rivals. The characters are moved using spaces on the board. This eliminates the need to measure distance when moving and fighting thus quickening the pace of the game and allowing to avoid misunderstandings. Each space presents a specific tactical situation that influences the characters placed on it.<br/><br/>Game mechanics are fairly easy as we wanted to achieve a perfect balance between a fun game and rules that enable a lot of tactical possibilities. The basic rules are easy to learn but the possibilities of their use grow significantly in combination with the characters&rsquo; skills and capabilities of equipment. The characters are defined by their basic physical and mental abilities and modifiers, which make it easier or more difficult to perform some tasks, that make them unique. These modifiers result from their skills, special training or cyberations and other equipment. The rules do not use any dice and the testing mechanics are based on cards that we call CanDo. The description on the card, its value and colour influence the final result of the test.

Each army attacking you has its own strenghts and weaknesses, you have to know them to succeed!<br/> Strategy:<br/>Choose carefully which Island to invade, spy on the enemy to evaluate his forces. In Yrminsul, your opponents try to reclaim the islands you control. You will have to defend your territory from your enemies' sneaky attacks. At the same time, you will invade their Islands.

This month's Pyramid -- the PDF magazine for roleplayers -- looks at the power of the spirit, and how it can be used for good or nefarious purposes.<br/><br/>Our soulful selections include:<br/><br/><br/>     &quot;Blessed Be,&quot; an extensive deconstruction of the Blessed advantage from GURPS guru Sean Punch, with lots of ways to refine its scope and abilities. Now you can become Angel-Blooded, a Wilderness Guardian, or a Speaker for the Gods . . . or countless other options you can build and use yourself!<br/>     &quot;Clerics of Order and Chaos,&quot; which adds factions of Order and Chaos to the eternal crypt-crawling struggle of GURPS Dungeon Fantasy. Invite to your party an unholy warrior of order, a chaos druid, and much more!<br/>     &quot;The Voice of the Moon,&quot; this month's Eidetic Memory offering from GURPS Spaceships author David L. Pulver. Learn the secrets of a 17th-century cult, the details of its modern reconstruction, and the powers of the Moorstone (with GURPS effects). Defeat these guys, or become members (or former members) . . . and, no matter what, keep reaching for the moon!<br/>     &quot;Cursed Thou Art,&quot; Christopher R. Rice's in-depth look at the Divine Curse disadvantage, and how it can be reused or reformed in new and terrifying configurations.

Is it too good to be true, or the dawn of a new era? The choices are yours, with a small add-on from Pyramid editor Steven Marsh that offers to include the abilities of GURPS Psis in many different settings.<br/><br/><br/>This issue also unleashes a Random Thought Table that looks at maintaining and controlling the unbelievable, plus Odds and Ends featuring a Murphy's Rule that's too cruel to be kind.

Fortunately, automated probes sent to Mars have discovered celerium, an ore that can be combusted to produce ten thousand times more power than a steam engine, and sylvanite, the densest substance ever found. More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality.<br/><br/>As the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy &ndash; if you can reach them before your competitors. You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet's most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible. At your command is a team of nine professionals. Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch.<br/><br/>In each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round. Each spaceship has a specified destination, and until an astronaut sets foot in a region, no one knows which resource they'll find. Players collect resources (worth points) three times during the game, and they each have a secret mission card that might grant them additional points at game's end. During the game, players might acquire an additional mission or a research card that changes the value of what awaits on Mars.<br/><br/>The 2015 edition of Mission: Red Planet features the same gameplay as the original 2005 edition, but it includes:<br/><br/><br/>    Components for up to six players instead of five<br/>    Special two-player variant rules<br/>    New action cards and revised mission and discovery cards<br/>    Mars' moon Phobos as a new zone that astronauts can explore before possibly returning to the planet itself<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "French edition", "German edition 2016", "Italian edition", "Polish edition", "Spanish first edition"], "average": "7.66262", "name": "Mission: Red Planet (Second Edition)", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Control / Area Influence", "Hand Management", "Simultaneous Action Selection"], "age": "14", "usersrated": "4253", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Family Games", "Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Mars", "Steampunk"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["Cult of the New Board Game Podcast 003 \u2013 10 Games for Essen 2015!", "Cult of the New Board Game Podcast Episode 009 \u2013 Top 10 Games of 2015", "Ep 016 \u2013 BGG Con 2015 Recap Extravaganza!!", "Episode 19: Samurai, Artifacts Inc. &amp; Mission Red Planet", "Episode 29 - Fragile Games", "Mission: Red Planet, Gaming With Family - Boards &amp; Swords #54", "MOBG 31 Specter Ops 12-5-15", "MOBG 40 7th Scythe 24-10-15", "MOBG podcast 39 This is the Real Deal, Part 2 of Spiel Essen", "Sweet Strats Episode 9: Mission Red Planet", "The Dice Steeple - Episode # 9 - Bruno Faidutti"]}, "176921": {"poll": [], "name": "Memo Tierfamilien", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Memory"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3186656_t.jpg", "average": "6", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Paletti"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3186656.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["Paletti version"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Animals", "Memory"], "age": "4", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A variation of the standard Memory where you need to find Triplets instead of pairs.

In a distant kingdom lived a King who ruled over a mighty nation. But alas, the kingdom was torn in two as factions began to form against the King. Now the king must draw upon his closest allies else he will battle against them for the future of the kingdom. They are: The King, The Warrior, The Wizard, The Queen, The Goblin and The Villagers.<br/><br/>This game creates several unique strategies. Do you choose items or characters that you can stack up to ensure victory, but at the risk of letting your opponent have automatic victory points because you cannot engage in every battle? Or will you go with special characters like the wizard who have a high probability of victory on their own? Or will you use special items to gain the advantage by increasing your attributes or peeking at the other players cards before you have to make a decision. The choice is yours, but choose wisely, because every decision you make will lead to victory or your untimely demise.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>The 8 character cards are shuffled and placed between the two players, face down. Each player draws two cards, then decides which of the two to keep and which to put back. Shuffle and repeat until there are only two character cards left.  These two cards are randomly distributed.<br/><br/>Repeat these steps for the item cards except stop once each player has three item cards.  Place the remaining item cards to the side as they will no longer be needed this round.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>The player who went first is now the attacker. They select one character card and one item card and place them face down.<br/><br/>The second player is now the defender. That player selects a character card face up and an item card face up. If a card allows additional cards to be played, it is played now.<br/><br/>The attacker then reveals their cards. If a card allows additional cards to be played, it is played now.<br/><br/>The battle: If the attacker's Attack value is higher than the defender's Defense value, the attacker wins. Else the defender wins. In the event of a tie, the defender wins.<br/><br/>Winner takes all of the cards and puts them in their discard pile. Once a player is out of characters to play with, the other player places the rest of their cards into their discard pile.<br/><br/>Players go through their discard pile and count up the Health Points (which are victory points). Player with the most points that round wins the round. Winner decides who goes first for the next round.

Unfortunately, there are other cats trying to horn in on all the fun feline experiences your neighbourhood has to offer, but with careful allocation of your four paws and crafty use of special cards, you can be the one who emerges from this cat fight with the lion&rsquo;s share of the points.<br/><br/>The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of each, colour-coded activity cards worth 2-4 points are displayed at each house on the block. Players secretly allocate their four paws to houses and/or to their basket, which earns them extra cat cards at the end of the round. Certain cards are worth a bonus point to particular cats, which helps guide choices. Then players lift their screens and move their paws to the houses.

On 12 June patrols from the 11th Hussars and the KRRC quickly breached the wire. Attacking at dawn and out of the rising sun, the Hussars surprised and confused the Italian defenders, who watched as their machinegun posts were suppressed by British mortar fire and their tankettes destroyed by British armored cars and close-range machinegun fire from Vickers tanks. These raids continued through the rest of June and July of 1940, until the British 7th Armoured Division was recalled for a refit in Egypt. The raids destroyed many Italian vehicles, considerable supplies of ammunition and petrol, and significant water storage. Twenty-five Italian officers (including a general of engineers) and five hundred other ranks were captured. This series of raids also marked the beginning of an overall erosion of Italian morale, as the inadequacy of their tank armor and the scarcity of effective antitank weapons and ammunition became apparent....<br/><br/>ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS: Frontier War is a detailed new ASLComp VARIANT that tells the story of the War in North Africa.

Il Duce failed to take into account the fighting spirit of Tommy Atkins and his commanders.

And the entire affair became a major problem for Mussolini's Italy and dreams of more easy conquests on the African Continent.

As the Gazala positions crumbled, Rommel pushed his men and machines ever eastward along the Via Balbia, in pursuit of what he thought was a beaten enemy. Rommel's best troops raced forward in the van. Italian units followed behind. The Desert Fox knew the enemy was in disarray. Rommel also knew British supply lines and the ability to move units into the front line improved with every retrograde mile they retreated. The Italian XX Corps began moving east along the Via Balbia late on June 30, heading for participation in Rommel's last ditch attempt to reach Alexandria. Their trip would not go without incident as the British suddenly appeared from the desert flank, precipitating a vicious firefight. Their tormentors were units of the British 7th Motorized Brigade, sent forward to buy time for a new line to be formed at El Alamein. The quick-hitting unit handled the Italians roughly before pulling up stakes and moving off. The resulting Axis losses were not serious in terms of manpower.

It is assumed that this is due to the film's intense plot which deals with a woman being repeatedly molested by a ghost. Ironically the game has nothing to do with movie's sexual subject matter and instead involves moving the entity into higher planes existence. Horizontal lines representing these planes scroll downward on the screen. Each line has a gap (i.e. portal) and the player must use walls to force the entity through the hole and into the next plane. Liquid Helium can be used to slow down the ghost. The game ends when the supply of helium runs out.<br/><br/>"}, "176968": {"poll": [], "name": "Zombicide Survivor: Lucius", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2015", "boardgameexpansion": [], "usersrated": "35", "boardgamefamily": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Zombicide"], "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2503790_t.jpg", "average": "7.24286", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["CMON Limited", "Guillotine Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2503790.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Expansion for Base-game", "Miniatures", "Zombies"], "age": "13", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Lucius is a promotional Survivor that was added to Season 3 Kickstarter campaign.

The player's party then challenges different dungeons based on various elements of different Final Fantasy games. Challenging a dungeon level requires the use of stamina - a limited resource which slowly regenerates over time. Completing all the levels of a dungeon provides access to new dungeons and potentially new party members, new equipment, and other resources, including an increase to maximum stamina through the collection of stamina shards.<br/><br/>An important resource obtained through the completion of dungeons is Mythril, which can be used to obtain rare equipment, regain all spent stamina, to heal between dungeon levels, to continue after defeat in battle, and to increase the inventory limit for equipment and for abilities. These effects can also be obtained through the expenditure of real-world money.<br/><br/>Battle is real-time, and uses a simplified version of the ATB combat system. Sprites are in a 16-bit retro style, drawn either from other Final Fantasy games or created specifically for Final Fantasy: Record Keeper. Music is drawn from the various Final Fantasy games.

Each Player creates a Player Soldier during the Napoleonic Wars. The Player Soldiers will attempt to gain Merit Points in order to advance in rank throughout various Campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars. Player Soldiers can be assigned to a Cavalry or Infantry Regiment serving in the British or French Armies. This game is especially suited for fans of Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe Series, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Brigadier Gerard Series and Richard Howard's Alain Lausard series.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>The Objective of the Game is to have your Soldier be the first to complete his Career during the Napoleonic Wars. Career Progress is tracked by moving your Soldier&rsquo;s Counter along the Game Board&rsquo;s Career Track. The Career Track consists of Garrison Duty and Campaign Duty Assignments. These Assignments will result in a variety of situations and encounters including Skirmishes, Patrols, Battles, Encampment, Headquarters, Siege Assaults and Special Missions in which the Player&rsquo; Soldier must resolve. The outcome of these Encounters and Situations determine whether the Player&rsquo;s Soldier advances along the Career Track. While the Soldiers conduct Challenges, they might gain or lose Merit Points, which are used to improve their Attribute Ratings and Rank. The Player Soldier with the Highest Rank after reaching the Ending Space on the Career Track, is the Winner. If this is tied, then the Soldier with the most Merit Points remaining is the Winner. If this is tied then the Soldiers may conduct a Duel to determine the Winner.<br/><br/>"}, "176990": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2856885.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Louis Malz", "Stefan Malz"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2016", "maxplayers": "5", "boardgameartist": ["Michael Menzel"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Eagle-Gryphon Games", "eggertspiele", "Pegasus Spiele"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2856885_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": ["Economic", "Expansion for Base-game"], "description": "Take apprentices' final examinations and attain master craftsman's diplomas to get better trained employees, procure jewelry for your guests, and hire specialists.<br/><br/>The Rococo: Jewelry Box expands the base game Rococo without changing its basic rules.

(Note: You must take care to follow the order in which you are authorized to erect buildings). Each investment is provided added value thanks to a rent which becomes higher and higher, as this enables the player to set up a cash flow for himself. But if it is true that all of the players collect rent for their respective properties, they must also pay money out when they pass over the properties of other players.<br/><br/>Moreover, the game has a number of small surprises that the player must evaluate in advance to avoid finding himself at loss. Of course, &quot;Le Jeu de Polyn&eacute;sie&quot; Game, is only a game and the names of the property, islands, assets indicated as well as the card rules have no basis whatsoever in reality. This game is a pure fiction that seeks only to entertain your children and the big kids that we have remained too!<br/><br/>User description:<br/><br/>Players take the part of land owners in French Polynesia, attempting to buy and then develop their islands. Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes. The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money or, in a timed game, to be the player with the largest amount of assets.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio. If a player owns all the spaces within a colour group, he may then build hotels, farms or a fishing fleet on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which cannot be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail. The game allows a player to purchase insurance or hire an attorney, to have some protection against some forms of misfortune.<br/><br/>"}, "176992": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Chris Pringle"], "poll": [], "name": "Bloody Big Battles!", "playingtime": "360", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Dice Rolling", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "4", "maxplayers": "8", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2763574_t.jpg", "average": "9.25", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["SkirmishCampaigns"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2763574.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "360", "boardgamecategory": ["American Civil War", "Civil War", "Miniatures", "Napoleonic", "Post-Napoleonic", "Wargame"], "age": "10", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Rules for wargaming the Late Nineteenth Century with historical miniatures.

They have clear, simple, but carefully thought-out victory conditions, designed both to recreate the historical situation and to generate an exciting and balanced game that can be completed in a sensible period of time. A particular joy of fighting historical actions on this scale is that usually both sides have several different viable strategies available, meaning the scenarios are full of replay value and can produce quite different games each time.<br/><br/>"}, "176993": {"rpgdesigner": ["Richard D.
