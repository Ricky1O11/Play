You get points the further back in the track you place them, as this creates a more refined product, but it will take longer to get these resources to the front of the supply track where they can be used.

In Pocket Battles: Confederacy vs Union &mdash; the fourth title in the Pocket Battles series &mdash; tiles represent troops and troops make up units in your army; just determine the size of the battle, then create your own army from a pool of existing troops. Each tile hits on certain rolls, and some can only melee while others can shoot. Some tiles also have special traits that can affect their whole unit or army.<br/><br/>The basic rules of the game are fairly simple: Two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide at the start of the game how many points they will give to their armies, which then determines how many points you must defeat to win.<br/><br/>On your turn, you choose which faction of your army to send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just one token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round costs you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus one. (If one token is on a unit, it costs two additional tokens to activate it again; with three tokens on the unit, it costs four additional tokens, etc.)<br/><br/>After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy your units.

Opportunities are ripe in this community of traders, bankers, moneylenders, and dealers of grains and spices. Fortune awaits the one who plans well and uses his resources wisely. Oil, silk, incense and spices are the currency used to build tents, establish settlements, and amass riches &mdash; but commerce brings competition, and the space to build is limited. When there is no more room, the player who has maximized his resources to become the most successful merchant is the victor!<br/><br/>In Bania, players use resource cards to buy and build tents, then strategically place these tents on the board to earn points. When no legal moves remain on the board, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. On a turn, a player performs these actions in order, if possible:<br/><br/><br/>    Collect your bonus: If your elephant marker sits on a tent tile on the board, collect one resource card of each type in the settlement where the marker is located.<br/>    Buy and place tent tiles OR roll for resources: As explained below.<br/>    Place your elephant marker: If your elephant marker isn't on the board and you placed tent tiles that turn, place the marker on one tile you placed this turn.<br/><br/><br/>Each player starts the game with four tent tiles and eight resource cards: two of each type (oil, spice, silk and incense); one side of the tent tiles shows one of these four resources, while the other side shows three resource symbols (e.g., two spice and one silk). If you want more resources, you can roll the four dice up to three times, locking any dice that you wish while doing so. When you stop rolling, you receive one resource card for each resource symbol showing; in addition, if you have both a front and back half of an elephant showing on the dice, then you receive an elephant marker bonus as at the start of your turn.<br/><br/>If you have the right cards in hand, you might instead choose to buy and place tents; if you have twelve or more cards, then you must do so. A tent costs three resource cards matching the three resource symbols on the back and you pay this cost after placing a tent on the game board, but if you place a tent adjacent to other tents, then the cost is discounted based on the colors of adjacent tents, possibly allowing you to place a tent for no cost at all! When you place a tent on its own to start a settlement, you receive 3 points; for all other tents placed, you receive 1 point each. You refill your hand to four tent tiles at the end of your turn &mdash; but if you've placed all four, you can immediately draw four new tiles and keep building!<br/><br/>A settlement can have at most seven tents in it; when someone places the seventh tent, any elephant markers in the settlement are removed and returned to their owners. The game ends when no more tents can be placed. Whoever placed the final tile scores 3 points, and whoever has the most of each type of resource card scores 2 points.

Good! You and the other players each have a team of five scientists, and you want to capture animal species so that you can study them &mdash; and, of course, score points.<br/><br/>The game board in La Isla consists of a set of oddly-shaped tiles that are placed in a circular arrangement around a central polygonal tile. Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display. All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available. Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card.<br/><br/>After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card.<br/><br/>Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp. (If all of a player's scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.) If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points).<br/><br/>Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal. You (and only you!) immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale. If you don't have an animal of that tpe you don't get any points. Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game. The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game. When the sum of these values for all five animals equals seven, nine or eleven (based on the number of players), the game ends at the conclusion of the round.

It takes its name from its popularity among members of Britain's Royal Air Force.<br/><br/>Multiple variations of the game exist. The two most common are the 9-5-2 (also known as the Canadian version) and the 8-5-3 (the British, Indian and Near-East Version).<br/><br/>8-5-3 version:<br/>As per <a target='_blank' href='http://www.pagat.com/whist/sergeant.html' rel='nofollow'>http://www.pagat.com/whist/sergeant.html</a><br/><br/>Object of the Game<br/>The aim is to win as many tricks as possible. If a player succeeds in winning 12 or more tricks in one hand, the game ends and that player wins.<br/><br/>Deal and Card Exchange (first hand)<br/>The first dealer is chosen at random. The cards are shuffled, cut and then dealt singly, 16 to each player. The last four undealt cards are placed face down on the table to form a kitty. The dealer names a suit as trumps (clubs, spades, hearts or diamonds - &quot;no trump&quot; is not allowed), discards any four cards face down, and takes the four undealt cards from the kitty in their place.<br/><br/>The Play<br/>The player to dealer's left leads any card to the first trick. It is compulsory to follow suit if able to; a player holding no card of the suit led may play any card. Each trick is won by the highest trump it contains, or if there are no trumps in it, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.<br/><br/>Targets and Scoring<br/>Each player has a target. The dealer's target is 8 tricks; the player to dealer's left has a target of 5 tricks; and the player to dealer's right needs 3 tricks. A player who won more tricks than the target is said to be up by the number of tricks won in excess of target. A player who failed to reach the target is down by the number of tricks short. The player(s) who are down pay one stake per trick short of target, and the player(s) who are up receive one stake per overtrick.<br/><br/>Deal and Exchange (second and subsequent hands)<br/>The turn to deal rotates clockwise, so the new dealer is the player who led to the first trick previous hand. The pack is shuffled and cut and 16 cards each are dealt singly as before.<br/><br/>Now each player who was up on the previous hand gives away one unwanted card per overtrick to a player who was down, and that player must return the highest card(s) held of the same suit(s). The exact procedure is as follows:<br/><br/>If just one player was up, that player gives each of the other players as many unwanted cards face down as they had undertricks. These cards are all given simultaneously. The other players add these cards to their hands, and for each card received, they give back face down their highest card of that suit. A player who has no other cards of the suit received will of course have to give back the same card.<br/>    If two players were up, the player with the higher target for the hand about to be played trades first. This player gives (face down) as many cards as he or she had overtricks to the player who was down, and that player gives back face down the highest card(s) held in the same suit(s). After that, the other player who was up gives a card per overtrick to the player who was down, and receives in exchange that player's highest card(s) in the same suit(s).<br/><br/>After this exchange of cards is complete, the dealer names trumps, discards four cards and takes the four undealt cards. If the dealer was down and had to give away the highest card of a suit, but then picks up one or more higher cards of that same suit from the undealt cards, any such high cards must be shown privately to the player(s) who traded cards in that suit.<br/><br/>The play and scoring then proceeds as described above. The targets are always 8 tricks for the current dealer, 5 for the player who leads to the first trick, and 3 for the other player.<br/><br/>End of the Game<br/>The game ends when any player succeeds in winning 12 or more tricks in one hand, thereby winning the game.<br/><br/>9-5-2 version:<br/>The game is identical to 8-5-3 apart from the following:<br/><br/>    The targets for the three players are:<br/>        Dealer - 9 tricks<br/>        Player to dealer's left - 5 tricks<br/>        Player to dealer's right - 2 tricks.<br/> After trading cards and choosing trump, the dealer picks up the four kitty cards before discarding four.<br/><br/>If the the actual dealer was down by 3 tricks or more in the previous turn and gives 3 of his highest cards accordingly, he may look at the kitty before choosing trump.<br/><br/>A cumulative score for each player is kept on paper. The score for each hand is assessed based on whether the required number of tricks were taken (zero score), more tricks were taken (plus score of number of tricks over required tricks) or fewer tricks (minus score of number of tricks under required tricks). Scores are totalled with the score from previous hands, and the total score of all three players should always be zero.<br/><br/>9-5-2 is played to a target score agreed in advance, usually 10, 15, or 20 points. The game ends when someone's score reaches or exceeds the target (with that person winning) or when someone's reaches or exceeds the negative value of the target (with that person losing and ending the game).<br/><br/>Other versions exist such as the 9-5-3 variation with no kitty (played in the Royal Navy), 6-3-8 played with 51 cards and no kitty,and the 7-4-1, a 4 players variant with its own entry in the database.<br/><br/>"}, "154253": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2391362.png", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Kenneth C.

Each player creates or adds to melds using Expedition cards in order to reach ten or more points. If ten or greater points is achieved that expedition would be considered to have found enough proof for science to take notice, thereby doubling that set's score. Also during each turn a single Anomaly card (action card) may be played which can do things like strengthen the value of an expedition in play, retrieve cards from the Tabloids, discredit other players expeditions or manipulate other facets of the game. At the end of a round, cards in the Tabloids that match expeditions in play discredit that expedition.

A very similar game is played by children in Argentina, where it is known as Casita Robada. In Italy it is known as Rubamazzo, and in Quebec it is called Paquet Voleur (literal translation of steal pile in French).<br/><br/>Players and Cards<br/><br/>Stealing Bundles is a fairly simple fishing game, for 2, 3 or 4 players, normally using a standard 52-card pack. To start the game, everyone draws a card and the player drawing the highest card deals first.<br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>The dealer shuffles, and then deals the cards out clockwise one at a time: four cards face down to each player and four face up to the centre of the table. The centre cards are laid out separately so that all are visible. The remainder of the pack is kept face down by the dealer and will be used later. The players then pick up their hands of four cards and look at them (but of course are not allowed to look at other players' cards).<br/><br/>The player to the dealer's left starts, the turn to play passes clockwise around the table. At your turn you must play one card from your hand face up to the table. If the card you play matches the rank of any of the face up centre cards, you must take the card you played and any matched cards and place them in a face up pile in front of you, to start your 'bundle'. (Suits are ignored in this game: a King matches a King, an Eight matches an Eight, and so on.) No matter whether you matched a card or not, it is then the next player's turn to play.<br/><br/>Any matched cards that you acquire during the game are always stacked on top of your bundle, with the card you played on top, so that only this top card is visible.<br/><br/>If you play a card that matches the top card of an opponent's bundle, you steal their whole of their bundle and add it to the top of yours, placing the matching card that you played on top.<br/><br/>After everyone has played their four cards, the same dealer takes the remaining undealt cards and deals another four cards face down to each player, one at a time (but no further cards to the layout). Again the players look at their hands, and play continues as before. After all these cards have been played another four cards each are dealt by the same dealer, and this process of dealing and playing continues until all the cards have been dealt and everyone has played their last four cards. At this point, any cards remaining face up in the centre are added to the bundle of the last player who matched a card.<br/><br/>Now the cards in each are counted and whoever has the largest bundle wins.<br/><br/>If you want to play again, the turn to deal now passes to the left. The new dealer shuffles all the cards and another game is played as described above.<br/><br/>Casita Robada and Rubamazzo<br/><br/>The Argentinean game Casita Robata, is essentially the same. The only differences from Stealing Bundles are:<br/><br/>A Spanish suited pack of 40 (or 48) cards is used;<br/>    The game is played counter-clockwise.<br/><br/>The Italian game Rubamazzo is played counter-clockwise with an Italian 40-card pack.<br/><br/>"}, "154325": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Don Lloyd"], "poll": [], "name": "Clockwork Island", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Action Point Allowance System", "Area Movement", "Dice Rolling", "Storytelling", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2017", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": ["Admin: Unreleased Games", "Steampunk"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3429564_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["(Unpublished)", "Knight Works, LLC"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3429564.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fighting"], "age": "14", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "In Clockwork Islands players take over the role of explorers in a mysterious land with undiscovered riches and dangers.

As the population and job opportunities expand, players have the opportunity to upgrade their zones and earn money, both of which earn players even more points.

Each player draws three cards.  At the beginning of each player's turn an extra card is drawn from their deck before choosing one to lay (Rule not included in First Edition rules)<br/><br/>The initiating player begins play; in a series of games the winner goes first. The first player plays a card naming and describing it. The picture on the card must be referenced and only played as one thing. Turn order goes clockwise; the next player will play a card in an attempt to defeat, gain control of, or disable the card(s) in play by naming their card and describing how the opposing card was conquered. The defensive player has the ability to defend themselves once per turn as does the attacker. When defeated, the player will remove their defeated card in surrender. Rounds continue until a player has either played something no other player can overcome, or defeated the previous opponent and no cards are left to play. If either happens the game is over and whoever played the remaining card in play is the victor of The Ultimate Showdown!<br/><br/>Guidelines of Play<br/><br/>The same or similar thing cannot be played twice. Players can add one non-explicit trait per card. If there is a debate as to if a card should beat another, defer to the spectators judgment first, or vote of players in game second, or lastly rock-paper-scissors. All rulings are final and the game moves on. One exception to the rule is the last battle can be declared a stalemate if there is no clear victor.

Immediately draw one card from your personal deck, as indicated on the Abbey card, to replace the card you just played. (!)<br/><br/>5. You must now decide if you wish to keep exploring, or stop. You must make this decision before revealing the next Abandoned Abbey card!<br/><br/>6. If you decide to keep exploring, flip over the top card of the Abandoned Abbey.<br/><br/>&bull; You must again discard a card with a symbol matching that on the face-up Abandoned Abbey card.<br/>&bull; If you succeed then return to step 3, above.<br/>&bull; If you fail, you lose all the Abandoned Abbey cards and rewards from this turn of exploration. This can mean losing multiple cards and rewards! (Do not lose anything already acquired in earlier turns of the game.)<br/>&bull; Return unclaimed rewards to the supply. Discard unclaimed Abbey<br/>cards to the bottom of the Abandoned Abbey deck, face-up.<br/><br/>7. If you decide to stop exploring, then claim all the rewards and cards received in this exploration and add them to your supply (keep Abandoned Abbey cards separate from your deck; turn them face-down). Players should keep track of all the Abandoned Abbey cards that they collect. Sets of these cards apply towards victory as shown on the Abandoned Abbey Quest Goal card. Combine totals for partnership games. Each player (or partnership) may collect no more than 7 Abandoned Abbey cards in total.<br/><br/>8. End the turn.

The men represent and are called arrows, and are shot at the target by the proper moves. The object of the game is to see who will make the best shots with his three arrows. All moves are made by the spin of the Teetotum, using the mum of the numbers obtained by the spin, and moving an arrow aver a corresponding number of spaces. Spin for lead. The highest spin plays first. The arrows are first entered according to the spin, beginning st. and counting from the space at the flag-staff. After entering, each player, in turn, advances his arrows ac-cording to his spins, until they reach the target. Any arrow that is carried beyond the target by the spin is a miss, and counts nothing. An arrow is carried beyond the target when there are not enough spaces for it to be moved over, to use up the spin. Each ring of the target represents two spaces, one on each side sf the bull's-eye, as though the target were divided by a vertical (meat its center.<br/><br/>The arrows are moved from the flag-staff to the target as though the whole formed one continuous line of 23 spaces-7 in the target, and 16 outside. As soon as an arrow reaches the target its move is ended. Two or more arrows of the same, or of opponent players, may 'soupy the same space at the same time. The game is ended when all the arrows have reached or missed the target. Each arrow on the outer circle counts 1; on the next ' circle, 2; on the third circle, 3; and, on the bull's-eye, 6.<br/><br/>The player having the largest count wins the game.<br/><br/>GAME OF MORRICE (Nine Men's Morris)<br/><br/>Implements - Eighteen men in two colors; a set of nine for each player. The charming game of Morrice, which closely resembles, and is probably the source of &quot;Go-Bang,&quot; is the inside game, laid out in black lines, with circular spaces at the points where the lines cross or intersect each other. The object of each player is to get three of his men in a row, that is, upon the three spaces on any one of the straight black lines. All of the lines are used alike, no distinction being made between the long and the short ones. Play in turn throughout the game, and place or move but one man at a time. The players in turn, first place their men, one at a time, upon any vacant circular space, each trying to get three men in a row, and at the same time playing to prevent his opponent doing so. Thus, a player trying to form a row, will lay down two men upon the same ; but the opponent, if on the lookout, will lay down one of his men on the third space of the same line, and stop him. Sometimes players scatter their men in such a manner, that by laying down a single man, they have two ways by which they can form rows, upon their next turn, and as only one of these can be stopped by the opponent, they necessarily gain a point. Each time that a player, forms a row, he captures and removes One of his opponent's men front the board, but must, if possible, take one that will not break his rows. When all the men have been placed upon the board, one at a time, as above described, the players try to form rows by moving their men from space to space, in any direction. Sat all moves must be along the lines, always moving to the next space. As often as a player forms a row, whether in placing or moving his men, he captures one of his oppoaent's men. As soon as either player loses all but two of his men, he can form no more rows, and therefore loses the games<br/><br/>GAME OF QUOITS<br/><br/>Implements - Sixteen men in four colors&mdash;a set for each player, and the Double Teetotum. There are two sets of Quoit spaces, at each side of the board. The first and third players play for one set, and the second and fourth for the other.<br/><br/>Play and spin in turn. The highest spin leads. Use the sum of the numbers indicated by the Teetotum in making the moves, except in case of a doublet, which has its corresponding numbered Quoit space. The first player spins and places his man upon the Quoit space which corresponds to his throw. The others follow in turn playing in the same manner. Four rounds are played in this way, and the score is then made up. The count is as follows : Each man on the hub counts ten ; on a double number, three ; and on the other numbers two. In addition to the above, the man nearest to the hub counts five I the next nearest, three'; and the third, one. If two men hit the same space, the first corner is set back one space, if the rear space is vacant ; if occupied, the man goes for-ward on space, but should this space also be occupied it is removed from the board and does not count for its player. When four rounds have been played, the game is begun anew, and the play continues until some one of the players scores 60, which wins the game.

This project takes the Death Ride Kursk game system to a new level.  The maps for the entire 9 game series have been redone.  The design for the new maps was done by Rick Barber and the artwork by Kyle Gebhardt.  Game play is still characterized by the BOS, or Battlefield Operating Systems.  The rules have been restructured to include all of the rules for the enhancements.  They have also been reformatted to make it easier to understand and improve rules clarity.  Remember that even though the basic system is an I-Go-U-Go type system the order in which units move and actions occur is very open.  Players have a tremendous amount of flexibility to perform firing, movement, and obstacle removal, can be done when the player needs them to be done.  This means you get to control the synchronization of the battles activity to suit your plan.<br/><br/>While the rules are now quite large, they are very comprehensive.  Players will find great richness and depth in the level of detail.  There are now four different levels of game rules play.  From Basic to Ultimate.  For those wanting to play the basic game system you will still find great depth and detail.  For those wanting the ultimate experience you will find plenty of additional rules in the enhancements to make you feel like a real staff officer.<br/><br/>This game will be the base for the three SS games and the follow on games for Leibstandarte and Das Reich will be expansions.  Totenkopf will be needed to play the other 2 games.  Included in this game will be the counters for the Command and Control and Fire Support Enhancements.  These add some great details and rules right from when you make your purchase.  The Air, Maintenance, and Logistics Enhancement counters will be sold separately and are not yet ready for sale.<br/><br/>This game will come with:<br/>(16) 11x17 Full Color Map Sections<br/>(10) Unit and Marker Counter Sheets<br/>Death Ride Kursk Rules Booklet<br/>Totenkopf Rules Supplement<br/>(3) d10 Dice<br/>Numerous Charts and Tables<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English first edition"], "average": "7.5", "name": "Death Ride Kursk: Totenkopf", "playingtime": "100", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hex-and-Counter"], "age": "16", "boardgameexpansion": ["172065", "172066", "163921"], "usersrated": "6", "boardgamefamily": ["Death Ride"]}, "154354": {"poll": [], "name": "Singstar Deutsch Rock-Pop", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["German PlayStation 2 edition"], "average": "8", "videogameseries": ["SingStar"], "videogametheme": ["Music"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["SCE London Studio"], "videogamegenre": ["Party", "Rhythm"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 2"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>A karaoke game released in the SingStar series.

It is the Americanized version of a card game that originated in Central Europe in the late 18th century under the German name Schafkopf.<br/><br/>Sheepshead is played with 7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A in four suits, for a total of 32 cards. A sheepshead deck is made by removing all of the jokers, sixes, fives, fours, threes, and twos from a standard deck.<br/><br/>Card strength:<br/>Card strength in sheepshead is different than in most other games. It is one of the most difficult things for some beginners to grasp.<br/><br/>There are 14 cards in the trump suit: all four queens, all four jacks, and all of the diamonds. In order of strength from greatest to least:<br/><br/>Q&clubs; Q&spades; Q&hearts; Q&diams;<br/>J&clubs; J&spades; J&hearts; J&diams;<br/>A&diams; 10&diams; K&diams; 9&diams; 8&diams; 7&diams;<br/>Also, there are 6 of each &quot;fail&quot; suit (18 total).<br/>A, 10, K, 9, 8, and 7 of &clubs;, &spades;, and &hearts;<br/><br/>Clubs, spades, and hearts take no precedence over other fail suits, unlike trump, which always take fail. (Notice how both aces and tens outrank kings; arguably the most confusing aspect of card strength). The lead suit must be followed if possible; if not, then any card may be played such as trump (which will take the trick), or a fail card. Playing a fail of a different suit is called &quot;throwing off&quot; and can be a way to clear up another suit. Additionally, throwing off a point card is called &quot;schmearing&quot;.<br/><br/>Card point values:<br/>Each card is given a separate point value as follows:<br/>Ace &mdash; 11 points<br/>Ten &mdash; 10 points<br/>King &mdash; 4 points<br/>Queen &mdash; 3 points<br/>Jack &mdash; 2 points<br/>9, 8, 7 &mdash; 0 points<br/><br/>The strongest cards (queens and jacks) are not worth the most points, giving Sheepshead some of its unusual character.<br/>There are 120 points total in the deck. The goal of the game is to get half of these (60 or 61); in case of a tie, the player who picked up the blind loses, and that player's opponents win. (There are variant rules for more peculiar situations, such as the Leaster.)<br/><br/>This is one of the few traditional card games with a hidden partner.<br/><br/>Jack of Diamonds is a random partner method where the picker receives a partner without needing to call or lead a suit. The picker can still choose to &quot;go it alone&quot;, but needs to declare before the hand begins.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": ["Public Domain edition"], "average": "8.17833", "name": "Sheepshead", "playingtime": "30", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Partnerships", "Trick-taking"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "36", "boardgamefamily": ["Traditional Card Games"]}, "154395": {"rpgartist": ["Daniel Gorringe"], "rpg": ["Monster of the Week"], "statistics": [], "name": "The Sidekick", "rpgdesigner": ["Michael Sands"], "rpgproducer": ["Steve Hickey"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1916224.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgitemversion": ["PDF Version"], "average": "0", "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (Modern Urban Fantasy)", "Horror (Supernatural)", "Modern"], "rpgpublisher": ["Generic Games"], "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "poll": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1916224_t.png", "description": "From the Introduction:<br/><br/>I'm not really that tough, you know?

Your goal is to control the most guilds when the game ends.<br/><br/>Shuffle the whole deck and place it facing down in the middle of the table. This is the Draw Deck. Next to it a (now inexistent) Discard Deck will be created.<br/><br/>Determine the starting player by any peaceful means. Players take turns in anticlockwise order during the game until the endgame condition is reached.<br/><br/>On their turn, players must do only one of these 2 actions:<br/><br/>- Pick one card from the Draw Deck or the Discard Deck.<br/><br/>- Buy cards.<br/><br/>How to buy cards:<br/><br/>1. Place one of your cards facing up before you. This is the Influence Card.<br/><br/>2. Draw up to as many cards from the Draw Deck as the number on your Influence Card.<br/><br/>3. Place the Influence Card facing up on the Discard Deck.<br/><br/>If, at any moment, the Draw Deck gets exhausted, the game ends.<br/><br/>Each player adds up the values of each guild on their hand. The player with the highest value for each guild controls that guild and scores a point (tip: score the 12 guilds in order for clarity). In case of two or more players having the same value for a guild, none of them scores for it. The guild of blue suns is an exception and scores two points. So there are 13 available points in total.<br/><br/>Ties for the first place are broken by the lowest number of cards. If a tie persists then play again.<br/><br/>Variants:<br/><br/>Variant 1: Cards can be bought from both decks.<br/><br/>Variant 2 (the Market): You can buy cards from another player.

Goemon, a cunning thief and an avid treasure hunter, has nothing to do and sits in his house being bored. But his trusty friend Ebisumaru has good news: there is a big treasure to find somewhere in a big city across the sea. Of course the treasure will not be just given to Goemon: he will have to perform a dangerous mission before. The two friends board a ship and thus the journey begins...<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>This game is the first title that really defined the Goemon (Legend of the Mystical Ninja) series. It is a virtual atmosphere of a Japan where every myth and legend that ever came to exist are brought to life in this game, be it amazing clockwork machinery, Ice spirits that are out to haunt the player, or a trip down to hell for harming the Ojisan statues.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, the general goal of the game is to progress from territory to territory by getting to the gate while collecting three passes. Finding these passes is no easy task, as you must hunt out secret passages and traverse complex mazes to obtain them. So just like the previous title, it's an Easter Egg hunt. Don't make the mistake to assume this game is exactly like the original, as the player will find it far more fine tuned. There are fewer randomly hidden passages in this title, which allows him to enjoy exploring the stage more. The player will have plenty of time to enjoy the many diversions as he goes along his way, be it fighting off police and stray rabbits, buying video game cartridges, or trying to sneak into the woman's Onsen. And to clear the difficulty of getting lost in towns, new signs have been added to help you keep track of where the player is going. Also, just about every stage also offers a store or two that will sell the player's passes in case he is burnt out from all the searching.<br/><br/>The game diverges from the original as we have more pure action stages where the goal is as simple as finding the end bosses, and stages themselves offer greater mazes and challenges. And how can one mention this game without talking about its two player cooperation mode? During the two-player mode of the game, it is critical that the players work together in tandem, as one player's action directly influences the other. Both money and items are shared in this mode, as well as the effects of items collected on screen. It can make things difficult on stages that require a lot of movement, but overall a fun and welcome addition.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Ganbare Goemon Gaiden 2: Tenka no Zaih\u014d&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "154431": {"poll": [], "name": "Ganbare Goemon Kirakira D\u014dch\u016b: Boku ga Dancer ni Natta Wake", "videogamemode": ["Local Multiplayer", "Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Super Famicom edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Legend of the Mystical Ninja"], "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy", "Ninjas"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Konami"], "videogamegenre": ["Platform"], "videogameplatform": ["SNES"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami"], "description": "Ganbare Goemon Kirakira D\u014dch\u016b: Boku ga Dancer ni Natta Wake is the fourth Ganbare Goemon game released for the Super Famicom on December 22, 1995.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>At the request of Impact, Goemon and his friends travel to several planets in order to defeat the evil commander Harakiri Seppukumaru.

Each player starts with a single banner in his castle but also takes the banners of any captured castles.<br/><br/>The cards act as die modifiers (General and Marshall), allow attacks one would not normally be able to make (Admiral), get armies at the start of a turn (Reinforcements), force temporarily non-aggression pacts (Diplomats) and look at another player's cards, discarding one in the process (Spy). The Spy card can also be used to defend against another Spy.<br/><br/>Risk<br/><br/>Players are given army units to place onto the map of the world.

Hard-eyed men and women brood in the waterfront dives and shabby tea houses, selling their swords for a few bright coins or the promise of a dead man's treasures. In the wilderness, the lost cities of vanished empires and fallen races lie deep within the jungle shroud, and the desperate efforts of colonists and refugees strain to contain the horrors that threaten on every side.<br/><br/>It is a time for legends. It is a time for fearless warriors and eldritch adepts to rise from this hard-pressed people and defend them from the nightmare that threatens to engulf them all.

Whether for a spouse, kid, curious friend, or just as an alternative to boardgames for those nights when only one or two friends can make it to the gaming session, Scarlet Heroes gives you the tools for good old-fashioned skull-cracking adventure.<br/><br/>Scarlet Heroes can be used both as a stand-alone RPG and as an overlay over your favorite old-school game to make its adventures playable for single PCs or very small groups. It shares the same classic statistics and basic game mechanisms as these old-school favorites, but by changing the interpretation of these numbers it makes it possible for a single courageous adventurer to dare perils that would otherwise threaten a half-dozen freebooters. With Scarlet Heroes, a GM can pull out a favorite module, grab a convenient friend, and a have a full night's adventure with no tweaking, alteration, or adjustment of the material needed.<br/><br/>Inside the pages of this book, you'll find&hellip;<br/><br/>     A full stand-alone RPG system that can also be used as an overlay atop most popular old-school games.<br/>     The Red Tide campaign setting as a default for the game, with a full bestiary of Southeast Asian-inspired monsters, suitable new magic items, and a full list of new cleric and magic-user spells for that setting.<br/>     Sixty new adventure tags of the sort beloved in Stars Without Number and the Red Tide Campaign Setting sourcebook.

The board represents the inside of a dreamer's mind, who is known as the Mark. Each player is trying to plant an idea in the Mark's dream, hoping that when he wakes, he will carry out their chosen task. The key is to make your task seem achievable to the Mark and to make sure he believes it was his own idea from its inception. In order to do this the dream needs to be so real, that when the Mark wakes up, the planted idea sticks and he performs the mission without a second thought.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with his or her own mission. This is the core idea that they are trying to plant inside the Mark's mind before the dream ends. Each mission is comprised of four steps: Architect, Forger, Extractor, and Inception. Players must collect the correct number of cards for each of these four steps in order to plant their idea fully. This is done by circling the different dream levels in the direction of your choice. There are spaces for collecting cards and planting ideas. Once an idea is planted in a certain section of the Mark's mind, that section is full. The other players must move to another dream level where the section in need is still available. There are also spaces where players encounter the Mark&rsquo;s subconscious, which can either help or hurt you.<br/><br/>As you move down the dream levels to plant the different phases of your idea, you gain more points. However, it takes more time the further down the levels you go, so you have to plan your route wisely. Ultimately, the Mark will only carry out one player's planted idea when he wakes. This player receives extra points and increases his or her chances for victory.<br/><br/>"}, "154484": {"poll": [], "name": "Ganbare Goemon: Tengu-t\u014d no Gyakush\u016b!", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Japanese Game Boy Color edition"], "average": "0", "videogameseries": ["Legend of the Mystical Ninja"], "videogametheme": ["Cute Fantasy", "Ninjas"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Tose"], "videogamegenre": ["RPG"], "videogameplatform": ["Game Boy Color"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Konami"], "description": "Ganbare Goemon: Tengu-t\u014d no Gyakush\u016b! is a Ganbare Goemon game released for the Game Boy Color on January 14, 1999.
