Which is of course exactly how real chemists and scientists see them. If they come away from the game remembering a fun fact about an element, or understanding the basic notions of bonding and charge, they will have a powerful head start in understanding chemistry&quot; - Theodore Gray, co-founder of Wolfram Research (makers of Mathematica) and Popular Science columnist.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Elementeo builds on games like Magic: The Gathering and Pok&eacute;mon by appealing to kids with its fun factor, but also focusing on the education side. The world should take notice.&rdquo; - Peter Adkison, CEO of Hidden City Games, and former CEO of Wizards of the Coast (the makers of Magic: The Gathering and distributors of Pok&eacute;mon).<br/><br/>Update: The first version of Elementeo (v1) has sold out, the next version (v2) is expected to hit amazon.com in the beginning of summer 2012.

The object is to be the fastest over three legs or three runs over the entire track.  In the 1980's the sport was a bit different.  Road sections were over public streets and going too fast or too slow garnered a time penalty. The Special stages were over closed public roads, private roads or trails in rural areas and speed was not restricted. In the game, the Road sections have a set number of dice throws in which a player is to travel the section with his car.  You may roll one or two D6 that have numbers 1,2 or 3 on the faces. Finishing in less rolls garners a 10 second penalty and finishing in too many rolls gets a 5 second penalty. For each special stage, a card is drawn with details of that stage and players must try and choose the best tyres for that stage, with weather conditions being a contributing factor.  Then an Unexpected Weather condition card is drawn.  The tire choice combined with info from the two cards modify the die rolls during the Special stage. The player then chooses to roll the red die that has more pips and two crash faces or the blue die with less pips and only one crash face. Along the Special stages are spaces that result in car damage if a player lands on those spaces. Prior to starting the race each player may place Repair Stations along the Road sections to repair damages incurred along the Specials stages. If a player lands on a Damage space in the first Special stage, that Damage penalty, 10 seconds, will be applied thereafter to each section until the player meets the requirement for entering one of his Repair Stations.  The player who completes the three Legs in the fastest time wins the rally/game.<br/><br/>Basically a roll and move game with a bit of flare within the theme of the sport as it was conducted at the time of the game's production.<br/><br/>This being a game for the Pirelli tire company, there is more information concerning tires in the game materials than is necessary to play the game.  The only tyres available are from Pirelli and the game materials seek to show how each tyre should be used, with the rulebook containing a lot of information about how rallies were organized and run at that time and how to choose tyres for each stage.<br/><br/>"}, "30840": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Julien Blondel"], "poll": [], "name": "Noodles!", "playingtime": "90", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Dice Rolling", "Role Playing", "Storytelling", "Variable Player Powers"], "yearpublished": "2006", "usersrated": "4", "boardgamefamily": ["Asian Theme"], "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic568401_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["NekoCorp"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic568401.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["NekoCorp Edition"], "maxplaytime": "90", "boardgamecategory": ["Adventure", "Comic Book / Strip", "Exploration", "Fantasy"], "age": "8", "minplaytime": "90", "description": "Adaptation of the comic strips series published by Soleil, designed by Severine Gauthier, Thomas Labourot and Christian Lerolle, &quot;Extraordinary Adventures: Noodles!&quot; propose you to live the history of Kikitte, Isha, Peko and Mayoke.<br/> Discover the magic universe of Noodles! by achieving the quest which your Sentetsu Master entrusted to you.

Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.<br/><br/>The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;. So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.<br/><br/>In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.<br/><br/>This is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.

After playing many others in my life I set out to take all the good and get rid of all the bad I saw in those games.  That along with some innovative game play makes this game something special.  The game play is simple yet captures every aspect of the game of football.  Players perform just like they did in the season recreated.  Using a combination of Fast Action Cards and dice plays develop using the personnel on the field.  Your linemen can get called upon to make a play, the defensive secondary may have to stop the run or your linebackers may have to break up a pass.  If it is inside the game of football it is in Inside Blitz.<br/><br/>With defensive players rated in 7 categories, you can see the strengths and weaknesses of all the players.  From coverage skills in four depths of passes to their run defense you will see the weak links.  Not all pass rushers and ball hawking DBs were created the same and here you will see who those players are.<br/><br/>Linemen, receivers and runners are rated for run and pass blocking.   Your sieve of an offensive line will allow more pressure while those staunch linemen will protect your QB like Fort Knox.  You will see the blockers blast running lanes or fail to get room for your runners.<br/><br/>Quarterbacks have 4 different throwing depths so the deep ball guys will perform as such.  Those dump off guys will get their shots downfield but when pressured they will look to their comfort dink passes. The pass rush and scrambling system can really bring out the anticipation of those type plays as well.<br/><br/>Receivers are rated for pass catching ability in three depths down the field.  All receivers have their own 6x6 cards for each depth of pass with the ability to bust one for a longer gain if they can get loose.<br/><br/>Runners are rated for inside and outside running making each runner completely different.  Along with each players own 6x6 card for each type of run you will see where the home-run-hitter type runners will get the all or nothing yards while your consistent bull of a back will get his yards no matter but don&rsquo;t expect a big one.<br/><br/>You have never seen a solitaire system like this one!  Play calling takes into account down, distance and the style of play of both the offense and defense.  Using all this also gets defensive platoons into the game without any hassle on the gamers part.  The distribution of who gets the ball is taken care of with ease.  You won&rsquo;t be seeing a bomb to your clod-footed TE but your track star will be targeted more often at that depth.<br/><br/>Special teams, penalties and propensity to fumble are not overlooked in this game.  Each coverage team is given ratings to reflect the way they played on the season.  Teams are rated separately for penalties which is a very important aspect of football that gets glossed over with many games.  Finally each player is given their own fumble rating to show how each player took care of the ball.<br/><br/>All this is presented in a professional and quality way making Inside Blitz the game of the new generation.  Come on inside!<br/><br/>"}, "30938": {"boardgamedesigner": ["John Archer"], "poll": [], "name": "Atom Smash", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Set Collection"], "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Abstract Games"], "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic687167_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Archer Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic687167.jpg", "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "30", "description": "Command the forces of the atomic world as you battle the strength of your opponent's elements and compounds.

In the board game Tribune: Primus Inter Pares, players take on the role of a powerful and ambitious patrician family.  By applying influences and manipulating controls over the various factions, they attempt to pave their way to victory in order to attain the high office of the tribune.<br/><br/>From the mind of the highly acclaimed designer of Die Macher, Karl-Heinz Schmiel, the gameplay in Tribune  is a combination of worker placement and set collection.  Each round the players take turns by positioning their followers on the board to garner cards, achieve objectives and/or attempt to take over factions.  In order to gain control of a faction and to utilize its benefits, one must play a set of cards from that specific group.  That person will remain in command of the faction until someone else stages a successful take-over by having another set that is either of higher quantity or higher sum of values.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved when a player has met the required number of objectives as specified on the victory condition card selected at the start of the game, which is dependent on the number of participants.  Alternatively, you can choose to forego the use of a condition card and play with the point-value option.  In this variant, the game ends when someone has collected a certain number of the faction markers and the winner is the one with the highest scores as determined by the points assigned to each achievement.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "French edition", "German edition", "Italian edition", "Spanish edition"], "average": "7.25298", "name": "Tribune: Primus Inter Pares", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": ["Auction/Bidding", "Card Drafting", "Hand Management", "Set Collection", "Worker Placement"], "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": ["38777"], "usersrated": "3935", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Strategy Games"], "boardgamefamily": ["Ancient Rome"], "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["BGTG 85 - SR &amp; Feedback (with Rattlesnake, XiangQi, Citadels, Manila, and Tribune)"]}, "30958": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic257854.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Scott Fisher"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2007", "maxplayers": "12", "boardgameartist": ["Tom Tullis", "Kevin Weber"], "boardgamepublisher": ["SkirmishCampaigns"], "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic257854_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": ["Aviation / Flight", "Miniatures", "Wargame", "World War II"], "boardgamehonor": ["2007 Origins Awards Historical Miniature Game of the Year Winner"], "description": "Check your 6! is an air combat simulation of the 1925-1947 era and can be played with any aircraft from this era, including the early jets.<br/><br/>Movement is planned ahead and simultaneous.

Through his cunning diplomacy and well-timed military actions he was responsible over the next 43 years for expanding the state of Muscovy enormously, conquering, annexing, or marrying into the lands of Rostov, Yaroslavl, Ryazan, Novgorod, Vyatka, Tver, and a substantial piece of Lithuania, while forming sturdy alliances with Pskov, the Crimean Tatars, Kazan, and Denmark, and at the same time having to deal with religious controversies and the periodic treacheries of various boyars and even of his own family. His son Vasily III and grandson Ivan IV (the Terrible) extended his remarkable gains even further. Essentially, Ivan single-handedly created what we now know as the Russian nation.<br/><br/>During most of his reign, his most powerful rival was Casimir IV, Grand Prince of Lithuania, although, despite much peripheral conflict, Muscovy and Lithuania did not go to all-out war until 1500, some eight years after Casimir&rsquo;s death.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME: In brief, Muscovy is trying to gain control of or subdue as many countries as possible before the big war with Lithuania, while maintaining high levels on the Ivan's Prestige, Russian Orthodox Church, and Victory Point charts. Some of these countries will become full allies, others will just be reduced so as not to cause serious trouble in Ivan&rsquo;s rear later on. Once the war with Lithuania begins, Muscovy will try to take over as much territory from Lithuania as he can. (Military success may possibly make up for any shortfalls in the three charts.) The Lithuanian player is simply trying to throw as many monkey wrenches as he can into Muscovy&rsquo;s plans by keeping up pressure on various fronts, military and geographical (the map) as well as political (the charts).<br/><br/>There is a 22-turn campaign game, and there are five shorter scenarios.<br/><br/>"}, "31000": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1541665.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["(Uncredited)"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "1994", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Milton Bradley"], "maxplaytime": "25", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1541665_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "25", "boardgamecategory": ["Children's Game", "Fighting", "Movies / TV / Radio theme"], "description": "Power Up, Rangers!

It contains detailed discussion of the rationale behind these rules, grounding them in military theory and history.  The book contains two sets of rules:  an elementary set for playing simple games and an advanced set of rules to provide a richer simulation.

On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.<br/><br/>Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose.

Their solution was the Omega Suit.<br/><br/>&quot;The Omega Suit represents the ultimate development of military technology.  Each suit stands over 7' tall and is manned by a genetically superior soldier called an Omega Warrior.  The Omega Suit is a fully enclosed system which enhances strength, reflexes and senses of its wearer.

And there are copyists, who will dispute the glory you've earned for your monuments...<br/><br/>The game shows monument cards with 12 types of ancient monuments like the Pyramids or the Colosseum (9 per type). The game is played in turns and usually you take a &quot;monument turn,&quot; consisting of 3 actions allowing you to collect cards, to build monuments, and to expand your existing monuments. For example, it takes you one action per card to draw it either from the draw pile or the 3 faceup cards near it.<br/><br/>If you have some cards showing the same monument, you can use another action to erect this monument in your display. In case you are the first one to build this type of monument, you only need two cards - the second player building this same type of monument must have at least 3 cards. And no third player is allowed to build the same monument! Thus, playing your cards early makes it easier for you to erect the monument. But it saves you actions to collect some cards before displaying it, because regardless of the number of cards used, erecting one monument only counts as one single action.<br/><br/>Your monuments will receive their eternal fame only, if they are part of history. Each player has 2 (in a 3 player game: 3) historian tokens. In a historian turn, you have no monument action, but only write a history about all of your OPPONENTS' monuments (not your own ones!). Monuments get famous, and the owners receive victory points at the end of the game - the more often your monuments are in such histories, the more points you get. However, only interesting monuments of at least two cards are considered for a history, and by writing a history, the historian takes one card away (removes it from the game)! Thus the monument could be cut down to only one card during the game and will be not interesting to later historians any more. Why should I write a history and make the monuments of my opponents more worthy? If you do not use all of your historian tokens, you will be punished with 12 negative points at the end of the game! And you get additional victory points in the case that you write histories with a lot of monuments mentioned in it.<br/><br/>You should make your monuments interesting to historians again. During a monument turn, you may use one action (regardless of the number of cards played at the same time) to add cards to a monument that you have already erected.<br/><br/>In MONUMENTS, timing is important, and you have to decide what the best move to do now is: Should I wait for another Petra card, or shall I display the Petra Monument this turn? Is it advisable to make a historian turn now or is it better to choose a monument turn and draw the faceup cards, which I really need - taking the risk that I cannot write a history next turn and wind up getting negative points!<br/><br/>Finally, you have to consider that you are not sure about the victory points for your monuments. The points are related to the monument during the game, and if the Akropolis monument is worth 12 Points for example, you will only get 4 points if another player manages to erect an Akropolis monument that is greater than yours. This damn copyist will not only receive all your bad wishes, but 8 of the 12 Akropolis Victory Points - even in the case that his monument was not part of any history.

War, economics, science and diplomacy are to be taken into consideration to successfully win this epic game.<br/><br/>In Rise of Empires two to five players are building their own civilization from the dawn of history to present times. All players start small and fairly powerless, however, through clever play they try to gain wealth and progress in several areas.  Like many empire building games, it is possible to be wiped from the board one turn, only to return the next in another area.<br/><br/>Rise of Empires is divided into three eras. Each era consists of two game turns. The core of the game is the Action Display where players conduct various actions during a turn. The first turn in an era is called the A turn, the second one the B turn. In a way, the B turn is a mirror image of the A turn.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Victory points are scored by building cities, having an empire (area control), developing technology, and trading goods.<br/><br/>In contrast to some other civilization type games, Rise of Empires plays fairly quickly. A full game can be completed in less than three hours.  It is also more abstract than many civ games, in that cities, towns, and technologies are represented by tiles the players keep, even if their civilization is buried in the sands of time.<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Don't just make history-guide it! Take the reins of a developing civilization, choosing the resources and development paths that will lead to the fastest expansion, as you claim and defend territory on a map forging an empire that eventually encompasses whole continents.<br/><br/>Rise of Empires play is divided into three eras. Choices made early in the era are repeated late, so your decisions must have both short-term and long-term benefits to be successful. This process requires tough decision-making and promotes an atmosphere with nail-biting suspense. Victory points are rewarded for building cities, having an empire, for progress in science, and for trading goods.<br/><br/>Rise of Empires breathes new life into the civilization games genre!

Each row has a start value of ten and four spaces to fill, except one space marked (+), resulting in fourteen spaces in all to fill. Each player has 10 stones to place: four square value stones (4, 3, 2, and 1), three round arithmetic symbol stones (the minus sign, the division sign, and the multiplication sign), and 3 tall round scoring markers (two in their own colour and one in their opponent's). Players take turns to place one stone of their own choice from their own supply onto the appropriate spaces. After all stones are placed, the scores are determined. Each player scores all the rows that are marked by the tall scoring stones of their color (one of which is placed by the opponent), and the score for each row is the outcome of the simple formula that players have created with the stones. Whoever gets the most points overall is the winner.<br/><br/>Adam Riese, in the title, refers to the great German mathematician Adam Ries, better known as Adam Riese (1492-1559), whose work contributed to the phasing out of the impractical Roman numerals in favour of the Arabic numerals that we currently use, and who made it his life's ambition to bring the basics of mathematics and algebra to all people. For that reason, he wrote his science books in German, rather than in Latin, the language of the scientific elite, and was one of the first to do so. The German phrase &quot;nach Adam Riese&quot; (according to Adam Riese) is still used as an expression in the German language to emphasize the obvious correctness of a result of simple arithmetic.<br/><br/>"}, "30710": {"boardgamedesigner": ["Malcolm Goldsmith", "Michael Kindred"], "poll": [], "name": "One The Board Game", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "3", "boardgamemechanic": ["Co-operative Play", "Voting"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "18", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic228877_t.jpg", "average": "0", "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Foundery Press"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic228877.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Religious"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "&quot;An enlightening and non-competitive game for Christians from different backgrounds to explore and share their beliefs&quot; (From box cover).<br/><br/>Players move their pieces, answer questions and vote on Christian discussion topics to gain game segments.
