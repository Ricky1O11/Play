Combat and damage mechanics are extremely detailed. Everything is simulated in game if possible. There are no abitrary &quot;to hit chance&quot; values in Battleships Forever. The game also features many innovative mechanics that you've never seen before. For example, the Cronus Battleship sports a Flux Shield generator that allows you to draw a defensive force shield around your ships in any shape you want. Another example are the Deflector modules that are used extensively through the game. These modules make a single section of a ship totally invulnerable to fire. This means that you will have to manoeuvre your ships to attack sections of the enemy ships not protected by Deflectors while keeping your own protected sections facing the enemy. Position is paramount!<br/><br/>Players will command picked fleets made up of Battleships, Destroyers and Patrol Craft. The completed game will include ten campaign missions and multiple skirmish modes.<br/><br/>Battleships Forever is inspired by and loosely based on Warning Forever by Hikoza.T.Ohkubo<br/><br/>Source: The Developer's Website.<br/><br/><br/>     Redeveloped from: Warning Forever<br/><br/><br/>"}, "85503": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Eye of Judgment: Legends", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"70489": "PSP Network edition"}, "average": "8", "videogameseries": {"5444": "The Eye Of Judgment"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "1", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4432": "PSP"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The Eye of Judgment: Legends is a PSP spinoff of the PS3 game The Eye of Judgment.

Jackie embarks on an adventure to stop the Prince of Sorcerers and his minions and save his sister.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The player controls Jackie Chan, the well-known martial arts  stunt master, and brawls against many enemies during his quest to save his sister. The game is played through five levels (each with a boss at the end).<br/><br/>Throughout the game, The player would encounter frogs that carry power-ups or bowls, (which are items in the game that restore health), but the frogs would have to be hit in order for the item to be obtained. Power-ups can allow the player to do a special type of attack over a limited amount of times (although the player is only able to carry one power-up). The player is also able to charge a special beam-like attack, although it can only be used up to five times. Most of the enemies that the player defeats will drop green orbs. If the player collects 30 orbs, life will be replenished (as well as the 5 charged shots).<br/><br/>If the player dies, all of the orbs and power-ups are lost and must be gained again. The player only has 1 life in the game, but may continue up to five times initially.

At the end of 30 seconds, those points are tallied and may also be used to buy extra lives and special attacks.<br/><br/>Version Differences<br/><br/>In NES version, collecting 30 orbs will replenish health and charged shots.

Stack-Up is one of two games in Nintendo's Robot Series, the other being Gyromite (AKA Robot Gyro). While Gyromite was a pack-in game with the R.O.B. itself and therefore came with all the parts needed to play the game, Stack-Up came in a large box containing additional bases and colored discs. Because it was marketed to children and the set came with many small, plastic parts, complete copies of the game are very hard to come by. All Stack-Up cartridges contain the 60-pin circuit board from the Famicom version attached to a 72-pin adapter like the T89 Cartridge Converter for the NES. This is one of the rarest first-party games for the NES.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>In some modes, Professor Hector works with R.O.B. to organize blocks. In others, Hector competes for control of R.O.B. against &quot;glitches&quot; named Spike &amp; Flipper, or against Professor Vector.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The player must direct Professor Hector to jump onto buttons, that each activate an action for R.O.B., in a sequence in order to get R.O.B. to arrange the colored discs in a certain order on the five pedestals around R.O.B.<br/><br/>Different Modes of Play<br/>Bingo (1P): Like the other single-player modes, the player progresses through phases by moving the blocks from one arrangement to another, but in this mode block colors are irrelevant, and the difficulty is derived from the method used to control R.O.B. The screen is occupied by a 5x5 bingo board that Professor Hector hops around on. Rows on the bingo board correspond to R.O.B. commands: and when a row is completed, the command is executed. The computer-controlled enemies Spike and Flipper roam about, and touching either one will send Professor Hector flying back to the starting position. Spike wanders randomly, but Flipper moves in straight lines from one side of a row to another, activating and deactivating spaces wherever he lands, potentially sending undesired commands to R.O.B. The game ends when a block is dropped.<br/><br/>Bingo (2P): In this mode, only Professors Hector and Vector occupy the bingo board, competing to send commands to R.O.B., with the goal in mind that player 1 wants more blocks to R.O.B.'s left, and player 2 wants more blocks to R.O.B.'s right. The game begins with three blocks in the middle, and one block to either side.<br/><br/>Test: This mode sends a signal to R.O.B. that causes his LED to light up, confirming that he can receive signals from the television.<br/><br/>Direct: The player begins by arranging the blocks in a standard starting pattern (red, white, blue, yellow and green top-to-bottom on tray #3), and is given a randomly chosen pattern they should be rearranged into by entering commands for R.O.B. one at a time. Once the goal is achieved, the player must press start to inform the game. Score is then calculated based on the time and number of moves taken, and the game moves onto the next phase, for which the starting point is the previous phase's ending position. Phases grow increasingly complicated to execute as the player progresses. Play continues until a block is dropped. The score at that time is the final score, and the player must return to the menu screen by pressing select.<br/><br/>Memory: Like Direct mode, except that rather than entering commands one at a time, the entire sequence of commands must be programmed in advance. R.O.B. goes through the program all at once. Once the sequence has run its course, the player presses start to move on to the next phase or select to return to the main menu. Scoring is the same as in direct mode, with the time score derived from the time taken to enter the commands, not the time taken to execute the program.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Stack Up&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "85537": {"rpgitemversion": {"70611": "PDF Version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "The Day of Deeds", "rpgproducer": {"41775": "Sarah MacNeil"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"232": "Mutants & Masterminds (2nd Edition)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"3500": "M&M Superlink"}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/>A city like any other, a day like any other, except.

Playing as the nimble-pawed protagonist Jake, a plucky pup with a nose for adventure, the player must sniff out a sinster dog-napping plot involving the canine-hating Miss Peaches and Jake's pedigree chum, Daisy.<br/><br/>Dog's Life allows the player to take the role of a lifelike hound, able to fetch, sniff out food, chase chickens and explore.<br/><br/>An American Foxhound named Jake is the main character and his overall objective is to save Daisy, a Yellow Labrador Retriever whom Jake is keen to impress, and a lot of other dogs from a crooked cat-food company CEO, Miss Peaches and her two henchmen, Wayne and Dwayne. Bones must be collected to advance through the game and they can be obtained by digging them up, by beating other dogs in a variety of challenges, by completing tasks given by human characters, and by collecting special smells.<br/><br/>After Jake has rescued all the other dogs, he proceeds to rescue Daisy from the deadly cat-food machinery. Miss Peaches is then knocked into the machine by Jake and Daisy is saved.<br/><br/>The game allows the player control or interact with over 15 breeds each with distinct traits and abilities. They handle things in a different way, that can also be used in challenges or puzzles.<br/><br/>The game is divided into three areas: Clarksville, a rural town; Lake Minniwahwah, a ski resort; and Boom City. These are then divided into smaller areas such as districts or farms. In every area are humans willing to give missions in exchange for bones. Bones can also be found buried underground or hiding somewhere.<br/><br/>Certain smells picked up through the game's &quot;Smellovision&quot; will activate challenges against a local dog. In each small section of the game there are four challenges, two of which are to find eight smells of the same colour and compete against a local dog. These missions include races, obedience trials, tug-of-war games and a territorial game where the player must run around urinating in marked areas to obtain territory.<br/><br/>There are also salons in some levels where Jake can get his coat cleaned and brushed. He also gains a shiny new collar with a silver 'J' at the front.<br/><br/>Once these dogs are beaten, the player is able to take control of that dog and use their special abilities to find other bones. Other challenges include scent-collecting challenges, and a minigame called &quot;Doggy Do&quot;, where the player must copy the moves of the local dog. There are also dangers in certain areas, such as the dog catcher and his Doberman. The player must also keep the Jake healthy by feeding him, allowing it to defecate and coax people into giving the player snacks by growling and barking or performing tricks unlocked by doing the obedience trials. Jake is able to do a range of tricks including begging, sitting, lying down and marking his territory.<br/><br/>Jake can interact with NPC's some things include chasing chickens, steal sausages, and shake kittens.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Dog's Life,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "85579": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic983826.png", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "8", "boardgameartist": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"26208": {"name": "Winning Moves Germany"}}, "maxplaytime": "0", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic983826_t.png", "minplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1021": {"name": "Economic"}}, "description": "From manufacturers description:<br/><br/>Monopoly Schwarzwald (black forest) by Winning Moves.<br/>The regional editions of Monopoly.

A large branch (and some say the remains of a pulley) hung directly above the pit. He recruited friends and, armed with shovels, they began to dig. They found a solid floor of oak-logs every 10 feet for a considerable depth. Sea-water floodied the pit and prevented them from digging further. What still lies buried over 100 feet below the surface depends on who you ask: Captain Kidd&rsquo;s treasure, Incan gold, Shakespeare&rsquo;s lost manuscripts, the Holy Grail, or perhaps nothing at all.<br/><br/>Over the years more men brought their ingenuity to bear on the problem, but failed. The failures were due to lack of modern machinery and ignorance; each excavation being stopped by water and lack of funds. A new century brings new technology and every hope that the mystery of Oak Island will soon finally be put to rest.<br/><br/>Oak Island is a board game for 3-5 players attempting to get to the bottom of the mysterious treasure pit on Oak Island. The amateur treasure hunters bring their resources to bear on the problem of excavating the pit, and compete with each other to publish their findings and theories using an innovative scoring system.<br/><br/>Players take turns picking up a row or column of resource cards from the card display. Action cards set in the display are triggered when a player picks it up. Machinery cards in the display do not refresh until the next round. A round ends when a player picks up the Treasure Trove License card, triggering an excavation.<br/><br/>The Money Pit consists of consecutive tiles that are revealed as they are excavated jointly by the players. In order to excavate a tile, the symbols shown on it must be matched on resource cards invested secretly and simultaneously by the players. Each resource card has an abstract monetary value ($, $$, or $$$); the players are ranked in order of investment, with the one who invested least playing first in the next round. The player who invested most gets first pick of the assets (clues, machinery, and victory points) collected by the venture.<br/><br/>Another source of VPs are the theories a player can publish. A theory consists of two or more clues joined together. A complete theory is any size rectangle (2xY) while a partial theory is any other assembly of clue pieces. Publishing a theory during the game consists of a player revealing one or more new clue pieces to form a new theory, or revealing one ore more new clue pieces and reinterpreting the clues of the same colour in an existing public theory (theirs or another players) in order to form a new theory. Clues that don&rsquo;t make it into the new theory cost the player points. The first clue played of any given colour are worth bonus points. Adjacent clues of the same colour within a theory are worth additional points. Complete theories earn a player 2 points per clue, excluding blank ones - incomplete ones earn a player 1 point per clue, including blank ones.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "3", "boardgameversion": {"70730": "Prototype edition"}, "age": "10", "name": "Oak Island", "playingtime": "60", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "boardgamefamily": {"4705": "Games by the Game Artisans of Canada"}}, "85602": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Flip's Twisted World", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"70731": "North American Wii edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2161": "Action Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4441": "Wii"}, "poll": {}, "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Flip&rsquo;s Twisted World is a platform-puzzle game for the Nintendo Wii.

So you would have thought that the classes that best interface with this natural environment would be very popular indeed. Characters for whom waking up is done to bird song, and climate and weather are living beings to be treated with respect. There is nothing more powerful and destructive than nature roused - the tornado, the earthquake, the drought or even a flood, nature is the most powerful force of all.<br/><br/>No one can ever be said to have mastered nature, or at least say it and it be true. But there are a number of classes who are closer to nature than others - rangers, druids, and barbarians. Each in their own way is a &lsquo;Master Survivor&rsquo; but all share a common understanding: nature is a harsh mistress and it takes a special sort of person to live comfortably with such a mistress. These people are masters of the wild not by bending it to their<br/>will but by adapting to it, by living with rather than against nature.<br/><br/>Lost in civilization&rsquo;s cocoon, it is a foolish man who forgets that these wild men are somehow less than they are. Many a cruel warlord has been defeated when they forgot that nature is a terrible enemy.

The year is 1870 and the Industrial Revolution occurred decades earlier than in our own world. Technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable, which has led to the development of fantastic naval vessels, hulking land ships and terror from the skies in the form of airships and war balloons.<br/><br/>Dystopian Wars is designed to ensure a fun game with a large selection of models in a couple of hours. We are big fans of Steam Punk and Victoriana, so we jumped at the chance of creating a naval warfare game along similar lines to our Uncharted Seas and Firestorm Armada games - but encapsulating these interesting genres. Dystopian Wars incorporates Naval, Aerial and Land Models from the outset, so that you can set up battles and scenarios in any combat setting. Games can be played in each genre of warfare OR using a combination of ALL models.<br/><br/>Spartan Games will supply highly detailed, high quality resin and metal miniatures with which you can roam the high seas, scour the smog filled skies of Dystopian Wars for enemy flying ships, or doggedly defend the cities and countryside of your home nation. These three branches of the military use the same core rules for movement and combat, with varying abilities and statistics.<br/><br/>Our fast play rules are optimised for large fleet actions, so you can get as many miniatures on the table as you want, and still get an enjoyable game in one evening. Dystopian Wars is also ideal for multiplayer games, because you get to activate individual squadrons of miniatures from one player to the next. The rules allow for the use of a deck of 52 Game Cards that add an exciting element of randomness to each game. You can play without them, but they improve the overall game play and inject some additional eccentric Victorian atmosphere.<br/><br/>Dystopian Wars is our third game to be built using our D6-based core rules engine and shares elements with the science fiction space combat of Firestorm Armada and the fantasy naval combat of the Uncharted Seas. Dystopian Wars builds on the same successful game ethos.<br/><br/>We are excited about the development of Dystopian Wars - it is an entertaining and violent game, putting you in command of huge Land Vessels, Giant Robots, Impressive Airships and Rugged Naval Ships. Your strategies and choices of fleet construction determine the margin of your victories or defeat. Whether you choose to focus on land, sea or in the air, you have every choice available to you to outmanoeuvre, harass and destroy your opponent.<br/><br/>You command one of the great imperial powers of Dystopian Wars, you can defend your territories from foreign incursion, or you can conquer the world.

Growing threats along the borders of several systems necessitated that this new design enter production as quickly as possible, bypassing the usual research and development (R&amp;D) phase usually associated with new ships. Several ship builders were invited to submit designs for this new contract, titled XG-203. In the end, the Lockdyne corporation received the production contract as none of the other participants could meet the tight production and IOC (Initial Operational Capability) for the first squadron of ships. Lockdyne had been able to meet this timetable by utilizing an off-the shelf approach to many of the ship&rsquo;s systems and basing the design on the commercially successful C-477 cargo ship. The original contract called for a vessel that would incorporate the new Bruning PPC-4 Plasma Pulse Cannon in addition to the usual compliment of energy weapons and missile batteries. Lockdyne engineers realized that the new ship would essentially be &lsquo;built around&rsquo; this new weapon due to its massive size. By making modifications to the existing C-477 design they were able to meet the IOC requirement and bring the project in under budget. Changes to the C-477 design included moving the cockpit right of center to make room for the PPC-4 cannon and related equipment and the addition of &ldquo;wings&rdquo; to accommodate the experimental dual Speer XM33 burst guns which were ordered into production for this contract. The XM33 design had not finished its testing when production was ordered, and the design still had one major flaw to overcome. The weapon delivered the expected energy output, but the gun itself emitted a short surge or radiation each time it was fired. To overcome this the decision was made to mount the guns at the ends of two &ldquo;wings&rdquo; that would give the necessary distance to protect the crew from any hazards associated with the guns use. The engineers saw an opportunity with these new structures and proceeded to incorporate a new Lockdyne design for magnetic shield emitters into the wing structures. This new design proved highly effective and may be utilized in future Lockdyne ships. The first ship served as the sole prototype/test craft, and after just a month of trial runs full production proceeded on schedule. The production vessel was designated the G-203. While some minor improvements have been introduced throughout the production, no sub-designator has been issued for the design. An advanced version is rumored to be in development by the Lockdyne Corporation.<br/><br/>"}, "85667": {"rpgitemversion": {"70827": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Shrike Class Fighters", "rpgproducer": {"20791": "Tom Tullis"}, "rpg": {"305": "d20 Modern"}, "usersrated": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"162": "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpgseries": {"8063": "Starship Tech"}, "average": "0", "description": "From Introduction:<br/><br/>The Shrike family of small single pilot fighters was originally born out of the need for an airframe designed around the Lockdyne HSSSM (High Speed Ship to Ship Missile) project. The specifications for the Lockdyne missile required a specialized single pilot ship be constructed for use during the test phase of the missile. The missile was a failure and the contract was awarded to Argonaut Industries. The fighter prototype proved extremely capable and further testing was requested by the military along with funding for three additional prototypes, each with a slight design variation for different operational requirements within the fleet. The original prototype (now designated the Shrike Mk. I) was reconfigured as a structural testbed and was subsequently destroyed in a flight test accident when a fuel line ruptured and the onboard fire suppression system failed to operate forcing the emergency ejection of the pilot. Five months after the initial go ahead the three prototypes were unveiled (designated Shrike Mk. II, III &amp; IV) and testing began immediately. The Mk. II was a straight ship-to-ship dogfighter. The Mk. III was a two-seat modification to allow for the inclusion of a second crew member to operate the newly developed class IIISR sensor system. The Mk. IV ironically was a slightly modified version of the original prototype capable of carrying the Argonaut Industries HSSSM-12 (the missile selected by the military over the Lockdyne designed HSSSM missile). Each prototype performed beyond expectations and full production commenced after only 170 days of testing. With only minor changes made for the production versions, the new fighters entered service one year later with IOC (Initial Operational Capability) reached after just two years from the beginning of full scale production.<br/><br/>"}, "85668": {"rpg": {"305": "d20 Modern"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Counter Collection: Supers and Modern", "rpgproducer": {"3": "(Uncredited)"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic831748.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"70828": "PDF version"}, "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"171": "Action / Adventure (Superheroes)"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "rpgseries": {"5080": "Counter Collection"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic831748_t.jpg", "description": "user summary<br/><br/>A collection of counters for use with both superhero and modern themed games.<br/><br/>"}, "85669": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Battle Flag TCG", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "1", "boardgamemechanic": {"2040": "Hand Management"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "14", "maxplayers": "1", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic836105_t.jpg", "average": "5.39286", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"4": {"name": "(Self-Published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic836105.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"70829": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1048": {"name": "American Civil War"}}, "age": "10", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Solo American civil war card game.

The game is set around Sissel, a man who wakes up to the unfortunate realization that he is dead and that he has no idea how he died. While coming to grips with his newly freed ghost form, Sissel discovers that he can travel back in time up to four minutes before a person&rsquo;s death and change the events that caused it. He decides to use his powers to prevent others from suffering a fate similar to his own.<br/><br/>Gameplay is innovative in that Sissel cannot interact directly with any of the people he is trying to help. He can, however, indirectly affect them by animating the objects around them in order to prevent their deaths. There are over 100 objects to interact with in the game. Each stage provides a recently deceased person, and the player must rewind to before the death and prevent it before the four minutes expire.<br/><br/>"}, "85684": {"rpg": {"2791": "Pathfinder System Compatible Product"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "The War of the Goblin King", "rpgproducer": {"36376": "Rosa Gibbons"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic832115.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"70876": "PDF Version"}, "average": "6", "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic832115_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Can you Defeat the Goblin King?<br/><br/>Find out in this action-packed adventure, in which the PCs take on the role of the heroes of Springdale, defending that idyllic trading town from ravaging goblin hordes, led by Yarrick, the self-proclaimed &quot;Goblin King&quot; who, in an unholy alliance with a trio of greater barghests, has been laying waste to a number of human settlements.

After Kick Off 2 Dino Dini signed a contract for Virgin Games and later games in the Kick Off series are developed by Steve Screech.<br/><br/>Anco published the first versions of Kick Off for the Amiga and Atari ST  and it was immediately considered a pioneer of soccer computer games, thanks to the new original features never included in a football game before.<br/><br/>With Kick Off, contrary to all its predecessors, the ball did not stick to the player's feet, but instead was realistically kicked ahead from the players. This added an important degree of difficulty and skill requirement at the same time. This, along with all the new original features like action replays, players with different characteristics, different tactics, fouls, yellow cards, red cards, injuries, injury time and various referees with different moods, made Kick Off and especially its successor, Kick Off 2, one of the most successful football game series ever. Kick Off enthusiasts still play tournaments on original Amiga computers every year.<br/><br/>Even though versions for other computers followed, the Atari ST and especially the Amiga versions were by far the most popular.

In the Budokan, the player faces consecutive opponents equipped with various weapons (including, but not limited to, those available to the player). The difficulty gradually increases, with each opponent demonstrating increasing prowess when compared to the previous. Most opponents are male, except for one female armed with a naginata. The gender of a ninjutsu fighter with a masked face is presumedly female, as they are named Ayako.<br/><br/>Each match is preceded by a briefing screen which provides the player with several words about the opponent. Based on this information (and past experience playing the game), the player then chooses which weapon to use in the upcoming conflict. Since each weapon can only be used in a limited number of matches, an overall strategy or plan is necessary in order to successfully defeat all opponents.<br/><br/>There are two primary attributes shown on the screen -- stamina and ki, the power of each blow. Active movements like jumping and delivering difficult blows decrease the ki, while blocking attacks increases ki. As a player's stamina decreases, movements slow down, making it more and more difficult to act. When the player's (or his opponent's) stamina is completely exhausted, the match ends. This makes the game much more strategic than many contemporary fighting games, as it is impossible to &quot;button mash&quot; one's way to victory.

It is hailed as the greatest of the Road Rash series by many.<br/><br/>The races took place in the U.S. states of Alaska, Hawaii, Tennessee, Arizona, and Vermont, on progressively longer two-lane roads. Races would be won by placing first, second, or third in each of the five tracks (as opposed to the first game, which would allow a victory by placing fourth as well). After all five tracks were won, the player would advance to the next level, where the track would be longer, the opponents faster, and much more money at stake for a victory or a loss.<br/><br/>The second Road Rash game introduced two major features to gameplay. One is the fighting system and the addition of a second weapon&mdash;the chain. Where in the first game one strong hit would deplete the opponent's life bar, in this game each weapon's attacks dealt a set amount of damage. The other main addition to gameplay is of bikes containing nitrous oxide injection, which allows the user's motorcycle to accelerate beyond its top speed for a short amount of time.

Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors; or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.<br/><br/>A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players must take this into account when they choose what to buy.<br/><br/>Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. On their turn, players may choose to visit either the dungeon or the village. Plays can purchase other cards for their deck or level up their heroes in the village. If they instead go to the dungeon, they play their heroes, weapons, items, and spells to defeat any one of the available monsters. The deeper the monster is in the dungeon, the more light is needed or the monster will gain power. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/><br/>Thunderstone returns with Dragonspire! Featuring all-new art for every card (even Militia and Daggers), experience point tokens (not cards!), and the all new &quot;Setting&quot; cards which alter the game on a global scale.

Thus, if an 8th level fighter were to don the complete set of armour, many of the most extraordinary features would be beyond his grasp.

With the Red Falcon alien threat defeated and Alien Wars finished, the Earth is peaceful once again. However, a similar alien entity calling itself Black Viper begins launching attacks against the human race, causing mass destruction over the planet. After strange readings are detected at the Galuga archipelago (the setting of the original Contra), the Earth Federation sends their four strongest Contra Force commandos on a final strike mission to destroy the Black Viper and its army of aliens, robots, and mutants.<br/><br/>Contra 4 is based on the same 2D gameplay system featured in the series through Contra III: The Alien Wars, ignoring many of the game mechanics introduced in later games such as the fixed weapon configurations in Contra: Shattered Soldier and Neo Contra, returning to the old method of picking up power-up icons to obtain new weapons. The play controls are similar to Contra III, including the ability to hold two weapons in inventory. The action spans both screens of the Nintendo DS system and a grappling hook can be used by the player's character to latch onto railings, allowing the player's character to move from one screen to the other. Similarly to the arcade version of Super Contra, the player can pick up the same power-up twice, giving them an improved version of the same weapon. The player can also discard a power-up, allowing them to try out a new weapon without losing a previous one, or give the power-up to another player.<br/><br/>In addition to the standard side view stages, there are also tunnel stages similar to the two &quot;3D view&quot; stages from the original Contra, in which the perspective shifts behind the character's back. The action in these stages is displayed solely on the upper screen, while the bottom screen is used to display the stage's map and the locations of power-ups. Other than using both screens and two-card ad hoc cooperative play, Contra 4 makes no usage of the DS' special features such as touch screen (besides navigating the main menu), microphone, or single card multiplayer.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Contra 4,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "85952": {"statistics": {}, "name": "SRAM", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"71366": "French/English/German Amstrad CPC edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic844977.jpg", "videogameseries": {"8108": "SRAM"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "usersrated": "2", "average": "7.5", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"5203": "Amstrad CPC"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic844977_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>SRAM is a graphical text adventure game by Serge Hauduc, Ludovic Hauduc and Jacques Hemonic.
