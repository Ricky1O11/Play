The Board Game is a digitally-enhanced boardgame set in the Zombies, Run! universe.

The map shows nearby towns, forests, farms, along with vital information about the location of zombies, supplies, and other settlements. Working together, the players embark on missions across the map, searching for supplies, rescuing survivors, and investigating the cause of the outbreak.<br/><br/>But danger is never far away, with our unique real-time &quot;running&quot; card mechanic forcing players to use all their skill, nerve and co-ordination to survive. Will they reach their destination safely, or will they fall prey to the pursuing undead?<br/><br/>During a mission, the players act as &ldquo;Runners&rdquo; sent out by Abel. Our companion iPhone/Android app uses audio and on-screen prompts to immerse the players in the game and story - informing them of threats, opportunities and events. Players can choose to investigate these, finding life-saving supplies, new storylines, or perhaps a hidden horde of zombies!<br/><br/>Uniquely, players must react to situations in real-time, making tough decisions as the pursuing horde draws closer.<br/><br/>The missions they choose and the decisions they make will constantly transform the game world and map. Settlements become overrun with the living dead and must be crossed out on the map, or marked with warnings. Hidden trails are found, opening new paths to explore and new secrets to uncover. Reports are heard on the radio of hordes moving in from the East - but how close, and how fast?

The game features three multiplayer modes: &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Melee&quot;, and &quot;Slammageddon&quot;.<br/>In &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, the object of the game is to stay atop of a hill the longest, while opponents try and knock each other off. The first player to reach 30 points wins. The longer the player stay on the hill, the more points she/he receive. In &quot;Melee&quot;, the objective is to earn as many slam points within a 2-minute time period. For attack, a word bank that says &quot;Slam&quot; will fill up. Once the bank has filled up, the player can unleash a Slam Attack which can hit multiple opponents. For each opponent who's hit, the player will receive a Slam Point, but if a player get slammed, they'll lose one. The player with the most slam points after the time limit stops wins. In &quot;Slammageddon&quot;, each single attack counts as a Slam. But, if a player manage to get a 'Max Slam Juice' potion in Slammageddon match and hit the opponent(s) with your slam, nothing happens.<br/>Every character has a &quot;Slam&quot; attack. Slams all have different effects.

(EA)"], "description": "The game's story is a prequel to the events of Def Jam Vendetta. However, the game uses many of the same situations and characters from Fight for NY, which is the third game in the series, chronologically. The player is still a nameless up-and-coming young street fighter brought into the world of underground street fighting after rescuing one of the game's personalities from trouble with the police. However, instead of D-Mob being freed from police custody, like in Fight for NY, it is tattoo artist Manny who is saved from corrupt police officers. Manny takes the player to gang leader O.G., who becomes his &quot;mentor&quot;, who instructs him in how to fight to gain control of (take over) the five boroughs of New York City. Eventually, O.G. is murdered by Crow, leaving D-Mob to step in and use the player as his number one fighter. Ultimately, it is revealed that D-Mob was using the player to take over the five boroughs, controlling New York City's underground, and that he was going to leave the player to take the fall, leading the police to his exact whereabouts. After defeating D-Mob in the story's final battle, a one-on-one fight at the 125th Street Subway Station, the player decides to leave the underground fight scene for good. It is safe to say that, since this is a prequel story, D-Mob recovers from the fight and, with nobody in New York to stop him, builds his empire that is seen in Vendetta.<br/><br/>Character creation is still the same as Fight for NY. Just like in the original, only male characters can be created. You still create your character using the same type of police sketch-artist system. A new addition is choosing your character's home town from one of the five boroughs of New York City. From there, the game flows similarly to Fight for NY, featuring many of the same fighting arenas and shops with which to upgrade your character's clothing, jewelry, hair, and fighting moves.<br/><br/>The story is no longer told through fully voiced cutscenes. For The Takeover, the story progresses through text and messages received on your character's Sidekick.<br/><br/>Also, since the game uses many of the graphical assets seen in 2004's Fight for NY, it does not reflect physical changes seen in some of the celebrities featured in the game. For example, Busta Rhymes, in the role of Magic, still has his dreadlock hairstyle, which he cut in late 2005. Also, Ludacris still has his cornrow hairstyle, which he would cut in the summer of 2006.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;<a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_Jam_Fight_for_NY' rel='nofollow'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_Jam_Fight_for_NY</a>:_The_Takeover,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "203133": {"poll": [], "name": "The Pinball Arcade: Season 2", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK PlayStation 4 edition"], "average": "10", "videogametheme": ["Minigame Compilation"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["FarSight Studios"], "videogamegenre": ["Pinball"], "videogameplatform": ["PlayStation 4"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["System 3"], "videogamecompilation": ["Table Pack 11: Dr. Dude and His Excellent Ray and Firepower", "Table Pack 12: Cactus Canyon and Central Park", "Table Pack 13: White Water and Space Shuttle", "Table Pack 14: Centaur and Pin\u2022Bot", "Table Pack 15: The Champion Pub and Whirlwind", "Table Pack 16: Flight 2000 and Goin' Nuts", "Table Pack 17: Terminator 2: Judgment Day", "Table Pack 18: Haunted House and Tee'd Off", "Table Pack 19: Class of 1812 and Victory", "Table Pack 20: Cue Ball Wizard and El Dorado City of Gold"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>All the table packs from Season 2 of The Pinball Arcade are available here on a physical disc release.

As you arrive, you discover you are not alone. Some people are family you recognize, others you don't. The door opens and you all enter. The door locks behind you. A spectral form of Alphie greets you and informs you he is stuck in an interplanar portal. He needs your help to be saved. All you have to do is make your way through his mansion to his laboratory and pull him out. He promises to share his wealth and knowledge with whomever among you can reach him first.<br/><br/>The Mansion of Mana is a sequential set collection, unique power, engine building light-strategic game with a modular game board. In the Mansion of Mana, each player represents a distant relative of Uncle Alphie who are attempting to earn their fortune and knowledge by helping to save him. Players navigate the mansion- collecting runic elements, playing them sequentially to acquire keys, to enter new rooms in the mansion. With each room entered, a new ability is gained allowing each player to become quicker at acquiring the runes to enter more rooms or to slow others down who would beat you to the objective of saving Uncle Alphie.<br/><br/>The Mansion of Mana gives players a medium to light weight strategic game in a small box. Player's seek to get through the mansion as quickly as possible while engine-building their special abilities to gain more cards, hold more cards, add more options, steal from other players, or allow them to bend the rules in their favor. The Mansion of Mana is strongly strategic with the only elements of luck in the cards available to draw from (similar to Ticket to Ride). However, every player has a hand limit, so you cannot save up your cards, but you can play them on the table, partially completed, and add to them. However, watch out! Someone could steal from your partially completed set.<br/><br/>Will you efficiently navigate the Mansion? or will you prey off of those who would be so careless to leave their runes in the open? Or perhaps you will Unlock the secrets of the mansion to find your way to Uncle Alphie and achieve victory!<br/><br/>"}, "203171": {"poll": [], "name": "Job Island: Hard Working People", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["UK Wii edition"], "average": "5", "videogametheme": ["Minigame Compilation"], "usersrated": "1", "videogamedeveloper": ["Hudson Soft"], "videogamegenre": ["Management"], "videogameplatform": ["Wii"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Hudson Soft"], "description": "USer summary: Take on 55 jobs including Security Guard, Sushi Chef, Plane Cleaner, Haunted House Monster, Body-builder and Sumo Referee.

Some of its key features include:<br/><br/>THE SHEPHERDS<br/>The Shepherds are powerful hero units that you unlock and customize. Each has an ability kit containing three regular abilities and an ultimate ability. Shepherds gain experience and level-up during combat, and with each level comes a skill point that can be spent to upgrade one of the Shepherd's abilities. Skillful use and customization of Shepherd abilities is critical to overcoming your opponents' defenses and defeating them.<br/><br/>ITEMS<br/>If your opponents has set up a good counter to your Shepherds and their abilities, however, you can also equip your Shepherds with powerful items. Some items provide passive bonuses, like increased armor or health regeneration, while other items can be used actively to give buffs or one-time consumable effects.<br/><br/>&quot;MAZING&quot;<br/>&quot;Mazing&quot; is the art of filling a wide-open space in a tower defense game with your towers to build the longest possible path (the maze) that the enemy's units must travel before reaching your throne. &quot;Mazing&quot; is a core skill in Shepherds of the Abyss, and it's put to the test with random obstacles spawned each game to prevent you from memorizing the strongest maze setup.<br/><br/>EMPOWERING TOWERS<br/>When Towers deal damage to units, you gain a resource called Rage. Rage can be spent to cast a spell that Empowers the targeted tower, which causes it to unleash its true potential. Some towers may then gain a snare, shred armor, freeze units in place, or deal significantly more damage. The Empowered state is unique for each tower, and considering each tower's full potential is critical in deciding where to place them.<br/><br/>CURRENT FEATURES<br/><br/>     3 Shepherds (hero units)<br/>     Items that can be purchased during matches and equipped on Shepherd units, including passive and activatable items <br/>     12 Attack Towers with different firing mechanics and positional strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique Empowered states <br/>     1v1 map and mode <br/>     Tutorial missions <br/>     Single Player vs AI (the AI is a work in progress) <br/>     Single Player Wave Survival mode<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>ON THE HORIZON<br/><br/>     Additional Shepherds<br/>     Additional Items<br/>     Additional game modes<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>"}, "203191": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3460834.jpg", "poll": [], "boardgamedesigner": ["Eric Bittermann"], "statistics": [], "yearpublished": "2017", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": ["Caravan Studios", "Jason Nguyen", "David Yanchick"], "boardgamepublisher": ["Sky Kingdom Games"], "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3460834_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": ["Card Game", "Dice", "Fantasy", "Wargame"], "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Centuries have passed since the great city of Lux disappeared into the sky.

The hero cards are offered in 4 different languages: English, German, French and Dutch. The playing cards are language independant and are valued 0 to 7. The cards with value 3 and 4 in each suit are magical spells. Each suit also has one card marked as a potion, the value being different in each suit. These special cards offer special gameplay effects, depending on which hero is chosen in a round. The other playing cards show typical dungeon inhabitants. These become relevant with a few heroes that are in the game.<br/><br/>Players compete over multiple rounds to accumulate the most gold and the player who ends up with the most gold wins the game. There are 3 sets of 5 unique heroes and each game a set of 5 heroes is chosen to play with. Every round one of the players acts as the active player and has to choose one of 5 available heroes. Each hero changes the game and describes how gold is earned. All the other players have to cooperate and try to stop the active player from reaching this goal.<br/><br/>The active player chooses the hero to play with after the playing cards are dealt. In a 4 player game each player receives 7 cards. The remaining 4 cards are set aside. After the active player has chosen the hero for the round, that player may exchange up to 4 cards from hand with the remaining cards. In a 2 and 3 player game each player is dealt 9 cards and 5 cards are set aside and available for exchanging.<br/><br/>Each hero determines the goal for the active player how gold can be earned. This can be a scaling amount of gold. For example if a player chooses the Barbarian gold is earned for every collected trick and potion card above a certain threshold. Some heroes offer a fixed amount of gold. For example, if a player chooses the Assassin, 4 gold is earned if the active player wins the final trick of the round. When the active player did not manage to earn any gold, all other players are rewarded for their good cooperation by earning 1 gold each. Some heroes change the game in other ways, for example playing cards without revealing them or making use of the set aside cards during a round.<br/><br/>The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. The first played card of a trick determines the suit that is asked. Other players must follow suit, if they can. In general the player who played highest card of the suit that is requested, wins the trick. Some heroes add trump cards that round, this can be a suit, one of the special cards (magical spells, potions) or even a specific number. If one or more trump cards is played in a trick, the highest trump wins the trick. Each suit is ranked (1 to 4), if multiple trump cards of the same value are played (e.g. multiple 4's with a hero in play that makes them trump), the higher ranked suit wins the trick.<br/><br/>The three sets of five heroes each offer a range of options for players. Starting players are recommended to play with set A first. Sets B and C offering more tricky heroes to play with. Besides these three unique set of hero options, the game also suggests a few variants to increase variability. Instead of playing 2 rounds per player the 'Adventurer's Guild' variant forces players to play once with each of the five heroes that game as an active player. Another variant, 'Random Dungeon', shuffles all the 15 heroes together and the active player is offered 1 hero at random to choose to play with. Up to two times this hero can be refused an a new hero is revealed.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "name": "Tricky Dungeon", "playingtime": "40", "boardgamemechanic": ["Hand Management", "Trick-taking"], "average": "7.75", "usersrated": "2", "age": "12", "boardgamepodcastepisode": ["HLG 15: Geluk &amp; Fillers", "HLG 6: Samen"]}, "203239": {"boardgamedesigner": ["James Colmer"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Rat Rod Race", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Roll / Spin and Move"], "yearpublished": "2016", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3089662_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["James Colmer"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Gremlin Game Studio"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3089662.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": ["Dice", "Miniatures", "Racing"], "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "Rat Rod Race is a unique and fun new board game for all the family. It was designed to provide a more tactile and interactive experience for the players with a retro vintage style to match the theme. The game is a crossover which incorporates elements of traditional board games, card games, racing games and component building.<br/><br/>There are two playing boards in the game, featuring a Junkyard and a Dragstrip.<br/><br/>THE JUNKYARD<br/><br/>Players begin by stocking the junkyard board with all the parts for the Rat Rods. There are 4 disassembled vehicles whose components each have their own area. You choose where to place them.<br/><br/>Once the Junkyard has been stocked, players roll a dice to see who goes first and begin moving their tokens around the board, collecting all the necessary parts to build their vehicles.<br/><br/>There are four male and four female mechanic character tokens, allowing any combination of players. Parts must be collected in order, however players can choose which path to take to reach their favourite ones first. Depending upon which direction a player chooses to take, it will lead them to different types and styles of car parts within each category.<br/><br/>The aim is to get the parts you want first, before the others collect them. Different body types, different engines, blower styles and different wheel designs means loads of possible combinations.<br/><br/>The player that finishes their car first, takes pole position on the Dragstrip Board. As each of the other players finish, they take up the remaining positions in order. Positions on the grid determine the order of turn.<br/><br/>THE DRAGSTRIP<br/><br/>This is where the real race begins.<br/><br/>The highly detailed Dragstrip Board is one of the largest made, with interchangeable sections to make it as short or long as you want. It can be assembled to almost 3m in length.<br/><br/>The road ahead is filled with potential dangers, with an extra element where players get to place hazard cones at strategic locations to try and stop the other players from winning the race. Every time a player lands on a road hazard or cone, they draw an action card from the deck which could delay them, send them back or forward, or other unexpected outcomes.<br/><br/>Potential hazards along the way include potholes, radar traps, toxic chemical spills, oil slicks, loose car parts, and even quake damage. Remember too, that this is the Extraterrestrial Highway...so you never know what you might encounter during the race.<br/><br/>Every time a player lands on a Hazard space, they take a card from the Action deck. Sometimes it's good news, sometimes it's bad!<br/><br/>There are 30 different Action Cards included in the game, with a little humour thrown in, and all with a unique Retro look.<br/><br/>We also wanted to bring back the old school fun of a game spinner, so we've designed a custom &quot;Speed Dial&quot; which has multiple 10, 20 and 30 MPH markings on it. Each of these correspond with the gear you are in, 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, and players move one to three spaces accordingly.<br/><br/>"}, "203240": {"poll": [], "name": "Bullet Force", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Military"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Shooter"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Bullet Force is a multiplayer first-person shooter featuring weapon customization, satisfying gunplay, 20-player servers, multiple gamemodes, and more.<br/><br/>"}, "203241": {"poll": [], "name": "Kingspray Graffiti Simulator", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Art"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Simulation"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "Kingspray is a graffiti simulator for the HTC Vive.

Gorechosen gives you the chance! This brand-new boxed game from Games Workshop lets four players slug it out for brutal supremacy in brutal pit fights. The box includes four plastic multi-part Citadel miniatures: the Exalted Deathbringer of Khorne, the Skullgrinder, the Slaughterpriest and the Aspiring Deathbringer with Goreaxe and Skullhammer &ndash; four iconic champions of Khorne.<br/><br/>The game itself is a simple, cunning and laugh-out-loud mix of subtle strategy and straightforward brutal combat, and four players can play through a game in about an hour. 24 action cards let your chosen fighter pick from a variety of painful attacks and gambits (our favourite being the humble Shove, should your victim happen to be standing next to one of the fire pits present on the game&rsquo;s board) while 16 injury cards present, in gruesome detail, the inevitable results of standing in a spiked pit with three other crazed madmen. And the fun doesn&rsquo;t stop with the feuding &ndash; players who have been knocked out can still influence the game thanks to special Fate of the Slain rules. Full rules for these fighters are presented on four fighter sheets, and rules for four more (with miniatures available separately from Games Workshop) are included inside the game&rsquo;s rulebook.<br/><br/>Each fighter has a unique Kill Zone which dictates what they can hit, and how powerfully. The Slaughterpriest in the box, for example, has enormous reach forwards with his axe (because it&rsquo;s flipping massive) but is weaker when to the sides. (You can imagine an overhead chop, rather than a sweep around him.) Each fighter also keeps track of his wrath using the Wrath Track. Wrath can be spent to make actions, and is usually accrued when fighters are wounded &ndash; injury cards, which are received when combatants are damaged, affect wrath in this way.<br/><br/>Wrath also has an effect on who goes first, because the angrier fighters are, the more chance there is they will act first! Each turn, fighters put in a number of initiative cards equal to their wrath (each player has a unique design of initiative card), then the top initiative card is turned over, dictating who will act. After that player has made an action, the next initiative card is turned over, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["English edition", "French edition", "German edition"], "maxplaytime": "75", "name": "Gorechosen", "playingtime": "75", "boardgamemechanic": ["Deck / Pool Building", "Dice Rolling", "Grid Movement", "Take That"], "average": "7.40564", "usersrated": "165", "boardgamefamily": ["Warhammer Fantasy Board Games"]}, "203271": {"rpgartist": ["Shutterstock.com"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Yet 10 More HQ Add-Ons...

The rules say to place all the letters in a box from which players draw blind.<br/><br/>In the Game of Words, players draw one tile at a time. The first two players put their letters on the centre of the table, forming a pool. Each turn thereafter, a player tries to use the letter in his hand to form a word from the letters in the pool. If he succeeds, the word is placed in front of him. Players may use their letters to add to another word to create a new, longer one, and &quot;capture&quot; that word from another player. They also may add their letter to one of their own words. Letters in a word may be rearranged. Unplayable letters are added to the pool. Players draw a new tile to end their turn.

However, any GM interested in kicking off a new campaign will find this adventure a great starting point.<br/><br/>As citizens of Last Hope, the player characters find themselves drawn into a tangled plot that involves the efforts of a scoundrel working to pilfer a valuable relic from the local temple and the mayor&rsquo;s disgraced son who has been dabbling in dark magic. As the characters investigate the plot, they must find ways to work together and overcome the myriad challenges in their path. If they succeed, they will forge the bonds of friendship and the trust they need to carry them on to even greater adventures.<br/><br/>"}, "203299": {"boardgamedesigner": ["John Poniske"], "average": "0", "poll": [], "name": "Battle of Belmont", "playingtime": "240", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": ["Chit-Pull System", "Dice Rolling", "Hex-and-Counter", "Simulation"], "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3159498_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": ["Rick Barber", "Bill Morgal"], "statistics": [], "boardgamepublisher": ["Compass Games"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3159498.jpg", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "maxplaytime": "240", "boardgamecategory": ["American Civil War"], "age": "12", "minplaytime": "180", "description": "On November 6th, 1861, rebels in Columbus, Kentucky, celebrated the election of President Jefferson Davis. That same day, General Ulysses S. Grant moved against General Polk on the opposite side of the Mississippi. This was to be Grant's first aggressive action of the war. Grant landed 3,000 men, supported by artillery and cavalry two miles southeast of the Confederate Camp Johnson and the tiny village of Belmont. Correctly identifying the gathering smoke from Grant&rsquo;s little fleet, Polk still vacillated before dispatching General Pillow and four Tennessee Regiments to reinforce General Tappan&rsquo;s Arkansans on the Missouri side of the river. U.S. Commander Walke led his gunboats into a brief artillery battle with the Iron Banks batteries but soon withdrew his battered vessels. By 8;30 a.m. Grant marched on the rebel Camp. By 10:00 am the battle commenced.<br/><br/>Soldiers fought across heavy woods, clear fields and cornfields. Pillow showed poor judgement. In short order his demoralized men retreated north and south of their camp while the Yankees celebrated their victory. Grant briefly lost control. His officers and men ignored him as they looted the abandoned camp. General McClernand even took time to mount a stump and give a political speech. Finally roused to action, Polk ordered his Iron banks batteries to fire on Camp Johnson as General Cheatham and five additional regiments shuttled across the river. Exposed Union companies were decimated by the re-energized confederates. Many Northerners had their retreat cut off. The fight continued all the way back to the ships. Grant found himself the last man aboard.<br/><br/>Belmont&rsquo;s butcher bill left 320 Union dead, 400 wounded &ndash; 100 of whom were captured along with another 100 healthy men. The confederates lost 105 killed, 419 wounded and 117 missing. Despite the casualties the battle was ultimately inconclusive and both sides claimed victory. Grant captured and destroyed an enemy camp but at a horrendous cost. On the other hand, Polk and Pillow showed hesitation and poor judgement something Grant would use against them in later battles. The rebels had forced Grant and his Yankees to quit the field only after he had created a core of skilled veterans displaying the courage and determination eventually to earn him command of all the Union forces.<br/><br/>Belmont is to be a COMPASS, PAPER WARS Magazine game based on John Poniske's Ball's Bluff design &hellip; significantly expanded.

The game features individual cards deck for each side, two thirds of which contain events. The card decks are adjusted from year to year to reflect the historical progression of the war. The regional nature of much of the conflict is recreated using a system of Leader and Regional blocks as well as rules for regionally-based recruitment. The usual block game mechanics for field battles have been modified with special rules for artillery, cavalry and infantry, while a completely new system has been designed for storming and sieges.<br/><br/>While the Parliamentarians start the game with a slight advantage in terms of control of cities, the Royalist have both higher quality troops and more cavalry. However, the Parliamentarians will receive more reinforcements during the game as the Covenanters become allies, while the creation of the New Model Army will both improve the quality of their forces and increase their strategic flexibility. The object of the game is to acquire Victory Points through the capture of cities held by the opponent. In addition, the Parliamentarians can move closer to victory by capturing the King, represented by his own block.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": ["First edition"], "average": "7.28571", "name": "This War Without an Enemy", "playingtime": "300", "boardgamemechanic": ["Area Movement", "Campaign / Battle Card Driven", "Dice Rolling", "Secret Unit Deployment", "Simulation"], "age": "12", "usersrated": "7", "boardgamesubdomain": ["Wargames"], "boardgamefamily": ["Block wargames", "Country: England", "English Civil War"]}, "203322": {"poll": [], "name": "Mistfal", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Horror"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Visual Novel"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Interactive novel, survival horror, and psychological thriller.<br/><br/>"}, "203323": {"poll": [], "name": "Ridge", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Other"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["(Self-Developed Video Game)"], "videogamegenre": ["Walking Simulator"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["(Self-Published)"], "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of ruthless and frightening world of Ridge.<br/><br/>"}, "203324": {"poll": [], "name": "In Case of Emergency, Release Raptor", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Prehistoric"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["Arcen Games, LLC"], "videogamegenre": ["Action Adventure"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["Arcen Games, LLC"], "description": "When the machines rule with an iron fist, it's time to unleash the raptors!<br/><br/>Source: The Game Website.<br/><br/>After weak initial sales, Arcen completely removed Release Raptor from sale, essentially scrapping development and promising full refunds to all previous buyers.<br/><br/>"}, "203325": {"poll": [], "name": "Umineko When They Cry", "videogamemode": ["Single-Player"], "videogameversion": ["Windows Downloadable edition"], "average": "0", "videogametheme": ["Anime", "Detective / Mystery"], "usersrated": "0", "videogamedeveloper": ["07th Expansion"], "videogamegenre": ["Visual Novel"], "videogameplatform": ["Windows"], "statistics": [], "videogamepublisher": ["MangaGamer"], "description": "Umineko When They Cry is the 2nd series of Sound Novel released by 07th Expansion.

There are three broad ways to win: attack aggressively to make players discard faster, play defensively and wait for the opportune time to make moves, and trick opponents with dangerous traps and combos.<br/><br/>Players can only play five cards at a time. They must discard a card from their hand every turn. All cards consume energy, and players must decide how to allocate energy use since stronger and more versatile cards use more energy. Cards can be played facedown and turned face-up at any time. When turned facedown to face-up, card effects immediately take place, giving the player the element of surprise. Facedown cards do not use energy, allowing players to save energy until needed.<br/><br/>War Co. is a dystopian sci-fi game set in the year 2796. After three hundred years with no war, most weapon manufacturing corporations had been restructured or dissolved. Only one global weapon producer had survived the Era of Peace &ndash; the War Machines Company. Isolated skirmishes evolved into the War of 2620, and the War Machines Company profited by selling dangerous machines and technologies to wounded societies. Both of the multinational governments, in an attempt to preserve their own residents, purchased weapons faster than they could afford to spend money. Eventually, both multinational governments ran out of money and started purchasing the weapons with food, water, land, and sources of energy.

The German player is mainly on the offensive, attempting to win by seizing key areas on map faster than was done historically. The Soviet player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also requires he prosecute almost continuous counteroffensives throughout the game.<br/><br/>Game play encompasses the period that began with the Germans launching their invasion on 22 June and ends on 1 September of the same year. The main thrust of the design is to test Guderian's oft-repeated claim he could've led Army Group Center into Moscow during that time, had he only been allowed by Hitler to run a true blitzkrieg.<br/><br/>The game may end sooner than the historic termination time, if the German player is able to do significantly better than his historic counterpart by advancing so quickly he causes the overall political, social, economic and military collapse of the Soviet Union. Alternatively, if the German player doesn't do well enough soon enough, he may lose the game in that it's then assumed Hitler loses faith in the idea of taking Moscow and instead turns AGC's panzers south to Kiev, just as occurred historically.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents 16 miles (26 km) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with a few units of other sizes. Most German divisions have four steps, while most Soviet units are one-step with unknown strengths upon entry. The effects of the general air superiority enjoyed by the Germans throughout this campaign are built into the movement and combat rules. Each of the nine turns represents one week.

This suggests an early publication by E.I. Horsman, which started as a doll manufacturer in 1865 and by the mid-1880s was having a battle with Milton Bradley over the rights to Halma and was prominently displaying patents and copyrights on its boxes.<br/><br/>The card deck has 48 cards divided into 12 sets of four cards each.

For instance, Poets, Dramatists and Historians form one of the trios. Winning two sets of a trio is worth three points instead of two, and winning all three is worth five points. Individual sets count a single point, but the person with the largest number of sets of any kind gets a two-point bonus.

The spinner is unusual - it has 12 outcomes that include 2 x 0, 3 x 1, 2 x 2, 2 x 3, and one each of 4, 5 and 6. The rules say that after making a spin, each player must move his token that number of spaces, forwards, back or sideways.<br/><br/>The player must add or subtract the number in each space he passes or reaches and keep a cumulative total from one turn to the next. The winner is the first to successfully reach the 66 space of their color with a cumulative total of exactly 66.<br/><br/>A copy of the game from renowned collector Alex G. Malloy's estate includes a hand-written attribution of the cover art to Palmer Cox, the Canadian artist famous for his books and comics about Brownies.

Its mechanics are board-and-card driven with some dice-influenced results; the game flow is controlled by action and reaction cards, dice rolling, hand management, and area influence. A quirky, humorous tone keeps the mood light, despite the deep gameplay.<br/><br/>The game takes place over the final eight weeks of the campaign and concludes with the assignment of electoral votes on Election Night. Each player chooses a candidate they are trying to propel to victory. Play as one of the leading lights of the 2016 campaign, or bring back a proven winner! Some candidates are better at speaking, some bring more skill at fundraising, some are from swing states, and others are simply rich.<br/><br/>Each week is divided into two turns, one for each player, and is affected by an environment card that may temporarily alter the cost or effect of your actions. You&rsquo;ll begin with five action cards, representing various things you can do during that week&rsquo;s campaign, such as uncover a scandal, criticize Cuba, collect an endorsement, or even start a war. You&rsquo;ll also start with five state cards, which determine where you can play your action cards. Each turn gives you the opportunity to draw or purchase new and more powerful action cards, some of which can be combined to extraordinary effect.<br/><br/>Each week you&rsquo;ll spend time and energy visiting swing states, building up influence points that hopefully will lead to winning that state on election night. If you build up enough influence, you&rsquo;ll get momentum in that state, which will make it harder for your opponent to come back&mdash;but be careful; spend too much time in any one place and they&rsquo;ll start to get sick of you.<br/><br/>Have you sold out to major donors to finance your campaign? Of course you have! This gives you money, which you can spend on state or national advertising. Again, this can give you momentum, but you risk overexposure.<br/><br/>You can do all sorts of things in Race to the White House by playing Action Cards. You can come out against the Keystone XL pipeline (if you&rsquo;re a Democrat) or promise more mining permits (if you&rsquo;re a Republican). If your party is in office, you can start a war, or respond to a major natural disaster&mdash;but be careful; either one can backfire badly, and your opponent might have an October Surprise ready. You can cheer for a swing state&rsquo;s baseball team in the World Series, or you can stick your opponent with bad weather. You can uncover a scandal in state government that puts a safe state in play, or you can send hecklers into your opponent&rsquo;s rallies that neutralizes their effects. It feels just as crazy, exciting, and dirty as an actual campaign!<br/><br/>Over the course of eight weeks, you&rsquo;ll build up a strong position in some swing states, and if you&rsquo;ve been smart about it, you&rsquo;ll have managed to play defense and prevent your opponent from doing the same. But you never really know, do you? When election night rolls around, you&rsquo;ll be on the edge of your seat waiting for the networks to call the states in the order that their polls close. Some states will be easy, but others will be too close to call, potentially until early in the morning. If you&rsquo;re behind, do you concede and save some victory points? Or do you hang on until the bitter end?

If the players aren&rsquo;t winning then the game has to restart. Players with overly strict or egotistical GMs end up quitting and sharing tales of caution. However, when things are simply too easy and the game lacks challenge, the players get bored and leave.<br/><br/>While the flavor and core mechanics of Pathfinder are excellent, the challenge rating system, or CR, often falls short of providing the expected challenge. The foundation was built on the mechanics of the Core rules with an assumption of a 15 point buy and 4 player characters. With multiple rule expansions, higher point buys, tables with more than four players or a variety of NPC allies some of which can be basically bought with the Leadership feat: the foundation is crumbling.<br/><br/>Even 4 player groups with a strict GM have to face, new classes, archetypes, feats, spells, and optional rules that has allowed for a level of optimization that the CR system just plain fails measure up against. CR completely falls short against veteran players with even a slight desire to optimize and an experienced hand at approaching the game.<br/><br/>To underline my point all of the following encounters are CR 7.<br/><br/>    A single 9th level human expert<br/>    A single 8th level half-elf sorcerer<br/>    A troll with the half dragon template<br/>    A 5th level cleric/1st level cavalier gnome riding a wolf and leading a group of four level 2 fighter 1/rogue 1&rsquo;s.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The first two encounters can potentially end before the &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; can act if the GM roll poorly on Initiative. Neither experts nor sorcerers have the standard mechanics to makes them particularly high hit point pools and the actions economy of four characters to one is going to make this a speed bump at best.<br/><br/>The third encounter has the potential to challenge simply because trolls have more HP to go around and with the half dragon template a way to damage all foes at once, a way to possibly negate actions (by flying,) multiple attacks in melee, and generally better defenses. The action economy still favors the PCs strongly and against even a 5th level party the outcome of the battle is a foregone conclusion barring unusual die rolls.<br/><br/>The final encounter potentially divides the party&rsquo;s actions and if terrain or preparation favors the bad guys we might actually present a challenge. In the very least we might go more then 1-2 rounds.<br/><br/>Against a veteran group of players with even 4th level characters I&rsquo;d call none of those encounters challenging. Add them together and you have a moderate challenge for a 5th level party of my players. The only worry I&rsquo;d have is if I started rolling hot with the troll. Things get ugly fast when a player falls, the action economy may well shift.<br/><br/>The boring way to fix the problems of CR is to nerf and houserule your players into a box. Yet restrict magic items and lowering point buys just isn&rsquo;t as fun. Pathfinder needs a new scale, one that meets the realities of a GM facing a better class of player. Our solution is APCR!<br/><br/>The APCR or advanced player challenge rating is based off of a few design concepts that experienced GMs have used for years that level the playing field. The $2 General line will give you a masterfully built NPC with a CR and APCR that has that extra kick that will test your optimized players. Each NPC will be complete with minions, something new to toss your veterans a curveball, a sensible yet compelling backstory, and sound tactical advice.<br/><br/>For our first installment we give Diero Domine. Like some of the best villian's he's a dark mirror to some common hero tropes. A peasant Robin Hood magus taking a dark path, he needs to be stopped but he isn't entirely in the wrong.<br/><br/>Capable GMs will definitely get more than one fight out of this one!<br/><br/>"}, "203455": {"rpgartist": ["(Uncredited)"], "rpgitemversion": ["PDF version"], "poll": [], "name": "Charismatic Abilities", "rpgdesigner": ["Ken Pawlik", "Kelly Pawlik"], "rpggenre": ["Fantasy (High Fantasy)"], "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3088014.png", "usersrated": "0", "rpgproducer": ["Kelly Pawlik"], "statistics": [], "rpg": ["5e Game System Product (D&D 5th Edition Compatible)"], "rpgpublisher": ["dire rugrat publishing"], "average": "0", "rpgcategory": ["Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"], "rpgseries": ["Advantageous Abilities"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3088014_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>Charisma: compelling attractiveness or charm that can inspire devotion in others.<br/><br/>Advantageous Abilities:  Charismatic Abilities includes over fifteen abilities for GMs to give their NPCs an advantageous edge (and a little role-playing fun).<br/><br/>Catch your PCs off guard with abilities like Unexpected Attack, throw in a complication with Golden Reputation, or give your NPCs the edge with Hang in There.
