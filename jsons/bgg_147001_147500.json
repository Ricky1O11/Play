Also featured is the primal couatl (CR 13), which is more in tune with the forces of nature than the heavens, and possesses a powerful hypnotic gaze and hallucinogenic venom. Finally, the radiant couatl (CR15) is a paragon of the typical couatl&rsquo;s ideals, but in addition to being advanced and having better spellcasting, its radiant wings can disable those who gaze upon it, and its blood is a fabled cure-all, giving characters of any stripe a reason to come to blows with one.<br/><br/>"}, "147486": {"rpgitemversion": {"218685": "PDF version"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Burglar", "rpgproducer": {"34854": "James Spahn"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1767436.png", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"1652": "Labyrinth Lord"}, "rpgcategory": {"2108": "Sourcebook (rules/options to enhance play)"}, "rpggenre": {"155": "Fantasy (High Fantasy)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1767436_t.png", "description": "From publisher blurb:<br/><br/>If I say he is a Burglar, a Burglar he is!<br/><br/>Halflings can be more than just simple folk who enjoy the creature comforts of life!

It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!<br/><br/>Multiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios.<br/><br/><br/>Factions<br/><br/>Each of the cards in the 80 card Trade Deck is a Ship or a Base belonging to one of four factions: The Trade Federation, The Blobs, The Star Empire or The Machine Cult.<br/><br/><br/>Trade Federation<br/><br/>In the far future, the more traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership. The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation&rsquo;s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation&rsquo;s trade and other interests.<br/><br/><br/>The Blobs<br/><br/>These mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, &ldquo;The Blobs&rdquo;. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.<br/><br/><br/>Star Empire<br/><br/>The Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.<br/><br/><br/>Machine Cult<br/><br/>A cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion. The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.<br/><br/><br/>Playing Star Realms<br/><br/>\u200bWhen you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.<br/><br/>As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&rsquo;s Authority directly.<br/><br/>Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but it&rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"316212": "Brazilian first edition"}, "boardgameintegration": {"182631": "Star Realms: Colony Wars"}, "average": "7.64437", "name": "Star Realms", "playingtime": "20", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "12", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "19835", "boardgameaccessory": {"167751": "Star Realms: Battlecruiser Alternate Art Promo Card"}, "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "147021": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1757586.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"173609": {"name": "Hollywood: Season of Festivals"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"68986": {"name": "Nikolay Pegasov"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2013", "maxplayers": "6", "boardgameartist": {"69037": "Sergey Dulin"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"7496": {"name": "Egmont Polska"}}, "maxplaytime": "30", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1757586_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "description": "In the movie-making game Hollywood, each player is a studio boss who tries to produce the most successful blockbuster.

From the insidious quasit to the lordly balor, the reeking hezrou to the stealthy soul-devouring shadow demon, this product covers CRs from 2 to 25. There are demons that will tear your body apart and demons that will seduce and subvert all that is good and true, including mythic versions of the incubus and succubus. On top of a dozen demons you already know, Mythic Monsters: Demons introduces a brand-new addition to the Abyssal arsenal, the titanic two-headed gulgerak, a demonic war machine that will have your PCs running for their lives. As if 13 demons were not enough, Mythic Monsters: Demons also contains rules for playing mythic demons with extra flair, including breaching planar walls, demonic bargains, and demonic possession!<br/><br/>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself.

It is designed in the style of a CCG, although players can play with all cards online via a plugin for LackeyCCG. Along with building their decks, players choose a Herd Leader card representing one of the show's main characters. Herd Leaders determine a player's hand size, Herd Morale, and special abilities.<br/><br/>Players lose when their Herd Morale is lowered to 0, or they can no longer draw a card. This is primarily done by playing Pony cards; each player may have up to three Ponies on the field at a time. Players may also play Spell cards, with various effects. Any card may be played face-down as a resource. Spells played as a resource may be flipped face-up and played for free, if the player has enough total resources.<br/><br/>Each turn a player may have his ponies clash with any of his opponents. If the opposing pony's power is lower or equal, it is Staggered, and the defending player takes Piercing Damage equal to the difference in power and Stagger Damage equal to the losing pony's cost. At the start of each player's turn, he may revive one of his Staggered ponies.

Parents, teachers, and students will recognize the great advantage of learning while playing.<br/> In this game, you make duplicate copies of the battleship target illustrations and the numbered &quot;Special Factors&quot; cards. Then follow the simple attack procedures against each battleship.  Damage scores will vary depending where bomb  hits occur plus a random number variation.  Hence, player can expect a different outcome each time they play the game. The game can be plyed solo to in small groups.<br/><br/>This game is part of a larger Pearl Harbor Re-enactment Guide.  This part of the game based upon the high level bomber attack on Battleship Row, Pearl Harbor.  Forty-eight high Level bombers, in ten arrow formations, carrying and dropped the secret &quot;Dragon Tooth&quot; 800kg armor piercing bomb against the inboard battleship on Battleship Row, Pearl Harbor.  Fouled by smoke and sun glare, they managed to make a dismal six hits on American battleships.  Although, only six big bombs hit American battleships, one No.80 bomb struck and penetrated the USS Arizona's forward powder magazine causing a violent explosion.  The game can be adapted easily for solo or team play.   Can you do better?<br/><br/>Play Commander Mitsuo Fuchida's attack on American battleships in Pearl Harbor.

They can turn off security cameras, move guards, turn off the lights, unlock doors or turn off alarms. If everything goes smoothly, your team will work like clockwork to steal the one item you're all here for.  If all goes smoothly.<br/><br/>Not only do the players have to work precisely, but they have to work quickly before the next guard shift comes in.

The sneaky wolf has entered the farmhouse! He might already have disguised himself as a sheep, a hunter or a hunting dog.

Meanwhile, the shepherd boy has repeatedly fooled others by crying out &quot;Wooolf! Wooolf!!&quot;. So the hunter and the hunting dog have to be careful with the shepherd boy. Everyone has to find out the real identity of others. Will the wolf finally catch the real sheep, or can the sheep find the hunter and the hunting dog who can protect them?<br/><br/>Wooolf!! Is a fast playing deduction game suitable for four to eight players. Each player has two character cards, one of which represents his true identity and the other is only there to cause confusion. Character cards include wolf, sheep, shepherd boy, hunter, and hunting dog.

You can bring enemies around to your point of view with a sword as Geralt - or bribe them with gold and threaten to call on powerful friends as Dandelion.

Oh, no. On the contrary, they are trying to get as far away from it as possible because this monkey is not a mischievous nuisance but rather a reanimated zombie monstrosity of an ape. Once the players have stumbled over all the monkey parts and the monkey awakes, it will climb after the players, eating the brains of the ones it catches until only one player remains &ndash; the winner.<br/><br/>In game terms, each player starts with a hand of five cards. On a turn, a player draws 1-2 cards, then plays at most one Junk card to start or continue building his tower and at most one Reinforcement card to strengthen his highest Junk card. He can also play one or more Attack cards on opponents to try to demolish their towers, lowering them within reach of Frankenmonkey. Players can use Defense cards to try to ward off attacks, with the active player rolling a die to see whether an attack succeeds. If it does, that player's tower might further crumble as the junk collapses on top of other junk.<br/><br/>Each time a player uses a card with a monkey claw on it, a new part is added to Frankenmonkey on the assembly board; if the monkey is complete, then the claw raises the monkey up one level on the height board. At the end of each player's turn, the monkey (if still complete) rises one level, eliminating players at that same height.<br/><br/>Players can use Primate Fear cards with Spank the Monkey rules and vice versa, or they can combine the games, with the goal being to spank the monkey before anyone else while still having your brain intact.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/><br/>    Spank the Monkey<br/><br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"217914": "English first edition"}, "average": "6.05909", "name": "Primate Fear", "playingtime": "45", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "age": "0", "usersrated": "88", "boardgamefamily": {"7178": "Animals: Apes / Monkeys"}}, "147146": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Black Belt (1984)", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"217915": "North American Apple II edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1763712.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2493": "Martial Arts"}, "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2342": "Beat 'em Up"}, "videogameplatform": {"4978": "Apple II"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1763712_t.jpg", "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Work your way up to Black Belt in a series of Tae Kwon Do sparring matches.

On a turn, a player reveals the top card from his deck and (in most cases) says either &quot;Color!&quot; or &quot;Word!&quot;, asking for opponents to yell out either the color of the text or the word printed on the card. If the first opponent to answer yells out correctly, she keeps this card (and any cards already on the table) and places it in her score pile; if the first player is wrong, the current card stays in the center of the table and the wrong player places one previously scored card in the center, too.<br/><br/>Some cards have special functions, such as allowing the player who wins the card to peek at the top card of an opponent's deck. Other cards are multipliers and they double the points scored for cards claimed previously; to track this, you must keep cards in order as you claim them. Still other cards are &quot;Mystery&quot; cards, and the player who reveals a Mystery card should immediately ask any question at all, the more bizarre the better.

These obstacles can be overcome with the right cards: Tent Cards for sand storms, Weapons Cards for robbers, Compass Cards for fog, and Secret Code Cards for spies.  These Equipment Cards can be obtained at different cities on the trails in the North-- if one can answer a trivia question.  The player can choose from two types of questions: History &amp; Geography, or Biblical Scriptures.  Young children can play without having to answer the questions.<br/><br/>So as well as a Race Game, Stella Nova is a Strategy Game where players must decide which is the most efficient path to take, and what resources and equipment to keep and what to leave behind.<br/><br/>Of course the magi must also obtain the three precious gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to give to the Christ child.  These Gift Cards are only available a specific cities in the South.<br/><br/>Magi can capture a wild stallion at the oases and get a Wild Stallion Card.  These cards can provide an advantage, such as racing ahead or jumping over other magi, or can give a disadvantage to an opponent, such as going back three spaces.<br/><br/>Stella Nova is a great Party Trivia game too.  Players demonstrate their knowledge by answering questions on Biblical history and geography to obtain the needed Equipment and Gifts Cards.<br/><br/>Note: Stella Nova is an Educational Game for students, because it's historically and geographically accurate.  The cities have their ancient names from the time of Christ.  For example, Yathrib in Arabia is called Medina today.  It was renamed by the Muslim prophet Mohamed in about 622 AD.<br/><br/>"}, "147165": {"poll": {}, "name": "Sea World Treasure Key Board Game", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2007": "Pick-up and Deliver"}, "yearpublished": "1983", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1759992_t.jpg", "average": "4.5", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"117": {"name": "International Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1759992.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"217944": "First Edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "3", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "A Seaworthy Adventure for Little Treasure Hunters!<br/><br/>Each player in turn spins the spinner and moves that number of spaces on the game path to either &quot;Treasure Cove&quot; or a &quot;Sea Place.&quot;  Each player tries to collect 3 keys; one each from 3 Sea Places.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).<br/><br/>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.<br/><br/>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region.

The player left to the dealer starts play placing one card on the Castle; the others will follow in clockwise order. The color (red or black) of the first card played by the opener assigns the color of each team for that game: e.g., if the opener chooses to play a 3 of Hearts, he and his partner will be the Reds, and the other team the Blacks. Goal of the Reds is to score points by capturing black cards, and vice versa for the Blacks. Cards are to be placed on the Castle, on top of those already on the desk, forming piles controlled by the card on top of it. Each card has an intrinsic value that follows the natural order, starting from the Ace (1) up to the King (13). In the Castle, each card can have from 2 up to 4 neighbors, i.e. cards adjacent either horizontally or vertically. The total value of a card on the Castle is equal to its intrinsic value increased by 1 for each neighbor of the same color and decreased by 1 for each of the opposite: e.g. a red 10 having 3 red and 1 black neighbors, will have a total value equal to the intrinsic value of a Queen.<br/><br/>Rules of the game:<br/>1 - it's alway allowed to place on top of a card another card of the same color<br/>2- a card of the opposite color can be placed, changing the control of the pile, if the card to be placed has an intrinsic value higher than the total value of the card on top of that pile<br/>3- a player can pass the turn.

When using a regular deck, the cards represent the following: <br/>&bull;    Ace: a Safe House<br/>&bull;    King: Grandpa &ndash; the only character willing to sacrifice himself for his family<br/>&bull;    Queen: Grandma<br/>&bull;    Jack: Dad<br/>&bull;    10: Mom<br/>&bull;    2 thru 9: the children and their friends<br/>&bull;    Joker: You, the armed and dangerous hero<br/>&bull;    Card from the second deck (logo side only): zombie<br/>&bull;    D6 die: ammo box (6 rounds inside)<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Zombie Solitaire is set up like regular &ldquo;Klondike&rdquo; solitaire with 7 stacks, four collection zones for aces, and a draw pile &ndash; all from a single deck of cards.  In addition, 10 cards from a second deck are set, faced down, in a pile to the right of the 7 stacks. The joker is placed below the zombie pile, with the [4] dice off to the side.<br/>&bull;    Draw pile: crowd of survivors from the zombie apocalypse<br/>&bull;    7 stacks: temporary shelters to which some of the survivors have fled and others may follow.

That&rsquo;s when the zombies finally arrive &ndash; and all bets are off!<br/><br/>In Zombie Solitaire, only one survivor card &ndash; the top card of the deck &ndash; is drawn each time.<br/>Play the game as normal, but with the following adjustments:<br/>&bull;    You do not have to play a survivor card that you have drawn from the draw pile even if you have an available play. It is always your choice whether or not to play a card.<br/>&bull;    You cannot play a survivor card on top of a zombie card.<br/>&bull;    You cannot move any card (or stack) that is under attack from a zombie and you cannot move any card (or stack) onto a stack that is under attack from a zombie &ndash; until the zombie is destroyed<br/>&bull;    You do not come under attack for drawing an ace from the survivor draw pile (or from one of the stacks) and setting it up as a safe house and you do not come under attack for moving a survivor to a safe house. <br/>&bull;    You can move a king (and its stack) to an empty space on the board without coming under attack as long as there is no zombie on the king's stack. But if you move a king from the draw pile to the board, it will come under attack .<br/><br/>Zombie threat:<br/>Individual zombies are not a threat to the survivors. They are endangered only when two zombies attack at the same time. When a second zombie card is added to a temporary shelter stack, the bottom survivor card is removed from the game (where it will contribute no victory points to the player&rsquo;s total).  The attack will also destroy one of the zombies, whose card is returned to the zombie horde.<br/><br/>Victory:      <br/>The game is over when you no longer have any available moves, no kings to sacrifice and no ammunition.  Count up the number of Safe Houses you established and the number of survivors who made it to a Safe House.

The idea for this and future volumes is that they will take multiple existing games from the VPG Napeoleonic 20 series, add an as-yet-unpublished game to the mix, and create a GMT boxed game with 3-4 games in the box, using larger (3/4&quot;) counters and mounted maps.<br/><br/>The Napoleonic 20 series from Victory Point Games are lower complexity wargames which use a common system originally created by veteran designer Joe Miranda, and further refined by developers Alan Emrich and Lance McMillan. The system&rsquo;s name is derived from the fact that there are generally just 20 or fewer pieces in play on the map at one time (that's 20 pieces total, for both sides). The system is easy to learn and fast-playing, creating a tense, dramatic and challenging situation on the game board where higher echelon troop formations (generally corps) vie for position and dominance. The series features twelve pages of Standard rules, four pages of Optional rules, and one-to-two pages of Exclusive rules for each title.<br/><br/>A hallmark feature of the Napoleonic 20 series is the use of narrative random event cards to help &ldquo;tell the story&rdquo; unique to each battle or small campaign. This &ldquo;friction of war&rdquo; element, combined with the operational-level maneuver, intense combat, and even periods of inactivity as armies pause to rest and reorganize, provides a thrilling battle full of unexpected twists and reversals of fortune. Morale plays a vital role as both sides can &lsquo;spend&rsquo; this precious resource to force march their units, help rally stragglers, or commit reserves to key combats. But look out&hellip; when a side&rsquo;s morale is reduced to zero, it has lost the game! The games also features simple optional rules for limited intelligence/Fog-of-War, the important shaping effects of leadership, and the gradual erosion of troop effectiveness due to fatigue.<br/><br/>The Rising Glory multi-pack features one game each from Alan Emrich and Lance McMillan, and two designs by Kim Meints.<br/><br/>Austerlitz 20(the &ldquo;Battle of the Three Emperors;&rdquo; Napoleon vs. Kutuzov, 1805)<br/>Jena 20, 2nd edition (Napoleon vs. the Brunswick &amp; Hohenloe, 1806)<br/> Eylau 20 (Napoleon vs. Bennigsen, 1807)<br/>Wagram 20 (Napoleon vs. Archduke Charles, 1809)<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>Four 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; mounted  maps ( 2 boards, backprinted)<br/>Approximately 150  3/4&quot;  Counters (thick, with Rounded corners, like No Retreat)<br/>48 Event cards (12 for each game)<br/>One 16-page Standard Rules booklet<br/>One 16-page Exclusive Rules playbook<br/>Two Player Aid charts<br/><br/>Individual Games designed by Alan Emrich, Lance McMillan, and Kim Meints<br/><br/>On February 9, 2015, GMT Games deleted this game from their P500 list and gave it back to Victory Point Games.<br/><br/>"}, "147201": {"rpgitemversion": {"224892": "ePub Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Fate Worlds, Volume Two: Worlds in Shadow", "rpghonor": {"24507": "2013 Golden Geek Best RPG Supplement Nominee"}, "rpgproducer": {"34526": "Christopher Hanrahan"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1762138.jpg", "usersrated": "30", "average": "7.44333", "rpgissuearticle": {"151554": "Just Announced!"}, "rpggenre": {"169": "Action / Adventure (Pulp)"}, "rpg": {"203": "Fate Core"}, "rpgcategory": {"2107": "Campaign Setting (game world)"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1762138_t.jpg", "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Flexible RPG systems like Fate Core are terrific if you have the time and energy to put into building a world.

But every attempt to wrest copper from the ground hangs the fortunes of your company, and the lives of your miners, in the balance.<br/><br/>In Copper Country, each player takes on the role of a unique mining company and competes to produce the most copper before it's all gone!

Expand your mining empire by building shaft houses and hoist houses to increase your copper production.<br/><br/>When a player produces copper, the byproduct &mdash; poor rock &mdash; is removed from the industry track and dumped onto the mine site, reducing shifts nearby for all players. As players remove more poor rock from the industry track, local businesses open their doors, historical events occur, and Copper Country enters new eras of production.

Fishermen and sailors used to pay homage to Taimat in turn for fair seas and little trouble. However, the sailors have grown comfortable and neglected to respect Tiamat. In an effort to regain the control she once had, Tiamat has entrapped random sailors in her ever-changing seas of chaos. Forcing these sailors to turn to a life of piracy, they will have to navigate ever changing seas, explore ocean, plunder treasure and fight each other to survive! Only the most successful and rich sailor turned pirate will be set free from her chaotic world.<br/><br/>Players each start with a simple vessel and gradually gain stats to build their vessel in different categories to develop their own strategy to win. Players can upgrade their speed, hull size, defense, and attack. The more treasure you collect, you advance your Pirate Rating. The first player to a Pirate Rating of five, triggers game end. The winner is the player with the highest value of treasure.<br/><br/>The game board is modular. The modular hexagonal tiles consist of different islands and treasure that need to be discovered to come into play. There are islands that contain treasure, repair docks, Merchant ports where you can buy Merchant cards to help you on your travels, or empty islands that complicate your sailing. There are also open ocean tiles and whirlpools. Whirlpools also give you cards, of which most have negative effects on your ship or others. The games starts with everyone on the main island. Once a player starts sailing, they discover the modular game tiles as them move. The tiles are pulled at random from a shuffled deck to keep the gameboard different for every game.<br/><br/>While a player navigates the treacherous waters, they are on the lookout for treasure. Once a player finds their treasure, they will plunder it from an island, and bring it back to the starting Island in which they will bury the treasure for safe keeping.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"218074": "First Edition"}, "age": "12", "name": "Seas of Chaos", "playingtime": "90", "boardgamemechanic": {"2011": "Modular Board"}, "average": "6.29667", "usersrated": "3", "boardgamefamily": {"22185": "Admin: Cancelled Games"}}, "147219": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Alarums & Excursions (Issue 116 - Apr 1985)", "rpgproducer": {"13226": "Lee Gold"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1760603.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "average": "9", "rpgissue": {"1494": "Alarums & Excursions"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"144713": "Agents of Fortune"}, "rpg": {"191": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"218077": "First Printing"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1760603_t.jpg", "description": "Alarums &amp; Excursions<br/>Issue #116<br/>April 1985<br/><br/>Cover art by Kate Gehrke.<br/><br/>"}, "147220": {"boardgamedesigner": {"70300": {"name": "Richard Linn"}}, "average": "0", "poll": {}, "name": "Equals: The Number Strategy Game", "playingtime": "20", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgameartist": {"70300": "Richard Linn"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"25774": {"name": "Linn Publishing"}}, "boardgameversion": {"218078": "English edition 2013"}, "maxplaytime": "20", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "7", "minplaytime": "20", "description": "Players use number combinations and strategy to get rid of all their cards to win the game.

That respect faded over time as people found for new idols among the rich and famous. Kirk became a nobody and nearly abandoned his passion. Wealth and fame are useless against zombies, however, and Kirk surprised himself upon discovering he hadn't lost his skills.

He was about to let the whole damn world burn when his conscience tickled his mind. He had to go back to the city, find his former friends, and save their butts. The situation is even worse than he expected, but so far, wilderness lessons apply very well to urban survival.<br/><br/>Rose was your ideal loving, caring, cooking, loveable aunt, always smiling and giving out wise words to the whole family. Some people, however, started to worry for her after one or two memory lapses. They were wrong to underestimate Aunt Rose. When the zombies came, she was horrified at first but adapted to the situation faster than many younglings. Sure, there is blood and mayhem, and sure, she sometimes forgets her reading glasses in the fridge, but Rose has found a brand new family of survivors to care for.<br/><br/>Thaissa was a successful entrepreneur when the zombies came and tried to change the deal. She kept her cool and slightly altered her terms of service to fit the situation. Thaissa now grows her network among local survivors, dealing in equipment, information, and weapons. Of course, her beauty and unusual attire help a lot.

The object of the game is to destroy Perfect1, who is ranked number 1. After eliminating a rithm, the player may then absorb its energy by walking through the cloud of static it leaves behind. Doing so gives a boost to one of three statistics: maximum defense (hit points), maximum offense (ammunition) or maximum agility (fuel). The tougher the opponent defeated, the larger the boost that the player receives. The weakest are the &quot;Goners&quot;, who are all ranked number 256, and therefore yield no increase in rank when destroyed, even at the beginning of the game. Picassos, Torks, Kilroys, Venuses, and Davids are more powerful than Goners, and each individual among them has a unique rank.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Movement is akin to that of a combat flight simulator, though restricted to the ground. Pressing up on the D-pad causes the player character to accelerate, which consumes agility. Once in motion, the player rithm will continue moving forward at the same speed until it accelerates further, runs into an obstacle, or comes to an immediate stop (accomplished by pressing both shoulder buttons simultaneously). Though running into an obstacle prevents the character from advancing, its legs continue to run, and if turned away from the obstacle the character will resume moving at the same speed as before. If the player character runs out of agility, movement is reduced to a slow limping. Agility can be replenished by standing still or visiting the DOAsys, a small neutral zone where the player character can converse with other rithms, including boss characters. Offense and defense can be replenished at the recovery spires found throughout Perfect, or at the DOAsys. Other rithms also use recovery spires, and their resources are finite. However, they are regularly recharged during &quot;storms&quot;. Standing on a recovery spire during a storm drains the player rithm's defense.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When a player&rsquo;s rithm is destroyed, it receives a decrease to its stats, and the player character is sent back to the &ldquo;real world.&rdquo; The player character may also voluntarily jack out from Perfect at any of the recovery spires, or at the DOAsys. While in the real world, the player may review the net gains (or losses) to the player character's stats since the last jacking out, view statistics on their performance, save the game, or load a saved game. A game over is only reached if the character's Defense stat reaches 0, or if the character loses the final boss fight.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In order to confront Perfect1, the player must first defeat the other ten bosses. Unlike other enemies, bosses generally do not wander through Perfect, and can be confronted at their specific lair at any time the player chooses. However, boss lairs disappear during storms, leaving the bosses to wander freely until the storm ends.&quot;<br/><br/>Released in Japan under the name Perfect World.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Immercenary&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "147251": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2437641.jpg", "is_expanded_by": {"179491": {"name": "Lembitu: Heavy Cavalry"}}, "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"40785": {"name": "Aigar Alaveer"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2015", "maxplayers": "4", "boardgamepublisher": {"14529": {"name": "2D6.EE"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2437641_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "45", "boardgamecategory": {"1046": {"name": "Fighting"}}, "description": "It's the dawn of the Livonian Crusade, and Estonia is being conquered by several nations.

Longitudinal lines are also drawn connecting the points. The central circle is green and is called the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair.  At four equidistant locations on the outer circle, an additional three points (connected by lines to each other and to three points on the board&rsquo;s outer edge) form Knight&rsquo;s Castles, one each named for St. George, St. Patrick, St. Andrew, and St. David. The Dragon&rsquo;s lone piece begins the game on the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair; the Knights&rsquo; three pieces each begin on the points of the Knight&rsquo;s Castle.<br/><br/>Beginning with the Knights and ending with the Dragon, players take turns rolling a die and moving according to the results. The player will move any one of their pieces the exact number of points rolled on the die, in any combination of directions, so long as the lines between points are followed and points are not crossed or landed on a second time.  Pieces cannot move to or jump over occupied points, except when the Dragon captures a Knight. Dragons move in the same fashion as Knights, but when their move ends on an occupied point, that Knight is removed from play. The Dragon may win the game by taking two of each Knight&rsquo;s pieces. Knights may not capture or slay the Dragon, but may win by reaching the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair central point with two of their pieces. The first Knight to do so wins the game.  A Knight may not pass over the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair as part of a move; they must land there only on the end of their move. Having landed on the board&rsquo;s central point, the Knight is then removed from play and set behind his Castle to keep score.<br/><br/>The game can be played by two, three, four, or five players.  For five players, one each plays a Knight and one the Dragon. For four players the game is the same but St. Patrick&rsquo;s Knights are not used.  For three players, one player takes the Knights of St. Andrew and St. George, one player takes St. David and St. Patrick, and one the Dragon.

The balance of forces varies, and it takes only a little to break the fragile balance. Fellowships are made, then breached in moments, but the stakes are much bigger than the power over Rawen. The New Ones fight not just for victory; they are seeking themselves. A secret part of their essence, which they can hardly remember. They were born on another world, which they gave up in exchange for survival. In the depths of their minds, a name pulsates about which neither their new dependents nor The Old Ones might know: Earth. The War of the Gods started in the far past of Rawen, but it affects the future of the whole universe.<br/><br/>In the Rawen Trading Card Game, the Gods of Rawen wield their power through their Warlords. As they expand their territories, the armies of the opposing Gods frequently battle one another. Your goal is to defeat the enemy warlord with the help of fighting units, heroes, and summoned spells. Successful attacks by your army weaken your enemies, and thus weaken their God, too. If the enemy warlord ever has as many wounds as health points, the warlord dies and you win the battle.<br/><br/>In game terms, each player chooses a warlord and a class, then creates a deck of at least 45 cards, with the warlord card, class card and primeval energy cards not counting toward this total. The game is turn-based, and in the main phase of your turn, you may act in any order, placing cards from your hand onto the battlefield, attacking with your units, activating a special power, and so on.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"218317": "English first edition"}, "name": "Rawen TCG", "playingtime": "15", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "average": "7.71429", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "7", "boardgamefamily": {"6040": "CCGs (Collectible Card Games)"}}, "147346": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Bug Too!", "videogamemode": {"2422": "Local Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"218318": "North American Saturn edition"}, "average": "0", "videogametheme": {"2350": "Movie, Book, TV show"}, "usersrated": "0", "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "videogameplatform": {"4439": "SEGA Saturn"}, "poll": {}, "description": "Bug Too! is the sequel to Bug!, a Sega Saturn game that was also ported to Windows.

The rules for that game including how the board works can be found at the following link on Chess Variants:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href='http://www.chessvariants.org/3d.dir/startrek.html' rel='nofollow'>http://www.chessvariants.org/3d.dir/startrek.html</a><br/><br/>Play begins with black pieces on all dark squares of the lowest fixed board and similarly on the two movable boards which start adjacent to it. To move a movable board, it must be empty at the time but with that proviso one can on a turn either move a movable exactly as in 3-D chess (explained below for clarity) or move a piece. The rules are exactly as in standard draughts (checkers) otherwise.<br/><br/>A big difference is that the movable board which start with white pieces begin BELOW, not above, the upper fixed board and movable boards start away from the player.<br/><br/>How the board works:<br/>3 checkered 4x4 boards with a white square on the near right corner for either player are in fixed positions at levels 2, 4 and 6. The lateral edges are aligned but the three fixed boards are staggered so that the nearer two rows of the middle fixed board (at level 4) exactly overlap the farther two rows of the fixed board nearer to either player. The fixed board on which the black player has pieces starting is at level 2 and thus lower than the middle board. Similarly the fixed board on which white pieces start are at level 6 and thus above the middle fixed board.<br/><br/>4 movable checkered 2x2 boards with a white space in the nearer right corner are also included. Two of these boards start at level 3 with one corner each overlapping either of the two corners of the fixed board at level 2 farther away from the black player so that the other 3 spaces of the movable boards are not over that same fixed board; these two movable boards start filled with black pieces. Similarly 2 movable board start at level 5 filled with white pieces, and these board start with one corner overlapping either of the two corners of the fixed board at level 6 farther away from the white player. The other three squares are not under that same fixed board.<br/><br/>Levels 1 and 7 start empty. A variant of the game makes all the board fixed in their initial positions. When movement of movable board is allowed, an empty movable board can be moved up or down 2 levels (but not above level 7 or below level 1) in which case it switches between above or below the same corner of a given fixed board. Without changing level, the movable board can be moved to a position above or below the other corner along the same edge of a fixed board as it already occupies. So a movable board at level 7 above the back right corner of the fixed board at level 6 can if empty be moved to above the back left or front right corner of the board at level 6, assuming of course no other movable board is already there.<br/><br/>Spaces directly above or below each other will have the same color.<br/><br/>Pieces' moves general conventional draughts moves to 3-D as follows. One looks at the board from above and flattens it. If the piece could move onto a space in this flattened version of the board, it can move onto it so long as a piece does not skip a level. Namely, in a non-capturing move, one cannot move directly from level 4 to level 6 and one can only do so in a capturing move if jumping a piece on a board at level 5.<br/><br/>What playing is like:<br/>It sounds harder than it is but does take some getting used to.

This is done by denying areas of the country to them and eliminating British units. After this is completed, the Irish forces split along the line of the civil war. As the Free State (pro-treaty) player you will likely be initially outnumbered by the Republicans (anti-treaty), but with superior organisation and tactics, you can force their surrender.<br/><br/>Historical background and the game: There are very few games on either the Irish war of independence, or the subsequent civil war. The war of independence can be indirectly blamed on the Germans. In 1912, after years (centuries, some would say) of resistance, the British parliament passed the Irish Home Rule bill. The bill then began to grind its way through parliament to become law. This was widely approved in Ireland, apart from the North-east, where the largely Protestant population feared for their future in what would be a largely Catholic state. They started to arm themselves as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), and so did their Irish nationalist adversaries. Civil war looked likely, but was happily averted by the sudden arrival of several million heavily armed Germans in Belgium and France. Both the UVF and the Nationalists then happily joined the British army to fight the common foe. Meanwhile, the home rule bill was suspended for the war's duration, but sure it would all be over by Christmas... wouldn't it?<br/><br/>It wasn't, and by 1916 some more radical Nationalists (called Republicans) got fed up and in Easter staged a farcical uprising, limited to those units that didn't get the message that it had been called off. It was crushed, but the hanging of the leaders, and the increasing harshness of British measures as the war progressed caused a sea-change in public opinion. In the 1918 general election, almost all of Ireland (not the North-east) voted in the Sinn Fein party, which refused to sit in the British parliament and, in 1919 declared Irish independence. Desultory fighting started between the new Irish Republican Army (IRA) and British forces. This is the point at which the game starts, with IRA units of varying capability in most areas of Ireland, and British garrisons (mostly Royal Irish Constabulary) throughout. In 1920 the home rule bill (remember it) passed, but by now with a special amendment allowing two parliaments - one for the North-east (now called Northern Ireland) and one for the rest of Ireland. Sinn Fein ignored it, as they already considered themselves independent, while Northern Ireland voted itself into existence. The game shows this effect with Northern Ireland having extra military units of the UVF.<br/><br/>As the war progressed, the IRA were most successful in the Southern parts of Ireland, and the British forces were gradually excluded from the countryside and limited to towns. The game simulates this by giving different units different strength depending on the terrain - IRA guerillas and Flying columns are best in the countryside, the British better in the urban areas.<br/><br/>With neither side able to win, and the British half expecting the home rule bill to have solved things in the first place, a peace treaty was signed. The treaty gave Southern Ireland (now called the Free State) Dominion status (like in Australia or Canada), with the King still as head of state, and cemented the separation of Northern Ireland. Naturally, this disgusted the more radical elements of Sinn Fein (led by Eamon De Valera), and military units who considered that they had won and so should have full independence. An election in 1922 was won handily by the pro-treaty Sinn Fein, but this did not solve things and fighting started as the pro-treaty forces, under Michael Collins, started to assert themselves over the anti-treaty forces. At this point, the players forces are split - largely along historical lines, with the South containing more anti-treaty forces, and the East more pro-treaty forces. As the player, you control the Free State forces against the anti-treaty republicans. This also means that you need to be careful how you fight the British since you will be raising troops that may not be loyal to the Free State!<br/><br/>Initially outnumbered, the Free State forces rapidly mobilised and quite quickly crushed the Republicans. They used innovative tactics, notably landing troops by ship at key points behind enemy lines, and were able to win battles because they generally had artillery and armour (armoured cars) while the republicans didn't. In the game you can perform naval landings, and you have attached artillery and armoured car units to give a bonus in combat.<br/><br/>Victory is decided by two things - How quickly the British are beaten, and how quickly/completely the Republicans are beaten.<br/><br/>"}, "147373": {"rpg": {"21687": "Firefly Role-Playing Game"}, "poll": {}, "name": "Serenity Crew", "rpgproducer": {"51863": "Mark Diaz Truman"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1765365.jpg", "usersrated": "1", "rpgitemversion": {"218366": "PDF version"}, "rpgsetting": {"287": "The 'Verse"}, "average": "10", "statistics": {}, "rpggenre": {"940": "Action / Adventure"}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpgseries": {"23300": "Echoes of War"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1765365_t.jpg", "description": "Publisher blurb:<br/><br/>The War between the Alliance and the Independents is a sore subject for a lot of folks, some more than others.

Shrouded in mist and mystery! A game of twists and barbed wire turns.<br/><br/>THE GUV'NOR! You play rival prison gangs; the Landing Mob, the Kitchen Gang, the Gym Boyz, the Garden Crew, the Laundry Syndicate and the Library Club<br/><br/>Win the game by earning 20 parole points and be the first to get released!!<br/><br/>The game is designed by people who know what it's like, so the game has an authenticity beyond the traditional escape scenario!. In this game it's a bad move when a gang member escapes, because it weakens the gang left inside!<br/><br/>Players compete to gain territory across the prison map.  Winners place their cards in one of the vacant cells in the block.  The block makes a decision by a majority vote about who is to be The GUV&quot;NOR.  Unless one player has more than half the cells deals need to be done between players. Players then move along the track (called the perimeter wall) and where they land decides what actions take place.  Actions can change the number of cards in the block, place or remove trouble cards on the prison map, or require the block to make decisions.  Decisions will be determined by both the cards in the block at the time and the relationship  between the players.<br/><br/>This game enables all members of the family to play as it provides lots of times when &quot;I win you lose&quot; scenarios to arise.<br/><br/>Simple rules means they are easily mastered and that enables more sophisticated game play as players try to use the rules to get ahead.<br/><br/>Further rules including challenging the leadership of the GUV'NOR - making  regular decisions about who to back and what parole points to deal with  and lockdown - which gives the current GUV'NOR power to make the decisions the block did, including being ale to win a leadership challenge whatever the number of cards in the block raise tension as players try to find away to either stay in control or wrestle it away from others without the wrong rivals taking control.<br/><br/>If no one player dominates the Block then deals have to be done between players to form packs. But trust no one. Each turn players roll a dice and move around the board along the perimiter wall as they serve their sentence and have to make decisions about who they support. Decisions are determined by the number of gang member cards they have in The Block. Each turn can change the number of cards a player has and so alter their influence. Players have to manoeuvre themselves through their sentence until one player has gained 20 parole points. Points are lost or gained by getting caught by the staff, taking control of the Block, time served and from doing deals with other players to get their support.<br/><br/>This leads to a fast paced game, players are constantly changing sides, working out who best to support, and not getting caught by the staff. Watch as the  staff increase security, send you to solitary and threatens lockdown!   It is an exhausting game of wit, strategy, coercion and survival that brings out the best and the worst in participants! In the end you don't just win you probably get rehabilitated!<br/><br/>The rules are designed to be interdependent, hence the block makes decisions that effect the level of security.  At both extremes, ie too high or too low the scale has a trouble space.  If the scale is on trouble and all of the trouble cards are placed on the map then trouble starts.  this is a spontaneous battle for territory that lasts 4 turns and enables a potentially dramatic change in who runs the block.  This rule, like many others provides an exciting tension where players can predict what could happen next (within the dice roll) to change who is winning or what opportunities were lost to defeat who is currently in charge.<br/><br/>The game is very visual, so it matters where the players pieces are along the perimeter wall, how many cards are held in the block, what bonus cards are in solitary, whether the prison is in lockdown or not, and how many trouble cards there are on the map.<br/><br/>"}, "147396": {"boardgamedesigner": {"70349": {"name": "\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n Peterka"}}, "average": "5.67045", "poll": {}, "name": "Dr. Hrubec", "playingtime": "40", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "44", "maxplayers": "5", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1769895_t.png", "boardgameartist": {"61036": "Karel N.

Take brinkmanship to a nuclear level and control the World's most secret State!<br/><br/>The game is played in a fictional future North Korea. Play the leader of your own faction - THE ARMY, NAVY, AIRFORCE, BIG BUSINESS, THE PARTY AND THE FAMILY. Win by getting BRINKMANSHIP points, which reflect how good you are at manipulating your opponents and surviving as you raise the levels of international tension to nuclear levels. Win by getting to 20 points without blowing up the World<br/><br/>The Armed Forces, Big Business, The Party and the Family compete to fill the Central Committee with their supporters. The player who runs the Central Committee is The Leader!  There can only ever be one Leader, so it is importnat to understand the rules of the game and use them to your advantage! If no one player dominates the Committee then deals have to be done. Each turn players move around the board along the demilitarised zone which runs along the perimeter of the board and have to make decisions. Decisions are determined by the number of cards they have in The Central Committee. Each turn can change the number of cards a player has and so alter their influence. Players have to manoeuvre themselves through the politics until one player has gained 20 brinkmanship points. Points are gained by taking control of the Committee, time as Leader and from doing deals with other players to get their support.<br/><br/>At the same time the committee decides the level of international tension.  As public parades whip up popular fervour and brinkmanship is taken to a nuclear level so the opportunities for players to decide how to run the World's most secret State determine who ends up winning the game and who gets manipulated.<br/><br/>This leads to a fast paced game, players are constantly changing sides, working out who best to support, and not getting caught out in political exile. It is an exhausting game of wit, strategy, coercion and survival that brings out the best and the worst in participants! In the end you don't just win you have an great evening's entertainment!<br/><br/>Each space on the demilitarised zone offers the opportunity for the composition of central committee to change as players are beset with show trials, parades, rocket launches, 6 party peace talks and nuclear tests!<br/><br/>Past deals, double deals, double cross and you see where the strategy starts. Each player's strategy will be determined by their own strength of character, belief in their own destiny, how well they can manipulate others to support them and how they make best use of the opportunities as they arise.<br/><br/>As the game evolves so moments of growing tension occur as the population get ever more excited with increasing parades across the the Country, international tension nears extreme levels, infighting means there are no clear alliances and the date of the next central committee election approaches, only to be disrupted by a spontaneous war game! and rocket launch. Leadership crisis and mayhem. But then players only have themselves to blame as what happens is a result of the choices players make in the central committee. Ultimately players have the choice to create a peace agreement where the right strategies are promoted rather than a dash to the winning line! It is interesting to see how as a player nears the winning line that choice becomes more challenging!<br/><br/>As they say - Your best strategy is paranoia, take brinkmanship to a nuclear level and tale control of the Worlds most secret State!<br/><br/>"}, "147398": {"boardgamedesigner": {"11406": {"name": "Philippe Proux"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Tonooo", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2047": "Memory"}, "yearpublished": "2013", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "6", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1773625_t.jpg", "average": "5.8", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"8930": {"name": "Ludarden"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1773625.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"218415": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1009": {"name": "Abstract Strategy"}}, "age": "6", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Tonooo is an abstract game; the aim of the game is to be the first to have four small cylinders of different colours in front of you.  <br/>Each player in his turn : <br/> -Either draws a small cylinder from the bag and places it in one of the 4 big cylinders <br/> -Or he picks up one of the four big cylinders and takes all the small cylinders placed in it.<br/><br/>Each time there are at least 2 identical small cylinders, the players keeps one of them in front of him.<br/>      Each time there are not 2 identical small cylinders, the player is penalized  and replaces one of the small cylinders in front of him in the bag.<br/>      Each time there are no small cylinders left, the player is eliminated.<br/>There are also the uncoloured small cylinders (jokers)...<br/><br/>"}, "147399": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Zin Letters (Issue 1)", "rpgproducer": {"75687": "Markus Battarbee"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1773966.jpg", "usersrated": "0", "average": "0", "rpgissue": {"3873": "The Zin Letters"}, "rpgissuearticle": {"120523": "The Celestial Fires"}, "rpg": {"2664": "HeroQuest (1st Edition)"}, "rpgissueversion": {"218416": "Issue 1"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1773966_t.jpg", "description": "The first issue deals with Teshnan history, culture and religion, introduces a Ralian Orlanthi Clan, lays out the genealogy of the Storm Tribe, contains many useful scenario ideas for Orlanthi campaigns and finally introduces us to the Mineral Broos.<br/><br/>"}, "147400": {"boardgamedesigner": {"70900": {"name": "Petri Savola"}}, "average": "6.70145", "poll": {}, "name": "Kyoto Protocol", "playingtime": "30", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "2015", "usersrated": "69", "maxplayers": "7", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2014001_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"68116": "Katri Vainiom\u00e4ki"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"21967": {"name": "Roll D6 Games"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2014001.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"218418": "English/Finnish first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "30", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "8", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "In Kyoto Protocol, a card game about energy production and pollution, players play as power companies trying to fulfill a set amount of production quotas, while simultaneously avoiding the overuse of resources as this will result in pollution fines.<br/><br/>To produce energy, players draw resource cards from the table to their hand, and play sets of a resource type onto the table as production.

The players also distribute among themselves the five high offices of the Republic, and use the corresponding powers to their advantage as well as to hinder the other factions.<br/><br/>In the end, the faction that rebels to the Senate and wins the resulting civil war, or gains the allegiance of the majority of the Roman senators, wins the game, but only if the Republic is not bankrupt and the Roman people are content.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Roma Celer uses 54 poker-sized cards and 29 half-sized cards; the players must supply 60-80 euro-cubes or similar objects to be used as markers, and 16-18 six-sided dice.

Craftsmen and women from all over the kingdom are now hard at work, striving to be the first to craft five items from the list and win the honor of standing side-by-side with the royals as the gifts are presented to the five Dukes at The Queen's Jubilee.<br/><br/>King's Forge: Queen's Jubilee is an additional set of component's for the King's Forge board game.  It consists of a deck of 30 alternate craft cards that can be used in place of the deck of craft cards in the base game to enable a faster-playing game experience.

When chosen from the Gather line, all players get a clear die to use as a &quot;limited wild&quot;. It has to match the color of one of the dice you roll during crafting and you have to return the clear die at the end of the round. The person who selects CONJURER also gets a +2 bonus that the other players do not get.

What is so special about this game?<br/>Nothing really, beyond the fact that it combines several ideas I&rsquo;ve pulled from other games I&rsquo;ve enjoyed, hopefully in a way that both makes sense and is fun. This game is fairly light on rules, not too difficult to learn, but still capable of providing a complete and fun gaming experience.<br/><br/>Note the emphasis is on light. If you like spending hours optimizing every last detail of your character, picking exactly the right abilities and equipment to make them as capable as possible, planning how they are going to advance over the next twenty levels, if you like specific rules and modifiers that cover every possible condition and situation that could arise in play in minute detail, this is not the game for you. Not that there is anything wrong with games like that, but this isn&rsquo;t one of them. In this game, you can create a character in about 30 seconds, requiring very few decisions in the process, and almost every situation or task in the game is resolved in exactly the same way, with a single die roll.<br/><br/>Who is this game meant for? I&rsquo;ve tried to make it friendly to new gamers, not just by virtue of simple rules, but by explaining things in a manner that is hopefully easy to understand (yes, I did include the dreaded &ldquo;What is Role-playing&rdquo; section). I think people looking for a quick pick-up game might also like it, and I have tried to make it robust enough to support campaigns of at least moderate length.<br/><br/>In short, this is another rules-light generic fantasy RPG floating in a sea of similar products. I hope someone out there enjoys it and finds some use for it, but even if they don&rsquo;t, I have enjoyed writing it.<br/><br/>Oh, and what exactly is the titular Dragon Sword? I know what it is in my game, but there is no &ldquo;official&rdquo; definition, it&rsquo;s just a name I thought sounded neat and evocative. Make it whatever you want it to be, or nothing at all if you prefer.<br/><br/>Dislcaimer: Not playtested at all.<br/><br/>"}}
