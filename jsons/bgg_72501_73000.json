The player is allowed two items at a time: one weapon and one sub-item; picking up a different weapon or sub will switch out the current one. The character starts with a sword but can find a fire wand that deals ranged attacks at the sacrifice of attack power. Other items include a hammer for breaking down barriers and a potion for restoring all health. The player can also pick up another of the currently equipped weapon to gain a temporary boost to attack power, or an armor jacket to raise defense temporarily. These temporary boosts return to normal after a level is beaten. More permanent power-ups come in the form of strength gloves and heart containers, which upgrade attack and defense respectively.<br/><br/>The game can also be played with another player if the two individuals link their Game Boys together while the game is inserted.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Rolan's_Curse,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72502": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"41312": "Japanese DS release"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic737917.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5693": "Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side"}, "videogametheme": {"2472": "School"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5692": "Tokimeki Memorial"}, "average": "8", "videogamegenre": {"2333": "Dating Sim"}, "videogameplatform": {"4734": "Nintendo DS"}, "usersrated": "1", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic737917_t.jpg", "description": "User summary (with release information from Japanese Wikipedia):<br/><br/>A boy-dating high-school romance simulation game from Konami.

In order to be able to defeat the final boss (or find his weak spot), the player also had to follow a trail of clues which included searching for hidden doors and delivering objects to various characters in the game.<br/><br/>The game was ported to several home systems, and saw many renamings. The Mark III port was called Super Wonder Boy Monster World and so spawned a separate Westone game series: Monster World, in which this game was the first (while also being the second Wonder Boy game). As for Wonder Boy, Sega was the publisher and would not allow the title for other than Sega systems, but Westone owned the code and for the PC Engine port, the game was renamed &quot;Bikkuriman World&quot;, and is by far the most faithful of all ports. Tectoy, the Brazilian distributor of Monster World changed the character graphics to create the game M&ocirc;nica no Castelo do Drag&atilde;o (based on characters from a brazilian comic) for the Master System. Also, an unlicensed version of Monster World was also produced for the Famicon, under the title of Saiyuki World, changing the character's graphics.

Simplified deck building, hand management, simultaneous hidden worker placement, a card draft, 6 unique player advantages, and a revolutionary zero-luck combat resolution system ensure that playing Exile Sun is like no other game. Private and public card-based objectives give players options for points, but they must choose carefully when allocating their limited resources. The player with the most points accumulated at the end of three game cycles wins.<br/><br/>A Game Round<br/><br/>The game simply consists of cycles where each player in turn makes four fleet moves and then ends their turn by moving a pawn on the 'Timer Track'. The 'Timer Track' triggers events like 'Supply' and 'Battle' that effect all players simultaneously. Once each event is resolved, the player turns continue.<br/><br/><br/>            Moves - These moves can be regular movement, scanning an enemy fleet, launching a decoy fleet, and initiating a battle.  <br/>            Events - The battle and supply events are resolved with a mechanic that may be best described as simultaneous hidden worker placement. This unique mechanic involves the use of a control card with 10 sliding tabs. The resulting game play is tense, intuitive, and intensely competitive. <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>Theme Overview<br/><br/>Far off and forgotten, orbiting the Exile star, a fragmented group of Colonial powers is struggling to exist in the harsh environment of their foreign home.  Having been unexpectedly cut off from contact with Earth over two hundred years ago, the process of gaining some economic recovery has been slow and arduous.  With dissension rising among the populace, these leaders must compete to gain military, economic, and technological advantages over each other in a race to lead the united colonies in a mission to contact Earth. Time is short. While an outright planetary assault could express dominance in military power, perhaps luring out and destroying an opposing Flagship or Construction Shipyard can have the same effect using fewer resources. Or hit and run assaults with fleets of strike craft can be equally effective. But be warned, leaders dare not neglect their own colony resources, or their supporters will lose faith in them and they&rsquo;ll fall quickly out of the race.<br/><br/>", "minplayers": "2", "boardgameversion": {"139919": "English first edition"}, "average": "5.64248", "name": "Exile Sun", "playingtime": "180", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "age": "14", "boardgameexpansion": {}, "usersrated": "133", "boardgamesubdomain": {"5497": "Strategy Games"}, "boardgamefamily": {"8374": "Crowdfunding: Kickstarter"}}, "72538": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Balloon Kid", "videogamemode": {"2310": "Network Multiplayer"}, "videogameversion": {"41414": "English/European Game Boy edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1210152.png", "videogametheme": {"2466": "Other"}, "videogamegenre": {"2164": "Platform"}, "average": "6.64286", "videogamefranchise": {"5698": "Balloon Fight"}, "videogameplatform": {"4422": "Game Boy"}, "usersrated": "7", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1210152_t.png", "description": "[User Summary]<br/><br/>Balloon Kid is a platform game (more of a flying game, really) produced by Gunpei Yokoi, creator of Metroid and the Game Boy.

Upon arriving in the town York is greeted by town sheriff George Woodman and his deputy Emily Wyatt, who brief him on the murder and lead him to the crime scene. York generates considerable friction with his dismissive attitude toward the locals, bizarre demeanor, and tendency to interrupt conversations to deliver asides to &quot;Zach&quot;, an alternate personality congruent with the player. Over the course of his investigation, York has opportunities to touch the lives of many of the town's colorful personalities and intervene in their personal crises, often brought on by the sudden and brutal murder in their midst, to earn rewards and further his understanding of the case. As he unearths more and more mysteries and the killer continues to roam, the town's dark past slowly comes to light.<br/><br/>Deadly Premonition's plot and setting are strongly influenced by the American television show Twin Peaks, and numerous allusions and thematic links can be found within the game.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Deadly_Premonition,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72575": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Hunny Hopp", "playingtime": "10", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2035": "Roll / Spin and Move"}, "yearpublished": "2004", "usersrated": "2", "boardgamefamily": {"5597": "Celebrities: Walt Disney"}, "maxplayers": "4", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic744549_t.jpg", "average": "5.25", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"34": {"name": "Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic744549.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"41537": "German edition 2004"}, "maxplaytime": "10", "boardgamecategory": {"1041": {"name": "Children's Game"}}, "age": "5", "minplaytime": "10", "description": "From the back of the game box:<br/>&quot;An exciting, fast-paced game with Winnie the Pooh and his fiends.

The game's protagonist is Trevor C. Belmont, an ancestor of the original hero Simon Belmont.<br/><br/>Castlevania III abandons the adventure game elements of its immediate predecessor and returns to the platform game roots of the first Castlevania  title. Unlike Castlevania, however, Castlevania III is not strictly linear: Trevor, the main character, can be assisted by one of three possible assistant characters, and after completing the first level, and at several other points throughout the game, the player is given a choice of paths to follow. The choices made by the player in these circumstances can have a profound impact on how the game unfolds. There are 15 stages in total.<br/><br/>Castlevania III was the first game to use Konami's VRC6 chip, which is included in the cartridge to provide the console more capabilities. The VRC6 chip primarily added three audio channels to the system--allowing the game to use eight audio channels--as well as provide smoother animation for sprites. The game's audio programmer, Hidenori Maezawa, assisted in the chip's creation. The North American release replaced the VRC6 with Nintendo's Memory Management Controller (MMC) chip, specifically the MMC5 model. The MMC5 chip lacked the extra audio channels, and the game's music had to be downgraded to comply with the NES's standard five channels.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Castlevania_III:_Dracula's_Curse,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72585": {"boardgamedesigner": {"34843": {"name": "Nick Eyre"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Landser", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2072": "Dice Rolling"}, "yearpublished": "2000", "usersrated": "1", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic744710_t.jpg", "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"1001": {"name": "(Web published)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic744710.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"41561": "None"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1047": {"name": "Miniatures"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "Free set of World War II skirmish rules focused on squad vs squad level combat designed by Nick Eyre.

It is played with a standard deck of cards,along with six new types: Super Fives, Zero Card, Super Ace, Wild, Super Card, and the Master Card. In addition it uses a cribbage board which is a signature piece of equipment with holes and pegs for scoring.<br/><br/>Players are each dealt a hand of 6 cards, of which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib. One card is then cut from draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib. The players then alternately play a card, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences. Score is kept by moving pegs around tracks on the cribbage board. This is repeated until all players have exhausted their hand of cards. Once all players are out of cards, each player picks up his hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board. The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points. Then the cards are shuffled, the deal alternates, and the process is repeated.<br/><br/>2-players and teams of two play a full length game to 181 points. 3 individuals end play until 141 points. 4 individual players play to a standard cribbage length game of 121 points.<br/><br/>The six special cards are the crux of the game.<br/><br/>The Zero Card: When someone plays a card for a 15 or 31 during pegging, play the Zero-Card next to collect an additional 2 points for the 15 or 31. You must play the Zero-Card if you can played in a run or double run with zero, ace, and two.<br/><br/>The Super Ace: A Super-Ace pairs every ace. You can use a Super-Ace as a high ace for a run of queen, king and Super-Ace for both counting and pegging. The Super-Ace can be played as 1 or 11 during pegging. The value of the Super-Ace is 1 <u>and[/] 11 during counting (as though you had one of each card). The holder can also use as 1 and 11 with fours to total 15 points during counting the hand total.<br/><br/>Special Fives: Extra fives in play allows the high hand to go from 29 to 45 with 5 fives. The total points of  five 5&rsquo;s is 20. The 15 combinations are 20 and five pairs is another 20 making a total of 40 points.<br/><br/>Wild Cards: During pegging play you must use the Wild Card at the same face value as the point counting portion of the hand. Play a Wild Card as a seven during pegging, you must count it as a seven when you total your hand<br/><br/>The Super Wild: The Super-Wild is a Wild Card with one extra feature. It can be played during pegging as one face value and counted at another. You can play a Super-Wild as a seven during pegging and use it as a five during counting. If you play it as a 10 value you must specify it as a 10 or other face card value.<br/><br/>The Master: The Master is like a Super-Wild played as a separate face value during pegging and counting.

It was released for the Xbox and PlayStation 2, and received almost universally poor reviews.<br/><br/>In the game, Captain Hikaru Sulu and the crew of the USS Excelsior swap places with the crew of the mirror universe ISS Excelsior as a result of a localized stellar ion storm. They are hunted by Mirror-Chekov, who commands the ISS Enterprise, and assisted by the Klingons and Romulans. During their trek home, the Excelsior crew encounter mirror universe variations of the original series' missions, including the M5 multitronic computer (The Ultimate Computer), Balok, (The Corbomite Maneuver) The giant space amoeba, (The Immunity Syndrome), and the Planet Killer (The Doomsday Machine).<br/><br/>While the game takes place at some point during the era of the Star Trek films, it is unclear exactly when. The Enterprise has not yet been decommissioned (despite the fact that the order to return to Spacedock for decommissioning was given on Stardate 9529.1-this is in the short scene in 'our' universe-and Sulu's first log was on Stardate 9585.9), but Sulu is in command of the Excelsior, placing the game somewhere in the timeframe after Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. However, in the mirror universe, Spock has not yet completed his coup d'&eacute;tat -- the Empire contacts Mirror-Chekov several times during his mission to capture Sulu -- but there is still much time for that to occur in the mirror universe timeline.

Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics. It features a story arc from the movie, which was released on June 28, 2006, and more than 60 years of comic book content. EA Tiburon, known for its Madden NFL game series, has claimed that the game combines strong creative vision and compelling new technology to deliver a powerful and emotional gaming experience to their consumers, and they will experience a real sense of flying while mastering Superman's superhero  powers to save Metropolis.<br/><br/>In the game, Superman combats Metallo, who does not appear in the movie, as well as other classic villains as well as being able to play as Bizarro for a short period of time in one of the many minigames inserted into the game. The game was produced for the next-generation Xbox 360 as well as current generation platforms and handhelds although it was canceled for the PSP due to it not having enough power to support the game.<br/><br/>Electronic Arts and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment secured an all-star cast for the voices in Superman Returns: The Videogame. The game features the voice and likeness of Brandon Routh (Superman/Clark Kent) as well as the voices of Kevin Spacey (Lex Luthor), Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane), Parker Posey (Kitty Kowalski) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen), all reprising their roles from the Warner Bros. Pictures film directed by Bryan Singer.<br/><br/>The game was released on Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The Nintendo DS also featured games based on the film, but they are fundamentally different from the console title. The games were delayed from their original release date (set to coincide with the theatrical release of the film) due to design complications and issues with polish on the console game.[citation needed] The handheld games were delayed in order to preserve a simultaneous release with non-handheld SKUs. The games were ultimately released on November 22, 2006 in the United States and November 30 in Australia, to coincide with the DVD release of Superman Returns.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Superman_Returns_(video_game),&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72692": {"statistics": {}, "name": "You Don't Know Jack Volume 2", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"41994": "US Windows CD-ROM edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic741244.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5747": "You Don't Know Jack"}, "videogametheme": {"2350": "Movie, Book, TV show"}, "usersrated": "20", "average": "7.475", "videogamegenre": {"2169": "Trivia"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"167531": "You Don't Know Jack Huge XXXL"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic741244_t.jpg", "description": "[User Description]<br/><br/>You Don't Know Jack Volume 2 starts from the first game and adds on more.

Whether you're gamers are die-hard swashbucklers or you simply need a ship for a crucial plot point, the Maiden will fill a long time void in many RPG genres. Best of all, you don't need to blow hundreds of dollars and or weeks on a custom built ship for your miniatures. Build the Maiden in a matter of days and on a budget that will make you smile.<br/><br/>Gamers and model hobbyists alike will find many unique uses for the Maiden. A proud item to display on the gaming table and equally suited for the fireplace mantel ;) But what makes the Maiden especially unique is her ability to separate decks &quot;on the fly&quot;, allowing for multiple, simultaneous levels of game play!<br/>Multi-deck System:<br/><br/>The sterncastle, forecastle and main hull are all independent sections. Each has a roof that is easily removed to access interior elements with ease. Combat and general movement can take place on all decks simultaneously without the need to re-order other sections. The lower decks even accommodates a number of ornately detailed free floating walls, allowing you to create practically any interior hull layout.<br/>Multiple Miniatures Scale:<br/><br/>The Maiden of the High Seas is compatible with nearly all miniature scales. We've included 1-inch and 1.5-inch grids as well as no-grid versions of all the included decks.<br/>Masts and Sails:<br/><br/>With the Maiden's unique mast and yard design users can configure their ships sails in any number of ways in &quot;real time&quot;. Simply drop on the sail of your choice to change the look and feel of the ship. Even show &quot;raised sail states&quot; with a number of raised sail designs. A great way to give players a sense of what state the sails are in during a bad stretch of weather ;)<br/>Internal Props:<br/><br/>As usual WorldWorks has provided you with a number of highly detailed interior props to &quot;dress&quot; the inside of your ship and give it a rich pirate flair! From the captain's desk strewn with maps to the sweat stained hammocks, each element and texture have been carefully crafted to give you an authentic nautical feel. Bed trunks, tables, chairs, cargo crates, weathered cannons and of course the dreaded &quot;plank&quot; all add to an environment that will make your players feel like they are really there!<br/>Ink-Jet Transparencies:<br/><br/>Always innovating WorldWorks has incorporated the use of Ink-Jet transparencies in our designs to create intricate objects that are incredibly easy to build. Elements such as complex riggings, knotted roping (ratlines) and windows have been rendered with incredible detail specifically to be printed on transparencies. Other elements such as battle damage also use transparencies and can be placed anywhere on your ship that you want to show damage (blood, burn marks, broken decking, cannon holes, dents). Think of transparencies as &quot;Alpha channels&quot; for cardstock modeling.<br/>Masterboard:<br/><br/>It wouldn't be a WorldWorks product if we didn't include a Masterboard and this one is special. To create a convincing ocean worthy of your creation we've put together a large format area of water with specular lighting, reflectivity's and wave effects that ground your model in an aura of believability. A series of twelve water tiles make up an image that will convince &quot;some&quot; that you've imported your own piece of the ocean right to your gaming table ;)<br/>Huge Kitbashing potential:<br/><br/>(&quot;Kitbashing&quot;- To re-order the elements within a model set to come up with new designs.)<br/>The Maiden is almost made with &quot;Kitbashing&quot; in mind. Extend the central hull as long as you like, add more masts, change sail designs, make her stubby, make her long. There is monstrous kitbashing potential here and with the support of a large and dedicated community at WorldWorks you can exchange ideas and pictures with fellow modelers. Build one, build a fleet!<br/><br/>Pull all of this together with detailed, printer friendly, step by step, photographed instructions, user support via the WorldWorks forums and you have one product that is hard to pass up.

It was developed in 1987 by Time Warp Productions for the C64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST and Amiga.<br/><br/>During the mid-80s, there were at several times unfounded rumours that Supeer Mario Bros would get a C64 port, probably because all C64 owners wanted one. Giana Sisters was probably developped to satisfy this demand.<br/><br/>The first two stages are next to identical to the first two stages in Super Mario Bros, but the following 30 are not. Giana Sisters evolved some of the concepts from Super Mario Bros, allowing, among other things, for several kinds of weapons.<br/><br/>About the release date: <br/>The exact release date of this game is unknown. What is known is that the C64 version was created in 1987 (C64 title screen) but that some information about the game is credited to 1988 (other versions info). That the game was released for C64 in 1987 and other platforms in 1988 is practically impossible, as Nintendo was quick to react and the game was in the shops only a matter of days, and this concerned all versions. The most plausible explanation is that the C64 simply was created in 1987, but not released until 1988. This would also explain why the C64 version of Giana Sisters was widely spread in software piracy circles long before the game reached the shops.<br/><br/>The game was sequelled by the game Hard'n'Heavy that was initially titled &quot;Giana Sisters 2&quot;. By changing the sprite graphics, the game wasn't accused of IP infringement by Nintendo. It never, however, reached the cult acclaim of its predecessor.<br/><br/>From As of 2005, a new version titled simply Giana Sisters has been made available for mobile phones. There is also an unofficial fangame titled Giana's Return for Windows, GP2x and GP2X Wiz. A port of the Commodore 64 version was made for the Nintendo DS.<br/>In April 2009, publisher DTP Entertainment and developer Spellbound Interactive, owner of the game's IP released a new Giana Sisters game in Europe with an extensive graphical update for the Nintendo DS. It has since been released in Australia. The game features all-new levels and more gameplay elements, and a recreation of the original game's levels can be unlocked.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Giana_sisters,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>Individual credits:<br/>Chris Huelsbeck: Music (C64)<br/><br/>"}, "72747": {"boardgamedesigner": {"2614": {"name": "Roland Weiniger"}}, "average": "4", "poll": {}, "name": "Landbierparadies", "playingtime": "15", "minplayers": "2", "boardgamemechanic": {"2041": "Card Drafting"}, "yearpublished": "2010", "usersrated": "2", "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic746678_t.jpg", "boardgameartist": {"36272": "Adelson Tavares"}, "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"11824": {"name": "Game Engineers"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic746678.jpg", "boardgameversion": {"42123": "First edition"}, "maxplaytime": "15", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "15", "description": "Every region in Germany has its own traditions and conventions when it comes to drinking their national beverage.

The game is the second installment of the Heroes of Might and Magic series and is typically credited as the breakout game for the series. Heroes II was voted the sixth-best PC game of all time by PC Gamer  in May 1997.<br/><br/>Heroes II introduced several new features that have since become standard for the series. First among them is the ability for heroes to gain special abilities. Each hero can possess up to eight different secondary skills out of fourteen available. Once gained, a skill can be developed from Basic to Advanced and Expert levels. For example, the Wisdom skill allows a hero to learn spells of level 3 and higher, while the Logistics skill increases the hero's movement ability over land. In Heroes I, heroes had a single fixed special ability according to their class.<br/><br/>The magic system was changed in Heroes II. Heroes I had used a memorization system in which each spell could be cast a certain number of times before being exhausted. Heroes II uses a magic point system that allows the player to apportion spell use as needed, while the varying point cost of different spells maintains balance.<br/><br/>Another major feature introduced in Heroes II is the ability to upgrade units, granting them improved statistics and, in some cases, important abilities. For example, upgrading Vampires to Vampire Lords enables them to absorb health and even to resurrect units.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_II:_The_Succession_Wars,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72759": {"videogame": {"80896": "Heroes of Might and Magic Compendium"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Heroes of Might and Magic II: The Price of Loyalty", "videogamemode": {"2409": "Hotseat"}, "videogameversion": {"42154": "US Windows Edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic900049.jpg", "videogameseries": {"4803": "Heroes of Might and Magic"}, "videogametheme": {"2148": "Fantasy"}, "videogamegenre": {"2158": "Strategy"}, "videogameexpansion": {"72758": "Heroes of Might and Magic II: The Succession Wars"}, "average": "7.79167", "videogamefranchise": {"5677": "Might and Magic"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "usersrated": "48", "poll": {}, "videogamecompilation": {"80896": "Heroes of Might and Magic Compendium"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic900049_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;The Price of Loyalty is the expansion pack for Heroes II, released in 1997.

It is a game of tales told to scare the bejeezus out of your friends when sleeping out under the clear night sky; of tales of beasts and monsters and murderous psychopaths; of tales that might just turn out to be true.<br/><br/>In Dead of Night players take on the roles of characters within a horror movie - the screaming victims, the fearless monster hunters and sometimes even the slavering monsters themselves. They play the characters about to be thrust into whatever peril the games master has planned. Whilst the players play out their roles within the horror movie, the games master has no single role to play - instead he sets up the story, describes the locations, plays the rest of the cast and controls the monster.<br/><br/>Dead of Night is all about the monsters - the werewolves, the ghosts and the ghouls. It is meant to scare the players, to make them jump at their own shadows and the clatter of the dice. It is meant to unsettle and disturb, to make them think twice before turning off the lights. It is meant to be light hearted at times, when the horror movie clich&eacute;s flow thicker than the blood. Above all, it is meant to be fun!<br/><br/>Dead of Night is designed to be quick and easy to play, with rules that help you tell horror stories without getting in the way of the fun. The rules are simple and straightforward to learn, yet offer a variety of options and depth to allow you to customise the game however you like.<br/><br/>"}, "72761": {"boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Fragments", "playingtime": "0", "minplayers": "0", "yearpublished": "0", "usersrated": "0", "maxplayers": "0", "average": "0", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3320": {"name": "(Unknown)"}}, "boardgameversion": {"42156": "English first edition"}, "maxplaytime": "0", "boardgamecategory": {"1030": {"name": "Party Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "0", "description": "A 1920s party game in which participants hunt down cards which have been scattered around a room.

It was filmed over a three-week period in 1987 for an unreleased game entitled &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot;. The footage was placed into archive when that game failed to materialize, but the footage was later used to create a game by Digital Pictures which in total reportedly cost US$1.5 million to produce. This game became Night Trap, which was originally developed for Hasbro's NEMO system, which used VHS tapes instead of ROM cartridges. However, when Hasbro scrapped production on the NEMO, Night Trap was moved to the Sega CD and later brought to the Sega 32X, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, and PC platforms with higher-quality video. The game utilized full-motion video scenes entirely and is notorious for the controversy it brewed in 1993, resulting in US Senate hearings and withdrawal of the game from the market and the creation of the ESRB.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Night_Trap,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72774": {"rpgitemversion": {"42195": "PDF Version"}, "statistics": {}, "name": "Himmelveil HarborMaster", "rpgproducer": {"24762": "Paul Senior"}, "average": "0", "usersrated": "0", "rpg": {"356": "Generic / Universal"}, "rpgcategory": {"2086": "Accessory (dice, maps, screens, cards)"}, "poll": {}, "rpggenre": {"961": "Fantasy"}, "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Where the Kriegstrom River meets the mouth of the Mysserian Sea, the ancient City of Himmelveil stands watch over distant shores.<br/><br/>WorldWorks is proud to present our first release in the fantasy mega-city of &lsquo;Himmelveil&rsquo;; &lsquo;Himmelveil Harbormaster&rsquo;. The city of Himmelveil marks a grand plan by WorldWorks designers to bring into creation an entire fantasy city in cardstock glory. Working from a carefully created grand master plan we are carving out sections of the city for development by our highly skilled model creators. Our dream is an ambitious one; to give every gamer and modeler the tools they need to build a massive and affordable fantasy city for all of their role playing needs. The journey has begun! It&rsquo;s time for you to join us!<br/><br/>Himmelveil Harbormaster&rsquo; is a superbly textured and detailed (both inside and out) multi-storied building with several optional components. How many stories? That&rsquo;s completely up to you! It sits on an optional 3-inch high stonework pier. This model set is a perfect event based location that is equally suited to fantasy, horror and modern gaming scenarios. The only real limit here is your imagination.<br/><br/>(Game Notes)<br/><br/>This is the home and working space of Cinaed Audoenus, a retired voyager. In younger years he explored the far reaches of Arcraetia but in his age he has settled here as Harbormaster to Himmelveil. His years spent bending elbow with mariners in waterfront taverns around the world has earned him deep respect locally as a knowledgeable seaman.<br/><br/>The office is usually crowded during business hours with mariners seeking or departing from berths. It's a prime place for news, rumors and shady characters. The harbormaster is in or near the lower floor office space during the day; an overworked clerk does most of the admin work and is only hired during office hours. There are usually large sums of cash in a variety of coinage in the office late in the afternoon. A Harborside Marine is assigned to guard the money.<br/><br/>The building has two floors with fully detailed interior and exterior. Multiple levels of ornate detail can be added to the windows, ranging from a a quick and easy build, to an elaborate work of cardstock art. In addition, Himmelveil Harbormaster includes all of the following:<br/><br/>* Interior: Desk<br/>    * Counter<br/>    * Chairs<br/>    * Captain's Bed<br/>    * Wardrobe<br/>    * Ladder<br/>    * 3 tables<br/>    * Steps<br/>    * File Box<br/>    * Strongbox<br/>    * Fireplaces<br/><br/>Exterior:<br/>    * Tower with small window, clock and anti-dragon spikes<br/>    * Skylight<br/>    * Mansard Roof<br/>    * Flagpole with Signal Flags<br/>    * Ship's wheel<br/>    * Hatch<br/><br/>The building can sit atop a three inch high pillar, accessible by exterior steps leading to two small platforms that come in gridded and non-grid variations.<br/><br/>"}, "72775": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic377212.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"3": {"name": "(Uncredited)"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2008", "maxplayers": "10", "boardgamepublisher": {"157": {"name": "Asmodee"}}, "maxplaytime": "60", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic377212_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1042": {"name": "Expansion for Base-game"}}, "description": "Catalina Santana is the 4th female driver to join the Formula D family.

Ground defenses are more varied and include three different walkers, various laser turrets, probe droids and stormtroopers.<br/><br/>The heads-up display features a health meter, a radar, an ammunition count for secondary weapons and the &quot;command cross&quot; that allows the player to give limited instructions to their wingmen. The player can control six craft: X-wing, A-wing, Y-wing, B-wing, Snowspeeder and the T-16 Skyhopper. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft. Some levels offer the player the option to change craft mid-level. Eleven bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons, durability and targeting computer and are applied to each eligible craft for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>The player's performance is measured throughout the game, and performance statistics are checked after each level against three medal benchmarks. Each benchmark contains six categories: completion time, number of enemies destroyed, shot accuracy, number of friendly craft and structures saved, number of lives lost and targeting computer efficiency. If a player's performance meets or exceeds one of the level's three benchmarks in all six categories, a medal&mdash;bronze, silver or gold&mdash;is awarded on completion. Acquiring these medals promotes the player's rank and helps unlock hidden content. Once the player completes all of the training missions and achieves gold medals on all 15 levels, the opportunity to activate &quot;Ace Mode&quot; is awarded. The player may then achieve one more medal per level by completing them with this mode activated.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Star_Wars_Rogue_Squadron_II:_Rogue_Leader,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72793": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike", "videogamemode": {"2313": "Cooperative"}, "videogameversion": {"42258": "JP GameCube edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic945351.png", "videogameseries": {"5750": "Star Wars: Rogue Squadron"}, "videogametheme": {"2264": "Science Fiction"}, "videogamefranchise": {"6395": "Player's Choice (Best Selling Nintendo Games, US & EU)"}, "usersrated": "25", "average": "7.272", "videogamegenre": {"2147": "Action"}, "videogameplatform": {"4425": "GameCube"}, "videogamehonor": {"30913": "2003 Spike Best Action Adventure Game of the Year Nominee"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic945351_t.png", "description": "From the back of the box (US GameCube edition)<br/><br/>Strike against the evil Empire!

The background starfield also emerges from the screen's center, the stars travelling to the screen's edge, giving the impression that the ship is travelling into the screen at high speed, as if it were in a tube, hence the name &quot;tube shooter&quot;.<br/><br/>Gyruss was designed by Yoshiki Okamoto, who had earlier created Time Pilot for Konami. Gyruss was licensed to Centuri in the United States, and was ported to numerous games consoles and home computers. It follows in the tradition of space war games such as Space Invaders and Galaga.<br/><br/>Gyruss was the second and last game Yoshiki Okamoto designed for Konami, after Time Pilot. Due to pay disputes, he was fired after the release of this game, and soon joined Capcom, where he would write 1942 and the first Street Fighter game.<br/><br/>The game's background music is an electronic, fast-paced arrangement of J.

Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is universally considered as one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games, and an icon of the 1980s popular culture. Upon its release, the game--and, subsequently, Pac-Man derivatives--became a social phenomenon that sold a bevy of merchandise and also inspired, among other things, an animated television series and a top-ten hit single.<br/><br/>When Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were space shooters, in particular Space Invaders and Asteroids. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivative of Pong. Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre and appealing to both genders. Pac-Man is often credited with being a landmark in video game history, and is among the most famous arcade games of all time. The character also appears in more than 30 officially licensed game spin-offs, as well as in numerous unauthorized clones and bootlegs. According to the Davie-Brown Index, Pac-Man has the highest brand awareness of any video game character among American consumers, recognized by 94 percent of them. Pac-Man is one of the longest running video game franchises from the golden age of video arcade games, and one of only three video games that are on display at the Smithsonian in Washington D.C., (along with Pong and Dragon's Lair).&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;Pac_man,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72798": {"rpgitemversion": {"42328": "German Hardcover"}, "rpgseries": {"4200": "Lovecraft Country Collection"}, "name": "Sturm auf Innsmouth", "rpgproducer": {"19530": "Frank Heller"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic741450.jpg", "usersrated": "3", "rpgsetting": {"2572": "Cthulhu Classic (1920s & 1930s)"}, "average": "7", "statistics": {}, "rpg": {"310": "Call of Cthulhu (2nd - 6th Edition)"}, "poll": {}, "rpgcategory": {"2084": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, "rpggenre": {"988": "Horror (Cthulhu Mythos)"}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic741450_t.jpg", "description": "(user summary)<br/>This scenario book contains several adventures that take place in the cursed costal town of Innmouth.<br/>Included are both translations and new adventures written for this book:<br/><br/>Der Leuchtturm von Skivern Rock (The Occulted Light - translation)<br/>Dagons Sohn (Dagon's Son - new)<br/>Der Zwist (The Brawl - new)<br/>Flucht aus Innsmouth (Escape from Innsmouth - translation)<br/>Sturm auf Innsmouth (The Raid on Innsmouth - translation)<br/><br/>"}, "72799": {"boardgameversion": {"42329": "First edition"}, "boardgamedesigner": {"428": {"name": "Dan Verssen"}}, "poll": {}, "name": "Battle for Stalingrad", "playingtime": "60", "minplayers": "2", "yearpublished": "2014", "usersrated": "116", "boardgamesubdomain": {"4666": "Abstract Games"}, "maxplayers": "2", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1584978_t.jpg", "average": "6.89483", "statistics": {}, "boardgamepublisher": {"3683": {"name": "Dan Verssen Games (DVG)"}}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1584978.jpg", "boardgamefamily": {"10643": "Country: Germany"}, "maxplaytime": "60", "boardgamecategory": {"1002": {"name": "Card Game"}}, "age": "0", "minplaytime": "60", "description": "The Battle for Stalingrad lasted 200 days, from July 17, 1942 to February 2, 1943.

It was ported to a large number of 8-bit consoles at the time.<br/><br/>A 2D platform action game like Manic Miner, in Jet Set Willy the player controls the rather flat-faced character Miner Willy, jumping around on screens filled with enemies that move on the screen following a certain scheme, and that will kill on touch. As Willy can't be controlled in mid-air, the game is all about high-precision jumps to avoid the enemies and collect the blinking items on screen.<br/><br/>Unlike Manic Miner, which is about clearing one screen after the other, in Jet Set Willy the player explores all rooms in a vast mansion consisting of no less than 60 rooms, and the goal of the game is to collect all items in all rooms, or the housekeeper Maria won't let Willy go to bed. This has to be done before midnight, which accounts for 5 hours of playing time as the game starts at 7 PM.<br/><br/>If Willy is killed, he loses one life and is returned to exactly where he entered the room, keeping any momentum, which can be disastrous if he enters a room in a way that will get him killed; this will cause a chain-reaction of losing all remaining lives. This, combined with the fact that all rooms require a meticulous jumping, has earned Jet Set Willy the rumour of being one of the most difficult platform games ever released.<br/><br/>The game was planned to be released on the Amiga and Atari ST in 1989, but near completion, Software Projects cancelled the release as they regarded JSW as being out of its time.

The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.<br/><br/>Video game critics gave the game a mixed reaction. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor camera system, which did not always function properly. The Simpsons Game received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the 2007 Writers Guild of America Awards. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;The_Simpsons_Game,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72887": {"statistics": {}, "name": "The Devil Inside", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"42564": "English/UK Windows Release"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3250489.jpg", "videogametheme": {"2265": "Horror"}, "usersrated": "3", "average": "4.66667", "videogamegenre": {"2167": "Shooter"}, "videogameplatform": {"4977": "Windows"}, "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3250489_t.jpg", "description": "&quot;The Devil Inside is a horror-themed third-person shooter video game released in 2000 by Cryo Interactive.

The game is played in a flick-screen environment, with most screens presenting the player with some sort of puzzle to reach the exit, occasionally some dexterity test. Most dangerous object kill at a touch.<br/><br/>The two creatures have different capabilities: Head can jump high and glide in the air, but walks slowly, whereas Heels runs quickly and can carry one object, but barely jump. When combined, Headoverheels can both run quickly, pick up objects and jump high, but is big and can therefore not fit everywhere. How to advance through the rooms is a matter of clever thinking of pushing and lifting objects, out-maneuvering enemies and skillful jumping.<br/><br/>Once escaped from the initial prison, the goal of the game is to free four imprisoned worlds.

It is based around Space Pirates. Though similar to BANG!, there are several unique twists. Each player has his own unique objective, and his own unique card set based on his own unique alien race. Each player commands a ship that has 15 Hit Points. Hits are usually taken using Dice. However, while some players may have powerful attacks, the focus of the game for many players is not to destroy the other players but to accomplish an objective.<br/><br/>Samples:<br/>Akzinal - A traditional thief. His goal is to capture all treasures.<br/>Felian - A snakelike race, the Felian are tremendously territorial. Their objective is to be the last Faction standing.<br/>Homin - This hominid race lived relatively peacefully until an alien race sent an explosive that destroyed many lives, not including the lives that were lost. The Homin Captain seeks to find and neutralize the alien menace.<br/>Morph - As their name suggests, the Morph are a race of appearance-altering people who have developed their ships to transform as well. Always seeking to attain transcendence, the Morph try to do so by learning from other people. Their objective is to acquire technologies from all other factions.<br/>Ralyk - Wolf Men. Because their genetics prevent their reproduction, the only way they can continue as a race is to (naturally) turn others into Wolf Men. They prominently seek out the Alphas of each species. This said, their objective is to capture all opposing Captains through duel or by kidnapping.<br/>Var*por - A squidlike race who travel aboard live ships. These ships look like rays but hold solar powers. Thus they are called StarRay in first phase and SunRay in later phase. The objective is to raise a StarRay to its second phase and lead it to a New Birth phase where another StarRay is born.<br/>Wallaboo - A small teleporting Kangaroo race who stow away on ships and influence the playing field. They maneuver game play while attempting to remain unnoticed and escape capture. Their objective is to be free aboard the winning ship.<br/><br/>Objectives that are well thought out with interesting back-story, only made more incredible by the fact that this game is so easy to play.<br/><br/>As stated, each faction has their own unique abilities, but a shared deck unites them all. In this shared deck are Detonator Cards (the central card which allows players to make basic attacks or to play their faction cards), Evasion Tactics which protect ships from attack, Quick Fix cards to restore Hit Points, Steal cards that allow players to steal Faction abilities from other factions (including Captains and Treasures), Void cards which return continuous abilities to their decks, and other (more unique) abilities.<br/><br/>Dueling, a major factor of Traditional Bang, is now done exclusively in battle for captains. (All players may Duel for opposing captains, as Captain cards hold unique abilities. This was also true of Traditional Bang). This does not require the use of cards. Any player can Duel with an opponent that has less than 1/2 Hit Points. Each Captain has his own HP rating, and a series of D6 Dice Rolls resolves a Duel. The winner retains the opponent's captain along with his unique ability.<br/><br/>Another new feature of Shores of Heaven is a mini game called Common Threat, wherein 2 D6's are rolled and the values are multiplied. Players must work together to destroy the Common Threat before returning to play. Each player who fails to neutralize the threat loses 1 HP. The Victor redeems all lost HP.<br/><br/>FOLLOWING IS A SIMPLE RULE SET. SOON, WITH PRINTABLE CARDS TO BE UPLOADED, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME WITHIN A FEW MINUTES...<br/><br/>START <br/>Along with cards, you will need a D4 and a D6 to play. (Unique sided dice are usually inexpensive and can be found on the internet or at specialty board game shops.)<br/>After Starting Position has been determined, each player pulls a faction at random from the SPECIES deck. This card remains face up until the faction is removed from play. There are two SPECIES decks, only one of which has a WALLABOO card. If the WALLABOO card is chosen, the Wallaboo faction keeps the additional SPECIES deck to mark his current position. His position is revealed to only the player who plays the IMPRISONMENT card. (Each faction has an IMPRISONMENT card in his FACTION deck.) If the Wallaboo plays his TRUCE card, his position is then revealed to all players.<br/>At this point, all players but the Homin also receive a THREAT card, distinguishing them as a Menace or as Benign.<br/>OBJECTIVES:<br/>Akz&iacute;nal - Acquire all treasures. This can be done using a STEAL card from the SHARED deck or a FILCH card from your personal deck. The treasure is returned to your opponent if 1) It is VOIDED. 2) It is STOLEN. 3) It is taken back using 2 DETONATOR cards. 4) You are destroyed. (It is reshuffled into the FACTION deck.)<br/>Felian - Be the last Faction standing. Your Treasure card can help, as it allows you to regenerate after 1 round destroyed. This card stays in effect until it is stolen or voided.<br/>Homin - Hunt and neutralize the Menace. THREAT cards distributed at the start of play determine the Menace. If the Menace is destroyed by someone else, THREAT cards are redistributed. You must destroy the Menace yourself.<br/>Morph - Steal and hold Faction cards from each opponent. These are considered learned abilities, and may be made Lasting Effects, regardless of status, as long as your treasure is in play. (See CARD SYMBOLS for details.) Addendum: Wallaboo movement cards effect range. Sabotage card (in Wallaboo deck) counts against your HP, and is returned to the Wallaboo deck as soon as acquired.<br/>Ralyk - Acquire all Captains. This can be done using a Steal card, or by Dueling. (See CAPTAIN DUEL for details.) If an opponent&rsquo;s ship is destroyed, his captain is left out, and a Steal card can acquire the Captain for you. <br/>V&auml;r&middot;por - Raise your StarRay to New Birth phase. See SunRay gauge. (This is a narrow purple sheet marked with 15 movements and contains pictures of SunRays at all phases.)<br/>Wallaboo - Remain free aboard the winning faction&rsquo;s ship. If imprisoned (See Imprisonment cards), you cannot play any of your cards. You can, however, discard and collect cards each round until you hold the Escape card. (Since it has a cost of 2 Detonator cards, you will want those in your hand when you find it.)<br/>CARDS You will start with 2 FACTION cards and 5 SHARED DECK cards. This is the maximum number of cards you will hold in your hand. However, both at the start and end of your turn you will be able to replenish your hand. (Thus Attack does not penalyze Defense.) You may only discard unwanted cards at the end of your turn, before replenishing your hand. <br/>Cards of the same type may be stacked to boost effect. I.E. Because of this, a player who has 2 FOCUS cards may be able to roll a maximum value of 8 with a D4.<br/>CARD SYMBOLS Each card likely has 1 or both of 2 symbols. The first is LE (Lasting Effect). The card may be played down to be in permanent use. The second is #D. This indicates how many Detonator cards must be played to use the card. If the LE has a #D over it, this indicates that there is a cost to make the card a lasting effect. If the card has LE and #D on opposite cards, it may be played as a Lasting Effect but you must play as many Detonator cards for each use.<br/>CAPTAINS&rsquo; DUEL - Each Captain Card has a number in the upper right corner. This is how many hits a captain may take before he is defeated. Each time a Duel takes place, both captains start with full HP. Both captains roll a D6. When one opponent rolls higher, the opposite loses 1 HP. This is repeated until 1 captain is lost. Captains may only back out of a Captains&rsquo; Duel if a truce is agreed upon. The winner keeps the opponent&rsquo;s captain as prisoner and can use the additional Captain&rsquo;s ability freely. If you lose your Captain, you can only rescue the captain using a Steal card, or a Void card. Any captain can duel with an opponent&rsquo;s captain so long as the challenged opponent has less than &frac12; HP. <br/>VOID - This card usually means the opponent forfeit&rsquo;s a card of his choice. However, if you play a VOID card with a DETONATOR card, you may roll a D4. Rolling a 4 or higher (using bonus cards) can give you the ability to choose which Lasting Effects are voided. This can prove a useful tool in recollecting Captains and Treasures as the VOID card returns cards to their Faction decks.<br/>COMMON THREAT - When this card is found, it is played immediately. Roll 2 D6&rsquo;s, and multiply the scores. Each player in succession uses their attack cards to destroy the common threat. If the player fails to destroy the threat, he loses 1 HP. This continues until the threat is destroyed. The Victor receives all lost HP. The player of this card may determine the initial opponent after the dice roll. (This means that some clever calculation can result in a quick HP boost for him.)<br/>RANGE  - Unless otherwise stated, all attacks have a range of 1 in either direction. Captains&rsquo; Duel is maximum range. <br/>TREASURES - All opponents may steal treasures to use opponents&rsquo; treasure abilities.<br/><br/>"}, "72902": {"statistics": {}, "name": "Discworld Noir", "videogamemode": {"2149": "Single-Player"}, "videogameversion": {"42614": "European PlayStation edition"}, "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic774319.jpg", "videogameseries": {"5928": "Discworld"}, "videogametheme": {"2280": "Crime"}, "videogamefranchise": {"5929": "Discworld"}, "average": "7.5", "videogamegenre": {"2152": "Adventure"}, "videogameplatform": {"4433": "PlayStation"}, "usersrated": "12", "poll": {}, "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic774319_t.jpg", "description": "[From the back of the game]:<br/><br/>The Name's Lewton, and the dame I'm working for wrote the book on trouble - and the sequal too.

The player's aim is to stop the forces of Chaos that invade the world of Ancardia.<br/><br/>Like most roguelikes, ADOM uses ASCII graphics to represent the game world. It features a wilderness map that connects different types of dungeons. Most dungeons are randomly generated upon first enterance. Once visited, they, with the exception of the Infinite Dungeon, do not change when re-entered during play.<br/><br/>ADOM presents an initial choice of one (male or female) player character from ten races and twenty character classes, the combination of which strongly affects gameplay, in both subtle and obvious ways. Among other traits, character development includes experience levels, statistics, and skills. Version 1.1.0 introduced a talent system,[3] allowing further customization of characters, based on a hierarchical system of prerequisites.<br/><br/>During adventures, a player is likely to explore many areas and complete multiple quests. Which quests are available may depend on character experience level or alignment (lawful, neutral, or chaotic). Alignment also affects NPC and deity interaction with the character. How one solves a quest can also affect one's alignment, such that a chaotic character seeking redemption can eventually become lawful through his or her actions (or vice versa).<br/><br/>ADOM offers multiple ways of winning, which vary in difficulty. The regular ending that appeared first in ADOM development, consists of locating and closing the gate through which the chaos forces infiltrate the game world Ancardia. The player also has the option to enter the gate, providing access to special endings, which are generally considered more difficult to accomplish. ADOM's quest-centric, plot-driven structure owes as much to adventure games like Zork as to the hack-and-slash of sibling games like Angband.&quot;<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;ADOM,&quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>"}, "72941": {"image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic745802.jpg", "poll": {}, "boardgamedesigner": {"335": {"name": "Frank Chadwick"}}, "statistics": {}, "yearpublished": "2010", "maxplayers": "2", "boardgameartist": {"11909": "Todd Davis"}, "boardgamepublisher": {"6348": {"name": "Consim Press"}}, "maxplaytime": "120", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic745802_t.jpg", "minplaytime": "120", "boardgamecategory": {"1019": {"name": "Wargame"}}, "boardgamehonor": {"21162": "2010 Charles S.

Although greatly outnumbered, the British dominated by outmaneuvering the Italians with their superior armored vehicles. In the battles of Sidi Barani, Bardia, Tobruk, and Mechili, the Italian 10th Army had been soundly defeated but remained intact to defend the gates of Tripoli.<br/><br/>On this, the 58th day of the offensive, the remaining operational tanks of 7th British Armoured Division and a small advanced detachment of men, guns, and armored cars are attempting to block the last escape route for the Italians.<br/><br/>The Italians, yet unaware of the fast approaching Western Desert blocking force, will soon find themselves desperately racing against time to break through near the small village of Beda Fomm and escape into Tripolitania before it&rsquo;s too late.<br/><br/>The time is 1200 hrs, 5 February 1941<br/><br/>The complete destruction of the remnants of the Italian 10th Army hangs in the balance.<br/><br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Beda Fomm marks the triumphant return of one of the truly classic gaming gems originally released in 1979 by Game Designers Workshop during what many consider the heyday of traditional conflict simulation gaming.

As the Italian player, you have strength in overall numbers, but your formations are brittle and are hampered by a lack of maneuverability in attempting to break through and escape complete destruction.

Few wizards have ever memorized or prepared a spell, and even fewer forget them immediately afterwards. In the Elements of Magic, each character has only a single spellcasting level, no matter how many types of magic she learns in her career. The Elements of Magic gives characters many times the options of the standard d20 rules. Individual spells are replaced by spell lists. Instead of learning a fireball spell, for example, a mage could learn the Evoke Area Fire spell list, which is very flexible as to its usage and appearance. Nor is the mage limited to fire evocations ? with 20 elements to choose from, she could learn Evoke Area Ice or Lightning, or an even more exotic spell list, such as Imbue Creature with Lava or Shadow.
